As you know, the performance review process is currently underway.  If you 
have not already done so, please go into the performance review system and 
select individuals to give feedback on your performance during this review 
period.  Generally, it is recommended to select 6-8 reviewers.  The system 
closes for feedback on November 17th.  Attached, please find a one page quick 
overview to assist with the process.  Should you have questions, contact your 
HR Representative Jeanie Slone at x53847.
