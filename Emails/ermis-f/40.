PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate 
x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, 
the 
following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid 
Quantity x 
days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to 
improve its bid 
by submitting an improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such 
improved bid 
shall be faxed to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a 
tie still 
exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.
