ENA will be filing tomorrow the attached protest of PG&E-NW's 2002 Pipeline 
Expansion Project.  Our protest is based on the fact that the project could 
increase fuel costs for existing shippers by 20% or more, according to the 
illustrative fuel rates PG&E-NW discussed at its last customer meeting.
