The scheduled Station 3 maintenance has caused a restriction greater than
anticipated.  For that reason, the Kingsgate capacity will be further
limited to 2220 MMcf/d beginning with the Intra-day 1 cycle for Gas Day 4/26
and will remain in effect until further notice.

If you have any questions, please call our transportation coordinators at
(503) 833-4300.
