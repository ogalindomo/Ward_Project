Sorry about this guys, I put the wrong date on the last memo reminding you of 
Tori's shower.  It is this Thursday, May 10th, not May 19th.

Just a reminder about Tori's baby shower next Thursday (May 19 @2:30).  If 
you would like me to shop for you (at Babysrus), just let me know or you can 
donate to a pool of money and I will pick out some items.
