Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to remind you that only postID of calcs that have TDS Flag (in 
Port Calc screen) set to "1" are included in TDS position load.  We have 
noticed that ST-Bammel, ST-Bridgeline, GD-Texas,... and many more desks do 
not have the TDS Flag set to "1".

Please call me (x30413) or Bill Kasemervisz (x57579) if you have any 
questions.

Kenny H.
