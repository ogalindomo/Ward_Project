The following updates have been made to the EnronOnline Website and should be 
available to all customers on their login today:

- Ability to type in volumes in the Submission Box (rather than just using 
the arrows)
- Removal of the "Hour Glassing" effect (in which the browser acted like the 
site was still loading when it was in fact finished)
- New code to fix the caching server issues which prevented some customers 
from successfully upgrading
- Addition of Dow Jones News Feeds (automatic for appropriate categories)

If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline Help 
Desk at:
