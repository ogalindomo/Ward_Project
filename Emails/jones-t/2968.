Hello Everyone

Our Westlaw representative, Michael Springer, will be available to us for 
training this Thursday, August 3rd at 2:00pm in conference room EB38C2.  

 The training is free to Enron users.  I encourage you to attend this 
"research set-up" training and get a solid, good foundation for your research 
projects, especially since the New Beta of Westlaw was recently released. 

Please advise me by return email if you would like to attend.  The training 
should be approximately one hour, with additional time for questions if 
needed.  Due to the short notice, your prompt reply is necessary.
