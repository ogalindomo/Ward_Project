Tana:

Stacy needs to talk with her to decide if it's appropriate to trade under the 
GISB.  If she agrees, we shouldn't need to amend the ETA -- the GISB will 
become an "applicable master" under the terms of the ETA and all nat gas 
transactions eligible for trading under the GISB would be confirmed under the 
GISB contract, to the extent the nat gas group sends confirms.  Give Denise a 
call back and let her know to expect a call from Stacy.

Stacy:

Please all this woman and discuss her request re the GISB agreement.  Then, 
give me a call so that we can discuss your determination and to make sure I 
can respond accurately to her ETA concern.

Leslie

PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure 
that they can trade it under the GISB.  They want to amend the ETA to that 
effect.  I'm not sure how we want to handle this.  Get Stacy/Jeff's approval 
that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?  The 
woman who called is Denise Pocius at (973) 430-8181.
