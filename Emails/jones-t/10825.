I apologize if the document was not attached.  I did, however, check the 
e-mail to Ed and confirmed it was attached.  Below is the version I 
forwarded.  If there is a problem opening the attached or the attached not 
showing up, please call Tana Jones at 713-853-3399.   She will be able to 
address the problem.

I will be traveling on business for the next couple of days, but will be back 
in the office on Wednesday.

		 Subject: NDA for GSX meeting

Erol Benjenk, who is the Director of Business Development at GSX, shared with 
me an e-mail regarding the NDA Enron would like us to sign before we have the 
meeting scheduled for April 18.  For some reason, the NDA was not attached; 
and I would like our lawyers to review it.  Could you please send a copy 
directly to me at lschorsch@gsx.com?  I am the CEO of GSX.  Best regards.
