Please remove Mary Gosnell and Adnan Patel from the Clickpaper distributions 
to Global because they are no longer with our group.
Please add Bernice Rodriguez (Sam Schott's backup), Kelly Lombardi (my 
backup), and Bill Hare (manager of Global counterparty) to the distributions 
for Global.

Thank you,
