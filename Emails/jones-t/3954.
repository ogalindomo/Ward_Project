JUST FOR FUN!

I have recently discovered some great morning traffic music on KPFT 90.1 on a 
show called "Mary in the Morning."  I wish it were me, but it must be another 
Mary who likes fun music too, such as Dance the Night Away by the Mavericks!  
Anyway, it is a fun way to get in the Enron Mood in the morning!
