Attached is the preliminary report for March, 2001.  Please note that there 
are overlays that were completed in the system TODAY, but most were completed 
prior to this distribution and notification was sent at the time the changes 
were made.

Please also note that I will be out of the office tomorrow, so I will make 
the shortname changes in GCP this evening, after 5:p.  ERMS IT will make its 
changes tomorrow morning, Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001. 

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.
