Credit has them as being an "ESP", which means they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant under the rules of the CFTC.  The CFTC sets financial criteria, 
such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial 
products .  Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but 
Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.

Tana,
Thanks for the approvals.  One question though.  Credit approved American 
Color Graphics for physical transactions only.  However,
your sheet shows them open for financial trading.  Usually, you will close a 
counterparty for financial
if Credit does.
