hello everyone,

Although I was not the original credit person associated with this draft, I 
am the current to date credit person responsible because of Rod's departure.  
The customer is ready to sign the ISDA.  The address to overnight the 
execution copies has not changed.  The contact and collateral threshold 
figure have changed though.

The hardcopy original should be sent to Mandel Selber, 281-537-9920 ext. 
134.  The new dollar amount of the collateral threshold should be $1MM, not 
$500M as was originally sent over within the draft.  I think that is it.

Let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Thanks
brant
