Mr. Kurzer -

Dan Diamond requested that I forward a revised version of the LOI in relation 
to Enron's Broker/Client product.  I have attached below a clean and marked 
version.  The marked version reflects changes from the version of the 
agreement forwarded earlier this week by Tana Jones. 

Please review the attached at your convenience and let me or Dan know if 
there are any questions or concerns.  If not, please sign two originals of 
the clean version and forward a copy via facsimile.  This copy will then be 
signed by Enron.  The originals should be forwarded to my attention under a 
separate cover.  I will ensure that they are countersigned by Enron and one 
fully signed original returned to your attention.
