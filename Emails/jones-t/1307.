 Please be advised that we have installed a dedicated phone line that will 
ring at the offices of all of the paralegals in the Legal Swaps Group, 
regardless of which paralegal is currently handling the confirm desk 
rotation.   From April 1, 2000 through June 30, 2000, I am handling  the 
confirm desk rotation.   In the event that you are unable to reach me at my 
regular extension (3-0975), please dial extension 3-0905 (the "Legal 
Hotline") and one of the other paralegals will assist you.
