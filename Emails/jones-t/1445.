I have moved all Portland docs (the ones that we discussed) to the Portland 
Financial Trading Agreements db.  Check out the database and make sure that I 
got all PGE docs and then we can forward an email to users.

Subject: Master Swap Agreement Database

I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.  The only 
thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated 
out.  What's happening with that?
