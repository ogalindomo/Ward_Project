Cheryl Nelson will be late this morning, and can be expected to be in around 
11 - noon.  She is not feeling well, but expects to feel well enough to come 
to work today.  If you should need assistance, don't hesitate to call.  Thank 
you for your attention to this matter.  Regards, Keegan (5-3317)
