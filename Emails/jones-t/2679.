Access to the Attorney Forms directory (O:\Legal\ATTY.FMS) has been secured 
for "read only" access.  Please contact Erica Braden, Sheri Cromwell, Taffy 
Milligan, Pat Radford or Brenda Whitehead to assist you with:

saving a form to Word 2000  (some forms are losing footers, etc. until saved 
in the 2000 format--this will be done on an "as needed" basis);

replacing a form with an updated version (section head approval required 
before "dropping" the revised document into the directory); or

deleting a form from the directory (section head approval required).

Please call me if you have any questions or concerns.
