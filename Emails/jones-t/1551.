Hi Tana,

I would like to make the Death by Chocolate if no one has taken it yet.  
Since I have two other committments earlier that same day, I can make this 
Friday evening and chill overnight. I have a springform also.  Is one recipe 
enough for the entire group (it serves 10-12)?  
 
Thank you for your directions, we should have no problems.  What time should 
we be at your home?

Thanks,
Nancy
