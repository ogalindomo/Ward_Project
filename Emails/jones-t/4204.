Hello Everyone,

Attached is a name change from Danville State Bank to Chambers Bank.  The 
name has already been overlayed in GCP.  There is also a cosmetic name 
correction from Huish Detergents, Inc. to HUISH detergents, inc.  That change 
too, has already been made to GCP.

Please be reminded that records on the Sep 2000 report will be inactivated 
this afternoon.




Thanks, 
Cheryl x3-3103
