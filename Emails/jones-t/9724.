I had a rush request from Tom Gros - a VP with Net Works (CommodityLogic) - 
wanting an NDA for a meeting later this afternoon.

The counterparty is:

FleetBoston
100 Federal Street
Boston, MA 02110

The subject matter is the "possible acquisition from Enron of a financial 
management module associated with a web-based financial and logistical 
product proprietary to Enron"

This would be a unilateral NDA.

If we could generate this this am, that would be great.

Thanks.
