Thanks so much to each of you for your pledge to help find a cure for breast 
cancer.  Your contributions together with Enron's matching gift total almost 
$2500.  As a breast cancer survivor, as the daughter, granddaughter and niece 
of breast cancer patients, and especially as a mother, I deeply appreciate 
your generosity.

If you have not already given me your contribution, please send me your check 
made payable to Komen Houston Race for the Cure by Thursday, October 12. 

Thanks again.

Teresa
