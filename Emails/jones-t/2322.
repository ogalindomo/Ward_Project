Hi Marie and Tana, 
Believe it or not, you are both right.There is no way any friend is going to 
come between my friends in the Swap team and at EBS and me. I was definitely 
with Kofi. In the bushes, trying to resolve some real trying issues. And the 
two beautiful babes on my arms? My gorgeous friends, Tana and Marie. Wishes, 
wishes,and more wishes. A guy can't get any luckier. I was in Anfoeta Gbogame 
over the weekend, doing my loin cloth thing. I am back in Accra today, and 
will be here until Wednesday. I will then be back in my village for a few 
days to attend my dad's burial. I miss you all. I am looking forward to 
seeing you soon.
