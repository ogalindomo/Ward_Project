Brent Hendry is still ill.  He has a doctor appointment this morning and will 
not be in the office today.


Carol:  Brent said you were the main instructor for today's Credit/Legal 
training session.  If I can help with anything, please let me know.  Snacks 
and extra chairs have already been requested.
