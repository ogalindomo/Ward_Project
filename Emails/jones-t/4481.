Walter, to be able to get a quick turnaround on these counterparty setups, my 
group needs the address and phone number to these counterparties....our 
deadline is 10:00 am today, and with the minimal information on the 
spreadsheet (just CP name) we will not be able to complete setup by deadline 
and cause delays for the global contracts group.....

Please provide the data above asap.....call if you have any 
questions....thanks....

our group...
