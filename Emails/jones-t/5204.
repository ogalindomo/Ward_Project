Leslie: 

We have reviewed the requested changes to the NDA and have approved the 
majority of the requested changes. We have redlined (or in this case 
bluelined) the areas where we would like to either go back to the original 
language or modify your changes. To expedite the review I would like to 
suggest you contact our legal representative Mark Smith and discuss any 
remaining issues. I believe we are very close to agreement on the changes and 
hopefully if you and Mark can talk directly we will be able to finalize the 
NDA. 

Mark can be reached at (512) 651 - 1311 or by email at msmith@sapient.com. I 
look forward to finalizing the NDA and continuing our discussions with Enron. 
Thanks again for your quick response to the NDA. 

Regards, 

Lee Henderson

Dave Samuels asked me to review Sapient's form of NDA that you forwarded to 
him on 11/3.? Attached please find my requested changes to the NDA.? I have 
red-lined my comments against the version you sent Dave. 

I look forward to discussing the revised NDA with you at your earliest 
convenience.? If there are no requested changes, let me know and I will 
have a finalized version executed and sent to you.
