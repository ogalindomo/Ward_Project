I am sorry for not having gotten back to you sooner, but I have been pulled 
onto a couple of projects that have required specific focus over the last 
couple of days.  

I have looked at the provisions of Paragraph 5(b).  We can add the following 
language to the end of the paragraph to address some of your concerns:

"unless such access, entry or action taken or not taken arises from the 
failure of Enron to maintain commercially reasonable security controls for 
the web site or otherwise from the negligence or intentional misconduct of 
Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors"

Please let me know your thoughts.  If this is acceptable, I will work on a 
clean draft showing all final revisions and forward that to you later today 
or tomorrow morning.  If the above is not acceptable I am not sure there is 
anything further that I can propose.

Thanks for your patience.
