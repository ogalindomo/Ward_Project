Join John Tollefsen on eSpeak at ethink.enron.com, Tuesday, April 11 at 10 
a.m. Houston time.  John, with the Global Enron Migration (GEM) project team, 
will discuss Enron's direction for the rollout of Windows 2000.

Are you at a remote location or can't make the event?  Go into eSpeak now and 
pre-submit your question(s) for John to answer during the scheduled event.  
We want to answer everyone's questions, but due to the high volume of 
questions we anticipate on this session, it would be helpful if you can keep 
your questions short and simple.  This will increase the opportunity for your 
question to be answered.
