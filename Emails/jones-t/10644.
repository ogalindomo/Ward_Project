Does anyone know of an assignment of trades from Merrill Lynch Capital 
Services to Allegheny Energy Global Markets?  Michelle Stevens (financial 
settlements) left me a message that Merrill Lynch told her that the trades 
had been assigned.  I do not see anything in Lotus Notes.

Thanks,
Stephanie
