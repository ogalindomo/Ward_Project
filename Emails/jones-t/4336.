Bart Clark and I are Juvenille Diabetes Walk to Cure Diabetes team leaders 
again this year.  The ENA Legal JDF walk team was outstanding last year.  We 
can do even better this year for this very worthy cause.  The Juvenile 
Diabetes Foundation was founded in 1970 by the parents of children with 
diabetes.  Their mission: to find a cure for the disease and its 
complications through the support of research.  JDF is on of the nation's 
most cost-efficient charities, providing at least 80 cents on every dollar to 
research and education about research.  

This year's Walk is Sunday November 5, 2000 at Sam Houston Race Park.  The 
Enron Walk team is one of the biggest and is absolutely the BEST in the 
nation.  Every walker raising $25 and every contributor of at least $25 will 
get an Enron JDF T-shirt.   If you can walk please sign up (the list is at 
Bart's office) as soon as possible.  The walk is always a  wonderful time.  
If you can't walk, EVERY contribution is greatly apprectiated.  Call with any 
questions.
