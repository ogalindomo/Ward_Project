Mike,

How can Brent get access to our Master Swap Agreement database from EI in 
Argentina?  Thanks for your help.

No.  My understanding is that the EI server does not have a link to the ECT 
server or something else like that which prevents access from my computor 
down here.

The question of the day is, do you have access to our Lotus Notes Database?
