Fred has asked that we prepare an ISDA between ENA and Northern Border 
Partners, L.P., which is also a wholly owned Enron subsidiary.  Should we 
prepare an RMA or regular ISDA?  I have provided a worksheet that contains 
Enron's ownership structure and little else.  Let me know if I should provide 
another worksheet with more detail.

thanks
