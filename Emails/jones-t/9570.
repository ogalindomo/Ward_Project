In preparation for the upcoming "end of construction" shuffle--Phase I 
"tentatively" scheduled the 1st week of March, I am inputting departmental  
information into the database and find that I'm missing your badge number.  

The move team has implemented a new system that requires the badge number of 
the employee, rather than social security number.  

Please provide this number to me at your earliest convenience.  This number 
can be found at the top of your badge.


Thank you for your cooperation.

Taffy Milligan



PS.  Mark Taylor will be providing details regarding the shuffle at a later 
date.
