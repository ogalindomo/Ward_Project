Per Tana's e-mail dated June 9, 2000,  I have not receive a fax copy of the 
executed  Confidentiality Agreement from Continental in connection with the 
above-referenced entity.  Unfortunately, I will be in training all day 
tomorrow.  I am requesting that you also forward  a fax copy of the executed 
Confidentiality Agreement to Mark Taylor  for his initials and for signing by 
either Louis Kitchen or Andy Zipper.   

If you have any questions, please contact Mark Taylor at extension 37459.

Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
