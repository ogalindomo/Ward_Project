Yeh , the amazing thing about having a tied Bush/Gore election ( I think 
that's called Hobson's choice) , with one geriatric resort in Florida 
probably deciding which way it finally goes , is that it has actually made me 
think (1) that our dear old UK electoral system isn't so bad and (2) that 
Phony Blair could be a lot worse!!

Congratulations.  It is now official.  The media and trial lawyers officially 
govern the United Staes of America.  (I suppose it could be worse.  You could 
live in the Peoples Republic of Canada, or have some appendage to an armbag 
running the show.)
