Russell,

Stephanie called yesterday and said this counterparty called EOL and wanted 
to get opened to trade financial online and get an ISDA in place.

I spoke to Tom Moran about this counterparty this morning to see if we saw 
them as a swap counterparty before I called them, and Tom told me that he did 
not think Credit wanted to trade financial with this counterparty.  He asked 
me to pass the counterparty's name & number on to you so you could give them 
a call to break the news to them.  The woman who called is named karen and 
her no. is 713/974-9394.
