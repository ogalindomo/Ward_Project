Dr. Ninan Mathew with the Houston Headache Clinic, it's all they do.  My 
father also had headaches, cluster headaches, and he went to a headache 
specialist in New York who recommended Dr. Mathew for me.  His offices are in 
the Medical Center, right off of Bissonnet, near the Museum.  His no. is 
713/528-1916.  Good luck!

Hi Tana, can you forward to me again the name and phone number of your
