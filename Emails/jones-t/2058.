Please prepare DRAFT credit annexes for an omnibus confirm for New England 
Serum Company, Inc.  This is the up-front cushion LC customer that Carol and 
I briefly talked about this morning.  So please feel free to call me with 
questions about the structure of the desired deal.  



And by way of information, I will be in Toronto on Monday to inspect a 
counterparty's financial statements.  Between the actual meeting and the 
flying time, there will only small windows of opportunity to check messages 
and return calls.
