Hello Everyone,

Just wanted to inform you that I am leaving EnronOnline Operations as of June 
1st, 2000.  Please take my name off of your email distribution lists 
effective immediately.  Stephanie Sever will be taking over my 
responsibilities and handling all relevant issues.  I have enjoyed working 
with you all.

Thank you,

Lisa Gillette
