Tana:

Last year Edie Leschber prepared the Legal Consolidation Financial Statements 
and Footnotes for submission to NYMEX.  This year I will be doing that job.  
If you are still handling this, I would like to find out the due date.  If 
you are not, will you please direct me to the appropriate individual?



Thanks
