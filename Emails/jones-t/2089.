Per Tana Jones's e-mail dated June 6, 2000, I should have received a copy of 
the counterparty approval list to distribute in her absence.  Please advise 
at your earliest convenience if a list was distributed on today (6/12/00).   
I will be in training tomorrow.  However, during my lunch hour I will check 
my e-mail for a response from you.

Thanks for your attention to this matter.
