In order to finalize the Windows 2000 Migration, we need to make sure that 
all the Access databases are fully operational.  We need to complete the 
migration of the last 2 desktops on the 38th Floor by Friday, June 9, 2000.  
Please confirm by email if your databases are working properly for you and 
your group (please list the name of the databases).

Thank you for your cooperation.
