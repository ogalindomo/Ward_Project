Rousseau,

We are trying to finalize the approval of the Japanese counterparty list for 
EnronOnline and are in need of your assistance.  The file attached below 
contains the list of credit approved counterparties.  The first section (rows 
8 - 12) consists of counterparties that are already set-up in EnronOnline.  
No action on your part is required.  Section 2 (rows 14 - 92) consists of 
counterparties that have been approved by credit and are currently being 
review by legal and global contracts.  Can you look over this section and 
verify that the names listed are the correct and full legal name of the 
counterparty?  The counterparty names in this section that do not have a 
corresponding CP ID # (column C) next to the name are currently not set-up in 
our global database.  Therefor, we what to ensure these counterparties are 
set-up correctly.  Section 3 (rows 94 - 114) consists of counterparties that 
credit is going to approve, but have been unable to identify the correct and 
full legal counterparty name.  Can you provide this information for us.  As 
the launch date is quickly approaching, it is critical that we receive this 
information as soon as possible.

As mentioned above, the legal and global teams are completing the final 
reviews and creating new records in the global database.  I have given your 
name to several members of these teams.  You may receive request from them 
over the next couple of days to assist them with questions.  I hope that this 
does not create any conflicts for you, but I believe that this may expedite 
this process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for all of your help!!!
