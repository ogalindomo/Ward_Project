		 Subject: Counterparty Approval Lists for 05/05/00. 05/08/00 and 05/09/00

Attached are the referenced lists.

With respect to the list for 5/8/00, Imperial Oil Resources and Pengrowth 
Corporation were on the initial approval lists.  We have a duplicate Global 
Counterparty # open for Imperial.  The second one needs to be shut down.
