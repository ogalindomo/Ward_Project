Subject: Financial Trading Agreement Database

We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the 
"Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit.  
Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access 
so I can email them the agent to open the database.  Much thanks!
