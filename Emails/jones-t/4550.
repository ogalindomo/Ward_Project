Attached is the revised form of Enron Guaranty for your review.  By fax I 
have sent comments to the HQ guaranty.  Please note that our back office has 
verified that no financial trades exist between HQ US and ENA as of this 
date.  Therefore, I propose we use October 18, 2000 as the execution date on 
all documents and opinions.  If HQ US back office shows any outstanding 
trades, please advise.  Mary
