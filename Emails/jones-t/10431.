Tana,

I have just been through the confirms and we have 
i) the currency swap,
ii) the interest rate swap,
iii) and the PPI swap

but we did not receive the commodity swap (fixed for floating UK power 
prices). Please can you send this through/resend.
Thanks
Janine

At the request of Kay Young, I am faxing you the four confirmations for the 
referenced deal.  Please look for them.
