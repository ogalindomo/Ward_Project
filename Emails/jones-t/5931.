Tana,

In the absence of James Allred at B of A, I have a contact name for you there 
who will pass on the docs to the relevant lawyer. I have stressed the urgency 
of processing & getting them signed ASAP, preferably by Friday. Richard Stein 
at B of A has assured me that they will provide a speedy response! If they 
don't respond by late Wednesday pm please let me know.

Richard Stein
Tel: 713 651 4850

Many thanks,

Soma

Sara,

With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the 
contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit 
Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer.

As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & 
she will be sending you a worksheet. 

I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you 
would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia 
contracts.

Please give me a call if you need anything else. 

Man y thanks,  

Soma
