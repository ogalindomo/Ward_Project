  This agreement should be in the name of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
Company.

We want to strike item #2.  The language provides that we will not disclose
the "existence" of the confidentiality agreement.  Normally, we only agree
not to disclose the confidential information.

If these changes are acceptable, we will be ready to arrange a meeting.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me.
