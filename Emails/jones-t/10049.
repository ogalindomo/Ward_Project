As a follow-up to our last Administrative Assistants Meeting, I have attached 
a list of topics being considered for the Brown Bag Tutorials to be presented 
to the ENA Legal Department.  Please indicate on the attached list your 
interest in any of the topics and forward it to me at your earliest 
convenience.  After receipt of the lists, I will prepare a calendar 
indicating when each of the classes will be presented.  These tutorials will 
be presented on a recurring monthly basis depending on interest.  Thanks for 
your cooperation.
