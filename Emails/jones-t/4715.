Thanks for following up -- Utilicorp. was initially set up for Sales only but 
subsequently opened up for Sales and Purchases.  So, they should be open for 
US power.

Tana:

No change to profiles for Utilicorp. United Inc. or Calpine Power Services 
Company -- these entities are authorized to trade US power.

Constellation Energy Source, Inc. is NOT authorized -- restricted by credit.
