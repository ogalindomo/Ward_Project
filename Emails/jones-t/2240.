FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT OF 1999

On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking 
Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and 
individuals designated as "SDNTKs" (Specially Designated Narcotics 
Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and 
interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. 

The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking 
organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, 
Russia, and Thailand.

U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in 
property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any 
transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These 
prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and 
other assets.

Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties 
related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, 
$10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act 
authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.
