Then we pass.... there is no sense going through "yesterdays fire drill" when 
we don't have the necessary "paper" in place in order to execute.  We 
appreciate the interest, next time with a little more forewarning, I'm sure 
Enron will competitively be in the hunt.  Let us know is you'd like us to 
continue working on the necessary contracts for future use.  Thanks, John
