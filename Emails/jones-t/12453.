The changes reflected are generally acceptable.  I cannot, however, agree to 
the changes made in Paragraphs 8 and 11.  In Paragraph 8, the deletion of 
this information from secured back-up systems could only be deleted in 
accordance with any existing policy of our company.  We cannot pick and 
choose what is and is not deleted.  As to Paragraph 11, since this agreement 
is intended to address subjects consistent with the April 6 NDA between our 
companies, it makes little sense to have two agreements in place.  Therefore, 
the language indicating that this agreement supersedes the prior NDA needs to 
be retained.  Whether or not this is also applicable to AETRS is between the 
two of you.

I will be in my office in the morning and look forward to speaking with you 
or your counsel.

Mark,

Here is the NDA that you submitted to me this morning.  Our Legal
department has reviewed all changes and has made some changes, which are
attached (redlined).  Please let me know if these changes are acceptable
and whether it is OK for us to move forward using this version.

Also, John Pavetto, who is visiting us today from Enron is a VP.  Is he
authorized to sign this NDA, or do I still need to send you a copy to
have signed?

Thanks again for your help.
