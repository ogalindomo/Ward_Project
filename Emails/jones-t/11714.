Hi Tana: We have an executed agreement protecting Cargill Steel and Wire, a 
department of Cargill Inc. re possible provision by ENA of risk management 
services to Cargill.  From Rodney Malcolm's group December , 2000 to December 
2001.  I imagine we have confidential information from the steel and wire 
department, but that should not be a problem if your agreement is specific to 
software related information.
