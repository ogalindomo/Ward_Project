The response is supplemental to the response I sent you yesterday for the 3/8 
list.  In addition to my comments yesterday, neither CIG Merchant Company nor 
Equilon Pipeline Company, LLC is authorized to trade US power products.  
Neither CP is a current trading partner and neither CP is on the FERC lists 
of authorized power marketers.  The other CPs that were restricted by credit 
should also be restricted by legal.
