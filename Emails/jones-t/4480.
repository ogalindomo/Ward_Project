The metals contracts are predominantly managed out of London as London is the 
P/L centre for that business. We are putting together some contracts, but 
they are for structured transactions and whilst I would hope that we would 
place them online at some time in the future, that is some way off. Justin 
Boyd should be listed as the point of contact for metals online contracts.
 
You might want to call the section "Global Markets" rather than "Emerging 
Markets" to reflect the business changes.
