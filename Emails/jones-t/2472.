Have checked with the Physical side of the business - MGMCC - they do not 
have any Master Agreements in place.

I think there may be a few agreements on the Financial side but our 
understanding was that these were one-off agreements for long-term, 
structured deals.  Am trying to follow up with MG and will revert with any 
findings.

Regards,
Lara

Tana,  To date we do not know how many (if any) financial masters MG has in 
place.  We'll check it out at this end and let you know when we have further 
details.  Thanks, Edmund

Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in 
place?  When can we receive copies?
