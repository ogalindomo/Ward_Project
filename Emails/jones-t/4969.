As you know, we are continuously updating the Foreign & Domestic Counsel 
database so that it can be maintained in the most accurate form; therefore, 
any new information you may have regarding outside counsel firms that have 
been interviewed and/or retained in the past 12 months would be greatly 
appreciated.  Also, if you have any updates to the existing database entries 
we would also like to hear from you. 

Please take the time to help us update this database so it can be a valuable 
tool for all of us!  Each one of us has full access to the database via your 
Lotus Notes application; however, if you icon has disappeared from your 
desktop, click here to add back on to your desktop >>>>>

Please provide any new information and/or updates either to Nony Flores or 
Becky Spencer. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
