As per my VM - Rhonda says that she cannot see any off-line trades w/ them. 
Can you get the CP to clarify a) in what name they think they are trading w/ 
us and b) list some current deals. 

We can then research this further.

Thanks

Shari,

I've got them shut down for power.  They were one of the counterparty's on 
the initial approval lists.  The online team tells me we are trading power 
with them off line, so what's the scoop?  Can they trade power?
