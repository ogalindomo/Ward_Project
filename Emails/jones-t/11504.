  I am not sure what kind of paper on the confirmation was sent to them or 
what they executed.  Was the confirm subject to the master?  I will have Tana 
forward you what we had last sent them in February.  After you receive it, 
give me a call.


Cordially,

Mary, we have received an executed copy of the Lakeside financial confirm, 
which has been confirmed pursuant to the standard 1992 form of ISDA.  
However, they also executed and returned the execution page of an ISDA base 
contract.  Since I didn't send them any documents, I assume it came from the 
documents you provided to them.  Could you do me a favour and forward to me 
the package of ISDA documents (ie. base contract, schedule, credit support 
annex, etc.).  Please do not contact the counterparty.

Thanks
Greg
