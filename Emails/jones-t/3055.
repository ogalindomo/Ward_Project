Dear Tana,

Millions of people enjoy them every month, people tell us everyday 
how helpful they are, and now we're happy to be able to offer them to 
you too. It's the Real Deals and The Insider newsletters and we 
thought they might be something you'd enjoy too! These two 
electronic newsletters are now available, free, to 
Travelocity.com members. 

Real Deals is delivered to your inbox twice each month and is full of 
great travel information, special fares, and other travel deals to 
help you go farther on your travel budget. You'll want to look here 
before planning your next trip to take advantage of the 
terrific deals! 

The Insider is packed with insights and stories on popular seasonal 
travel destinations. This monthly newsletter arms you with "insider" 
insight to help you plan your next getaway or vacation. Get "inside" 
our featured destinations. 

You'll receive the August issues at TANA.JONES@enron.com and we hope 
you like what you'll see. If The Insider or Real Deals isn't for 
you, you can always unsubscribe or change your e-mail preferences 
through the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the newsletter or by 
clicking below:

We're thrilled to offer such valuable and helpful newsletters free of 
charge. We hope you'll check them out and let us know what 
you think! 


Sincerely, 

The Travelocity.com Team
