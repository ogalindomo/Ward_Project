Tana, the only comment I have is that the term "Confirmation" in paragraph 2 
should be "Confirmation Letter" as that is the defined term under our 
master.  Otherwise, it looks fine.  If you want to send it to me to get it 
executed, I will need to initial it before Jon McKay will execute it in any 
event.

Thanks

Would you like to sign off on this form of assignment since I am going to 
have to send it up to Canada for signature.  Much thanks!
