Tana, as a follow-up to our discussion on laws of foreign countries, I have 
prepared a list of countries I think we should look into.  I believe our 
London office  has already (or is in the process of) surveying all the 
European jurisdictions on this; Jonathan Marsh will confirm this for me.

Do you have any suggestions as to how we can check on the non-European 
jurisdictions on the list below -- i.e. is there some procedure we normally 
go through on this?  or should I just call David Minns for Asia, Peter 
Keohane for Canada, etc.?  your input is appreciated
