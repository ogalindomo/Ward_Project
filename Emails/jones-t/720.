Tana,

No one here is working on revised confirms for BC Gas Utility.  All deals 
prior to the execution of the Master are signed by BC Gas.  Do they want 
these regenerated to show the Master Agreement template?

Thanks,
Joe

Can whoever is working on the revised confirms for the referenced 
counterparty let Doug know the status?  Thanks!

My friends at BC Gas now have the ISDA amendment.  Thanks.  What about the 
revised confirms?
