Subject: EOL Master Matrix -- SPECIAL AUDIT

We received a new EOL Master Matrix last night and it is available in our 
subdirectory as well as the common drive drop box.  

We are requesting a SPECIAL AUDIT of CP ID #86441 (EnergyUSA-TPC Corp.) per 
the situation outlined below.  Please let me know as soon as possible whether 
the contract information contained in the EOL Master Matrix is correct for 
this counterparty. 

Thank you,
Karen

Legal is requesting copies of the contract and confirm for an EOL deal where 
the counterparty (Energy USA-TPC Corp.) defaulted.   The trader requested the 
EOL deal number and additional specific information.

Legal:  Stacey Dickson
Trader:  Maureen Smith

Please also provide the information to me so that I can determine whether 
they need copies of a Master contract and, if so, which one.

Thanks,
Karen
