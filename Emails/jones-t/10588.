I need two non-disclosure agreements before sharing our DocuLogic functional 
requirements document with an external consulting company with expertise in 
building document management systems.  Can you make these for me, or should I 
approach IT's contracts department?

Last time I had them made, Enron required (1) official name of company, (2) 
state of incorporation, (3) principal address of business, (4) name/title of 
their authorized signatory.  Is this still the case?
