We just got the executed ISDA Master and guaranty in with the referenced 
counterparty, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (you may have noticed my email).  
The Counterparty wants to trade with us online immediately.  Can we get them 
on as an amended counterparty on Monday's list, and can we get them opened to 
trade financial on Monday?
