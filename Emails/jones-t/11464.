I have discussed the timing for correction publication issue with our trading 
desk.  Most price source publications for paper and pulp products are 
published only on a monthly basis and therefore the 40 days is needed in 
order to utilize the correction concept, which we do want to be able to 
utilize.  Thus, we are not in agreement with your proposed amendment.  Please 
call if you would like to discuss.


Cordially,
