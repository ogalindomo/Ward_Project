Samantha will not be returning for an additional and yet undetermined number 
of weeks.  In light of this, I reviewed the matters remaining in her office 
and have distributed them to a number of you for further review and handling 
in accordance with assigned files and areas.  If you have any questions about 
any of those matters, please stop by.  Further, with respect to other files 
for which Samantha remains the assigned paralegal pursuant to the trading 
data base, any attorney needing paralegal support during the course of work 
on the file should please see me to coordinate reassignments to other 
paralegals.  Thank you all.


Cordially,
