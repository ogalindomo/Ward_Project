The only comment I would make is that the scope of the Agreement sees 
unecessarily broad - it doesn't identify a specific proposed transaction and 
therefore concievably any info. exchanged between the parties will be subject 
to a Confi. obligation.  As a practical matter this will probably benefit us 
rather than them in view of PWCs position  - I assume they are acting as 
consultatnts ?

Mark can you give me a call to discuss.

tks,

Denis

At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am forwarding to you the proposed 
Non-Disclosure Agreement between Pricewaterhouse (for CreditDimensions) and 
Enron Credit Limited.  Mark Greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made 
a few changes to Pricewaterhouse's form.  If you have any questions about the

Sage in London to execute this agreement.
