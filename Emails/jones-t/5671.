I will negotiate the NDA for David's group.  The counterparty had several 
comments to the NDA that David sent out yesterday, so I will need to respond 
to those in order to finalize the document.

Denis has drafted the MOU, and I will leave it to him to finalize that 
document after he has addressed any issues raised by the counterparty with 
regard to the MOU.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

David,
Denis told me yesterday that the same lawyer needs to do NDA and MOU (the NDA 
is an extension of the MOU) and that Leslie was looking at the NDA so should 
do the MOU as well.
I suggest that you give Denis a call to clarify.
Leslie should mail Denis (and copy me) with the final documents saying they 
are OK, Denis will initial them, and I will get them signed and send them 
wherever they are required.

I'll publish a general procedures guide later so everything works smoothly 
going forward!

Regards,
Richard

Subject: Erisk MOU and NDA

How is this going?

There is an appendix A under Section E of the MOU which is 
a non-disclosure agreement.

We are working on this NDA with Tana Jones of ENA Legal.

Cheers,
David
