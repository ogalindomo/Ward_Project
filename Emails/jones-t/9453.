Subject: Lafarge Canada Credit Worksheet

Please find attached the credit worksheet for the preparation of an ISDA with 
Lafarge Canada Inc.  Please also be advised that we will be exchanging 
guarantees with the counterparty and therefore will need to prepare a draft 
guaranty for their review as well. 


Thanks so much for all your help!
Wendy
