Tana and I will be working on an ISDA for financial derivs with a US trading 
affiliate of Hydro Quebec (which I understand to be a provincial utility) 
wherein HQ will be a guarantor.  Because this raises a number of issues we 
will need Quebec counsel.  Please advise of some good choices.  Thank you.
