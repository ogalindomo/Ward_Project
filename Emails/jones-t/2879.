Tana,

We met with Scott  Clark the Assistant Managing Editor of the Houston 
Chronicle this week and discussed the possibility of putting some EnronOnline 
pricing in the Houston Chronicle.

In order to assist Scott in his evaluation of the concept we are going to 
release certain confidential details with regard to our trading operations, 
please could you have a confidentiality agreement with regard to this 
information put in place as long as Scott is happy with putting something in 
place.

Regards

Louise
