Tana,
Just wanted to keep you in the loop.  I would be interested in your thoughts 
on the separate passwords.
Regards,
Doug

Subject: Alliant Agency Relationship

Doug - 

As discussed, at the absolute minimum,  we need the following from Alliant in 
order to do EOL trades as well as longer dated OTC trades: 

1. Written evidence that Steve Castleburg is an authorized signatory for each 
of the 3 utilities (and AECS - see below). 
2. In addition, I would like for Alliant Energy Corporate Services to sign 
the Consent and Acknowledgment letter as well. I am not sure why a signature 
space was not provided for them on the document. Anyway - it is on our system 
and easy to generate a revised letter with a signature space for AECS. 

Also, as discussed, in order for us to give Alliant the best credit line 
possible, here is our wish list, from most desirable downwards. What this 
means is that if Alliant is willing to do #1- then they will get the best 
line possible. If they do #2, then the line will be somewhat decreased, and 
so on.   

1. Separate EOL applications and passwords for each individual utility who is 
appointing Alliant as agent (i.e. a total of 3 individual passwords). Also a 
separate Consent and Acknowledgment for each will need to be signed by AECS 
and the relevant utility. 

2. Alliant identifies at the time of transacting which utility the 
transaction is for. 

3. Alliant sends us an allocation schedule at the end of each month which 
shows which transaction is for which utility.      

This is the procedure we follow with all utility agency relationships - we 
are not singling out Alliant - I can promise you that., 

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks, 

Shari
