Please find attached a copy of the 250MWh/year or less and the more than 
250MWh/year forms of retail electricity contract.  

I will be out of the office at a course for most of the day tomorrow and at 
least until noon on Friday.  As a result, I may be difficult to reach.   I 
will be checking my messages periodically and will carry my cell phone.

Shawn and Jason, please be advised that I have faxed a copy of a mark-up for 
Co-op to Linda Sietzema to prepare.  Peter has agreed to proof my changes. 

Adios.

Mark
