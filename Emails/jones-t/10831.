Richard -

Thanks so much for providing the below document.  While I appreciate its
simplicity, it does not fully satisfy Enron's requirements.  If it is not
too much trouble, could you or Kenneth please provide comments to the
agreement provided.

I will be back in my office on Wednesday and can address matters directly
with Kenneth or you at that time.
