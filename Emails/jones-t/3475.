John, no we do not have an ISDA in place with Wah Chang.  Do you want me to 
pass your request on to Credit?

I don't believe we do, John. But you should check with Tana Jones in 
Houston.  She handles ISDAs.

Jan, do we have an ISDA with Wah Chang ??  They are owned by Allegheny 
Technologies.

Tracy, can you start looking at their credit/financials for me ??


Thanks,   John
