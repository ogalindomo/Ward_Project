Hi Tana,

For our ISDA with the above referenced counterparty, can you tell me
if we (ENA) are supposed to be the confirming party or is it Soc Gen?

They've been sending us a lot of their confirms lately (in the Emerging
Products world, that is....Weather transactions) and are expecting us
to sign their confirms.   I'd like to confirm that our ISDA says We confirm
before I go back to them.

Thanks,
Diane
