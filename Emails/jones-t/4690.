As most everyone knows, credit was out of the office last Thursday and 
Friday.  On Weds., we approved this trade, but with added credit language.  
But, in all the confusion, it was confirmed without the intended language.  
Could we please prepare rescendance language and perhaps include such with 
credit language to be prepared from terms of the attached credit worksheet.

thanks
