Tana,
?
Hope you had a good weekend.? I missed your breakfast  call, so I figured you 
had other plans.? 
?
I did e-mail Gretchen on Friday and she sent back 2 different  responses:? 
??? "The job is still  open."???? &???? "I did receive your  resume."
?
And, yesterday I received a blanket letter from Enron thanking  me for my 
interest, etc., etc., etc.
?
I know you said things move slowly around there.? What  suggestions do you 
have at this point as to pursuing an  interview???
?
Any good news on your new house and/or your present  one?
?
