NOT YET EFFECTIVE   ---- BUT FYI

 We have Master Agreements in place with each of these entities.   We have 
sent to ONEOK a Transfer and Termination Agreement under which  the following 
will occur once it becomes effective.

1. Oneok II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master 
Agreement to Oneok L.P.

2. The ONEOK LP Master Agreement will be terminated and all trades will be 
done under the ONEOK II Master Agreement.


In summary, once the Transfer and Termination Agreement becomes effective, 
all trades will be done with ONEOK LP under the ONEOK II Master Agreement 
that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes from the parent ONEOK Inc.    
We will let you know when this becomes effective.
