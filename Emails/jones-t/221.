The address in Paris is the central address from their invoices.  Toulouse is 
a regional office when we find some of the meteroologists are based.
So contractually I think Paris is porbably the best reference.
Hope this helps

Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the 
list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at 
the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France 
where we used their Toulouse address.  I just wanted to confirm that the 
address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of 
Paris, not Toulouse.  If you'll just confirm that for me.
