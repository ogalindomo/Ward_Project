Bob,

Further to our conversation this morning, the meeting with GSX is confirmed 
for Tuesday April 17th at noon.  I have contacted GSX to inform them that the 
Confidentiality Agreement is being prepared and will be forwarded shortly.  
Their request is to email it to Errol Benjenk at the details below:
