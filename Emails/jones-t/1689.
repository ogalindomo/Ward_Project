 David  --- I gave this doc to Tana Jones (for Eonline trading).  It also 
referred to physical deals, so she was going to pass it on to Debra 
Perkingiere.   Call Tana - she can tell you where it is at.   Thanks!     (it 
did not effect financial trading).

Could I have a copy of the assignment which I sent to you via interoffice 
mail the other day for
PPL Utilities?? I would be interested in picking this up from you if possible.

Thanks
David
