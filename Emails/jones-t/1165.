Hi Tana,

I need to know where crude/liquids financial trades for  Valero should be 
traded under.    I was reading the comments on Lotus Notes, and it seems that 
there was an assignment from Valero Gas Marketing L.P. to Valero Marketing & 
Supply Company;  then it seems that the natural gas financial  trades were 
assigned to PG&E.   Can you please check on this.  If the information on 
Lotus Notes is correct please change the "Executed Master Agreeements" list 
to read Valero Marketing & Supply Company (for crude/liquids trades).  
Currently the list reads Valero Gas Marketing L.P.

Thanks for your assistance,

Nidia
