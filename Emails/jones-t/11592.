Tana:
Here is the draft of the letter to be given to the participants of the 
training sessions for ConfirmLogic.  If you could review this for content to 
make sure that I've covered the purpose that Tom Gros asked for which was to 
emphasize that what is done in CL will not have any legal consequence and 
that the confirmation process will remain intact during the beta period.

I've got our first user training tomorrow at 3pm


Thanks,
KC
