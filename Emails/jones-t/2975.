Back Office does not match Global Counterparty database
EOL Back office lists an active counterparty:

 CP ID 294 Jefferson Smurfit Corporation

However, the Global Counterparty database lists, for the same CP ID:

 CP ID 294 SMURFIT CARTON Y PAPEL DE MEXICO, S.A. DE C.V.

Does back office have an incorrect CP ID or CP name for this counterparty?


New Master Financial Contract Received
Global received a new master financial contract with "Jefferson Smurfit Corp. 
(U.S.)" .
The Global Counterparty database lists 2 separate counterparties:

 CP ID 121 Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.)

Can you help us determine exactly which counterparty is conducting online 
trading ?
