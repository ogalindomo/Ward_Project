The Global Contracts Group (ENA) no longer has a clerk and will no longer be 
picking up contracts.  Please have the ENA contracts delivered to Julissa 
Marron (EB3761).  The HPL contracts need to be delivered to Steve Venturatos' 
group located on the 21st floor (EB2191).  Please see Anthony's note below.
