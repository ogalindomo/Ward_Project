In preparation for the Windows 2000 roll out, a representative from IT will 
be coming by on Thursday to look at the applications you are using on your 
computer.  As many of us utilize different databases and software, we would 
like to get an accurate account of your PC in order to provide a smooth 
transition. 

Please take a moment to visit with the IT representative and provide the 
necessary information. Thank you!
