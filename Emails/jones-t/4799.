Thanks

I'm sorry for the delay.  I looked at the agreement and I have no problem 
with it although, as a lawyer, it is dificult to envision how the English 
courts are going to apply Texas law.  I would like to know what this is about 
as I have no idea.  Can you please give me a call on 34916?  Thanks.
