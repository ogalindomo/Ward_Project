For buying and selling physical power we usually like to see some physical 
presence in the market in which a counterparty is buying and/or selling. 
Since we do not have Canadian physical power products available, I need to 
understand more about the counterparty to open them at all on EOL for 
physical power transactions.
 
Just to confirm that since they have not demonstrated that they have a Power 
Marketer's Licence, if they were to be opened they can only be open for buy 
transactions and cannot sell.
