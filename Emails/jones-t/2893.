		 Subject: Vacation Request - 

Please be advised, I am planning to take the week of Vacation, 8/7-11/2000, 
unless this creates a conflict within the group.

I will notify, Brenda Whitehead so she can arrange coverage for my desk, as 
soon as I receive your approval.

Thank you for your consideration.

Taffy
