Attached for Natsource's signing are the final versions of the BETA and Fee 
Agreement.  One you have confirmed these are acceptable, please have an 
authorized rep. sign two originals of each document, have a copy of  each 
agreement faxed to my attention or to Tana Jones (for countersignature by 
Enron) and have both sets of originals forwarded to me or Tana Jones for 
countersignature by Enron.

I will ensure that one set of originals are returned to your attention.

Also, please be sure to forward the revised letter of credit reflecting that 
it stands for both Natsource and Natsource Tullett Europe as we cannot issue 
a password or allow access until this agreement is received.  Further, please 
ensure that payment of the fee is made.  If wiring instructions are needed, I 
will be happy to obtain them for you and forward for your use.

Thanks.  Please let me know if there is anything further that you should need.
