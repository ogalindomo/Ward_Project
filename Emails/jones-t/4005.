I have just received documentation to support the name change for the 
following entity, and we have been requested by Credit to overlay the name in 
GCP immediately.  This is to put all interested parties on notice that any 
objections or concerns regarding these changes should be directed to me at 
X3-3103 or Marilyn Colbert at X3-6517.  This change will appear as an 
addition to the final name change/merger report due out next week.
