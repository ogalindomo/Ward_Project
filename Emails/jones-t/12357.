Tana & Ed,

If I could get this information by tomorrow it would be greatly appreciated. 
Mid market is visiting this customer at the end of the week and would like to 
have this information.

Thanks ...

Tana & Ed,

Ontario Power Generation would like to start trading US East Power 
Financials.  
They are in a position to do a large amount of business at this time, 
therefore, your immediate attention would be appreciated.

Thank you both for your assistance.  Looking forward to hearing from you.
