Subject: ENRON TO CONNECT Enron Online TO TRUE QUOTE


Louise -

I invite you to partner with BrentBroker.com to allow the dissemination of
EOL crude & refined product quotes onto our platform. At the moment, it
looks as if we are supporting markets that won't compete directly with those
announced for True Quote. We are going live within the next week or so and
are narrowly focused on the crude physical, crude derivative and refined
product derivative markets (we have received our CFTC no-action relief). You
may have heard, we are also commission free. Your participation in
BrentBroker would be welcomed.

Regards,

Peter V. Groetzinger, COO
