Hello Tana,
Please disregard previous email regarding Southern Company Services as it has 
already been approved by legal.  Our access database reflected the incorrect 
status of legal reviewing and should have been Requested More Info. from 
Customer.  I talked to the customer and she faxed me the new PA this morning 
& I will process and email her ID and password today.  I apologize for any 
confusion that this may have caused.
 
Thank you ,
Claudia x3-9281
