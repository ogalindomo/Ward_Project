Subject: Peabody Coal Sales

Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial 
payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the 
business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down 
immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline 
and online, until this payment dispute is resolved.
