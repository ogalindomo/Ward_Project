Thank you for the phone call. I have spoken with Curtis Smith; and it seems 
the Limits Contract Report has likely been reflecting the wrong positions for 
quite some time. I apologize for this problem--as I was unaware. I will 
remain in contact with you, Curtis and Mark in the next few days as we work 
to find a more efficient and reliable way of reporting our positions. Please 
do not hesitate to contact me with any questions, concerns or (ideally) 
solutions.

Regards.
Tobin
