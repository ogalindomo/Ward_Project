A Microsoft Outlook delivery problem with certain users may have occurred 
yesterday when the day's EOL approvals were sent.  If you did NOT receive 
yesterday's approval spreadsheet, please let me know and I'll re-send.  These 
approvals are also available on the credit common drive at 
O:\credit\online\approvals\2001-04\EOL 04-11-01.  Thanks.

Walter
