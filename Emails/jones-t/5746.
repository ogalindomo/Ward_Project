Ms. Tana,
?
Have I got an exciting invitation for you:? Williams  Collection is having a 
holiday get-together on Friday evening, 5-8, you may have  received an 
invitation.?? I bought a coffee table, end table, and  bedside table (for 
Sarah) this past weekend and there is a bed there that I want  and would love 
to have your opinion.? I don't remember if you still work  out on Friday 
evenings, but if you are free and care to join me, I would love to  have your 
company.? Can you pass up this opportunity?? 
?
Actually, I would love for you to go with me, but, also, I  would like to 
know your opinion of a carved pine head/foot board?? I like  it, but I also 
like the iron beds.? I can't decide.
?
Let me know what you are up to and if you are  available.
?
Patti
