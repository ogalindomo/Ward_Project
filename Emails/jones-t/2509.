Narsimha,

The NYMEX may require the aggregation of employees trading with the trades of 
the Company.  Further, Enron Company Policy prohibits employees from trading 
any commodities products that the company trades.  Therefore, in the future, 
please do not trade any products the company trades.  If you have any 
questions as to a specific product, please call me at x33399.
