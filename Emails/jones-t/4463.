Rex:

It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday.  As you requested, I would suggest 
the following as your first line of contact for legal matters:

Leslie Hansen (*36121) Non-Disclosure Agreements or Letters of Intent/MOUs
Tana Jones (*33399) Same -- Please copy Tana on any e-mails sent to me.  Tana 
does a wonderful job managing projects in the pipeline. 
Anne Koehler (*33448) Matters relating to potential equity investments and 
other structured relationships
Travis McCullough (*31575) Anne's back-up if she is not available

If in doubt, feel free to call me, and I can track down the appropriate 
contact for you.

I have spoken with Mike Haney re the Confidentiality Agreements.

Regards,

Leslie
