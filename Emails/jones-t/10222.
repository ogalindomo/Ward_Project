Hi Karen,

I'm in agreement with Tana's message below. I understand that the Trader / 
Requester
applied to EOL as International Paper Corporation, however, after further 
investigation, 
DnB supports that the location of this company is actually a Branch location 
of International Paper Company, CP/ID 1836 - - already an EOL counterparty.

Please confirm and advise.

Please contact Bernice Rodriguez if an inactivation of this Branch record is 
in order.



Bernice, if an inactivation occurs, would you adjust the spreadsheet above on 
the O: drive
and resend it to our EOL distribution as an EOL 03-07-01 Amendment.

Thanks !!

The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty 
on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was 
ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the 
scoop?

Thanks for your help!
