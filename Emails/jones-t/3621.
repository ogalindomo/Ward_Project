Tana / Paul,

 I am trying to check whether or not ECTRIC (US entity) has an ISDA agreement 
in place with Credit Lyonnais and Toronto Dominion (TD) (or Master Swap 
Agreement). 
Justin Boyd from Legal gave me your names as a starting point. We are 
currently negotiating a prepay transaction with Credit Lyonnais and TD and I 
need this information quite urgently 

Could you let me know if you are the right people to ask to?

Thank you for your assistance

Kind regards

Philippe Penet
