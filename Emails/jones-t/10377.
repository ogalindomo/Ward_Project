Mark Taylor, the lawyer who would review all new product descriptions for 
financial products is on vacation and will not be back until Tuesday.  I hope 
this can wait until then...

		 Subject: Clickpaper Financial Descriptions

Please review the Financial Swap descriptions on the attached word document 
for the Clickpaper products.  The two descriptions in red text are existing 
product types in Enron Online.  In each other description, the text you see 
in blue is the only portion that changes in the product type description from 
commodity to commodity.  As the product types are created in the Enron Online 
Production database, your approval will be requested.  The purpose of this 
email is to provide you with advance notice so the approval process can be 
executed quickly.  Please contact me with questions or concerns.

Thank you.
