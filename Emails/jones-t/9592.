It is a good hotel right next to the office.

Greg and I will call you late this week to work an agenda for the trip which 
we can then run by the legal assistants and the documentation people in Peggy 
Hedstrom's group.  The emphasis will need to be on transactional 
documentation and how that rolls into the ISDA - concepts, defined terms, 
forms, etc.

I've got confirmation of the following non-refundable plane fare:  leave 
Houston Tuesday, March 13, arrive Calgary 5:10 pm, returning Sunday March 18 
at 8:05 am.  Staying at the Sheraton Suite at 255 Barclay Parade SW.  Is that 
a good hotel?
