Please send Mark Greenberg a hard copy of the DynegyDirect ETAs with 
addendums that I negotiated for ENA and EPMI.

Mark:

Please note that when negotiating an ETA for EPMI or Enron Gas Liquids, for 
instance, unless the passwords can be restricted to physical products only, 
it is necessary to include language like the language I included in the EPMI 
addendum to make clear that notwithstanding the fact that an EPMI password, 
for instance, is used to enter into a financial power transaction, the Enron 
entity that is a party to the agreement is ENA and the transaction is 
governed by the financial derivatives agreement between Dynegy and ENA.
