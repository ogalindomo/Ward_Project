Hi Tana,

I have left you a voicemail regarding this matter, but I thought I would 
expand on what I require.

Enron Singapore branch did a trade with Unocal International Trading Company 
(Singapore) on EOL.

I want to know if the American entity (Union Oil Company California) has a 
Master Agreement / ISDA Agreement with Enron London / Singapore on a 
Financial stage.

If they do please could you forward a copy of the agreement, otherwise please 
could you call me to discuss the matter further.

Thank you for your help.

Ricky
