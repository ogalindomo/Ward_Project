Bob,

In order to be able to draft the Aquila assignments below, I am going to need 
the contract list which shows the contracts the  trades were originally under 
and which contract they will be under when we assign them.   Can you for that 
list to me ASAP so I can get started drafting the assignments.  It make take 
some time.  Thanks!
