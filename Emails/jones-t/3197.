I should have realized Anthony was bucking for the Chairman's Award!  If I 
had known that...!!!

Hey, my vote's in!  As soon as I was aware of the voting, I dropped what I 
was doing and cast my vote for the most deserving person, Anthony 
Campos-----I mean, Tana Jones.

I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, 
I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).  With such an increase 
in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!

The White House may become an option...
