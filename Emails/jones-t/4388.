* NOTE:  I don't want the same CP doing power deals in 2 differeent names.  
Frank's group needs to confirm that they want to do power deals in the

Frank,

I want this CP to reapply for the password in the following name: Tri-State 
Generation and Transmission Association, Inc, through its Tri-State Power 
Marketing division.  Have them call me if they have issues with this.  While 
you are talking to them, confirm that they want to trade West power only.
