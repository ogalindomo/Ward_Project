Body Shop Members:
On Saturday, June 10th, portions of the Body Shop will be closed for 
approximately 90 days to build the pillar supports for the Enron Center Sky 
Bridge.  This construction will necessitate the closure/relocation of Studio 
B, the free weight area and massage therapy services.  

Many of the Yoga, Tai Chi, and Abs Lab classes previously held in Studio B 
will be moved to Studio A.  Because of space constraints the free weight area 
will be relocated to the Massage Therapy room and Massage Therapy services 
will be transferred to the Health Center on the 3rd floor of the Enron 
building for the duration of the construction project.  

A new class schedule is attached for your convenience.  

Thank you for your patience and understanding during this inconvenient yet 
necessary construction project.
