Tana,

 Can you please forward to me a copy of this assignment?  If not, would you 
please forward this to the correct person or let me know who to contact.

Thanks,

Lesli

Subject: Valero

Valero Gas Marketing LP assigned its master swap contract to Valero Marketing 
& Supply before its merger with PG&E according to legal.  CAS does not 
reflect the assignment - it shows that the master is still with Valero Gas 
Marketing which is now PG&E Texas VGM.  Can you get a copy of the assignment 
from Tana Jones and get the master moved within credit aggregation (the 
trades are in the right place)?

Thanks,
Tanya
