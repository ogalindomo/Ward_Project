Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent to 
him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a confidentiality 
agreement which  contains substantive provisions that have already been 
reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many of the provisions are 
very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please have your counsel review 
that document as  soon as possible.
