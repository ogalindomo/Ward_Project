Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,
       Jason
