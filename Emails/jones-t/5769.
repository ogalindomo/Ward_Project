I talked earlier to Robert Harris, counsel at Credit2B in New York.

He forwarded our NDA to his outside counsel several days ago and placed a 
phone
call to them today in order to follow-up.

Robert is aware of our meeting next week on Dec. 13 and that we need to move 
forward on
this quickly.

Please let me know if you have any further questions about this.  I will 
follow-up with
Robert tomorrow. 

Thanks
