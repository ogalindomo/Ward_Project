Tana,

Per our telephone conversation, please provide myself and Donna Lowry access 
to the Financial SWAPs lotus notes database.  As I indicated during our 
conversation both myself and Donna Lowry work in the RAC group and need the 
same access as the Credit group, in particular Tanya Rohauer.

Other individuals within our group will need access eventually and I will 
send you a separate e-mail at that time.

If I have any questions once I'm in the database, I will call you.

Thanks for your help.

Shemeika Landry
