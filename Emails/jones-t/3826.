		 Subject: EOL Financial Power Trading Approvals

Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her 
request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial 
power products online.  Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need 
to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).

Call me if you have any questions about specific counterparties.
