This note is to acknowledge that both of the Peabody entities that currently 
trade on EOL (Peabody CoalSales and Peabody COALTRADE, Inc.) have been taken 
down to zero threshold for all products.  In addition, they will no longer 
have viewing rights either until this dispute is resolved.  Thanks.

Walter

Subject: Peabody Coal Sales

Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial 
payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the 
business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down 
immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline 
and online, until this payment dispute is resolved.
