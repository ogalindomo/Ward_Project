Frank, I have attached the spreadsheet you forwarded me, and have included 
the Enron TAGG#'s that match the referenced transactions.  In addition, I 
have listed a few other TAGG#'s entered into between ECC and Fletcher that 
are not listed on the spreadsheet.  This encompasses all the transactions we 
have with Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited.

Thanks
Russell
