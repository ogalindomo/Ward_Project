Tana,

  If I understand the enclosed e-mail correctly, a license is only required 
if they resell the bandwidth.  If its for internal use, there is no licensing 
requirement.  The agreement includes reps that the parties have all necessary 
licenses.  Accordingly, I do not think you need to freeze Japanese Cos. from 
bandwidth.

  Cynthia and Michelle  -   please let Tana know if you have a different view 
or are able to provide additional information.  Thanks
