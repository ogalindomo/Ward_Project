Per research at HQUS, and further research here, it is noted that there are 
several outstanding financial trades.  The earliest trade date is 9/11/2000.  
Therefore, Helene and I agreed to date ISDA and Guaranties effective as of 
September 1, 2000, and to reference the fact that prior derivatives have been 
entered into.  See attached revised Enron Guaranty reflecting these matters.

Attached is the revised form of Enron Guaranty for your review.  By fax I 
have sent comments to the HQ guaranty.  Please note that our back office has 
verified that no financial trades exist between HQ US and ENA as of this 
date.  Therefore, I propose we use October 18, 2000 as the execution date on 
all documents and opinions.  If HQ US back office shows any outstanding 
trades, please advise.  Mary
