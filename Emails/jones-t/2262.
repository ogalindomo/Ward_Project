If you could send me the Annex, Paragraph 13 and the pro forma schedule.  
Since we do not yet know what shape the actual entity that we will be 
contracting will take (it is unlikely that we will contract directly with the 
munis but instead through some corporate entity), I think we do not need the 
special municipal provisions right now, although, if its not a bunch of work, 
maybe we should get the form with and without, so I have a draft of both, 
depending on which one we need.

How's the new pad?  Is the garden spectacular yet?  No hiccups in the 
closings or moves, I hope.

Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, 
or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect 
that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form 
that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg
