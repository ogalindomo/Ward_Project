Susan, Tana,

Could you please let Dee Travella at FUNB know the status of the Master 
Agreement between ENA or ECTRC and FUNB. She has today received a schedule 
for a Master Agreement between FUNB and Enron Credit.com. However, the credit 
default swap traded with FUNB was done through ENA.

 I should be grateful for your assistance in this regard.

Many thanks,
Elaine Bannerman-Sowah
