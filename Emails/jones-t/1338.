 Please be advised that I am having a problem sending emails to Bruce Mills, 
Gordon Heaney, Kevin Meredith, Derek Bailey and Souad Mahmassani.   All of 
these people are listed in the Enron Corp. email directory, as opposed to the 
ECT/ENA directory.   While I am using the Enron Corp. address for delivery, 
the system tells me that are not in the directory.   Therefore, these people 
are being left off of the emails that announce executed masters.
