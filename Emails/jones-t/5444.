Richard:

The only thing I needed to revise was the term.  As provided in my first set 
of comments, the maximum term that I have authority to approve is 2 years for 
a bilateral NDA.  If I2 insists on 3 years, I must obtain approval from Mark 
Haedicke, who is at a management conference through the end of the week.  
(Are we providing the bulk of the information to them or vice versa?)  



With regard to the Relationship Terms, this is the first I've ever seen of 
this document and I'm not sure if I'm the appropriate person to review the 
Agreement.  Wouldn't it be more appropriate for EnronCredit.com's lawyers in 
London to sign off on this Agreement.  (My involvement with EnronCredit.com 
has been limited to this single NDA.)  If you feel that this document 
requires our review instead, please let me know.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen

Leslie,
Craig Chaney tells me that you have been looking at these documents.
They need to be signed in the UK for tax reasons.
Can you therefore send confirmation to Denis that you are happy with them so 
he can initial them and I will then get them signed.

Many thanks,
Richard
