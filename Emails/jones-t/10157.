My vote is for something around Canterra - Brewsters or Red Devil.  I've been 
to Ceili's on Thursday nights and it is very busy and very noisy.  Someplace 
a bit quieter where we could talk is my vote.

Subject: Location for Drinks Tonight

Ladies, I tried to get us a reservation at Ceili's but they don't take 
reservations on Thursday and Friday nights because their happy hour fall on 
those nights (first come first served attitude).

So, here's the dilemma, do we risk it and just head over to Ceili's and take 
our chances we will get in or would you like to try and go somewhere around 
Canterra (such as Brewsters, Fionn MacCools, Red Devil, etc.).  Let me know 
your preference.

Nella

PS: We should try and be at any of these places by 5:00 at the latest in the 
hopes that we can get in.  (It's times like these when you wished you worked 
until 4:00 or 4:30 like the rest of the world.)
