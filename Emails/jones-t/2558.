1.  I am told that sometime this afternoon I will be moved to 3880d -- that 
is the cubicle directly across from Shari Stack's office.

2.  I may be out of the office all day Tuesday and a half-day Wednesday.  I 
am going to try to get in the derivatives seminar for those dates.  If I am 
not in my new location at all tomorrow, that means I succeeded in getting 
into the class.  I will check for voice messages during  breaks.  If, for 
some reason, my voice mail does not successfully survive the move, you can 
try me on my cell phone (713-594-2683).  It will be turned off during the 
seminar but it receives voice messages, which I will check during breaks.
