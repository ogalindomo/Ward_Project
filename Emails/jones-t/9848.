This is to confirm our discussions that the Bandwidth group no longer uses 
the Global contracts database.  Bandwidth is now independent of Global for 
contracts inquiries and online approvals.  All communication about Bandwidth 
contracts will be directed to Amy Heffernan, Molly LaFuze, and Danny Clark.

Please let me know if your understanding differs.

Thank you for your part in completing a smooth transition process!
