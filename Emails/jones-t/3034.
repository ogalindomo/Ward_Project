Tana,

With regards to the division issue- we(Product Control) don't necessarily 
know that a company is a division until we receive the profile from credit.  
We then request a new PA from the company with the division language added.  
We make sure that we receive the corrected PA before we send out the password 
and user ID.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Subject: Counterparty Approval Lists for 7/31/00, 8/1/00 and 8/2/00

Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

7/31/00 List - I am not opening up Equitable Gas Company, because it does not 
say a division of Equitable Resources Inc.  I thought that was our deal.
8/1/00 List- I cannot review NSTAR Companies yet.  There is some question as 
to whether that is a correct legal entity.
