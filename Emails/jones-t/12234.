Good Morning!

Cheryl has contacted me this morning to tell me she is very sick.  She has 
expressed to me that she will be seeking a doctor appointment this morning, 
and if possible, will try to come in this afternoon around 5pm.  However, she 
will check her voicemail periodically.  If you should need immediate 
assistance, please feel free to contact me directly.   Thank you for your 
attention to this matter.


Regards,

p.s. - Kayla and Karina:  Cheryl indicated to me that she is working on many 
issues with GSS, and if possible would like to notify the persons involved in 
those matters.  Please call me to tell me how I can aid in doing so.  Thank 
you!!!!
