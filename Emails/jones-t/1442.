In preparation for the Windows 2000 roll out, a representative from the IT 
group will be coming by to confirm with each of you the applications you are 
using on your computer.  As many of us utilize different databases and 
software, we would like to get an accurate account of your PC in order to 
provide a smooth transition.  Please take a moment to visit with the IT 
representative and provide the necessary information.

The roll out is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, May 2, Thursday, May 4,
Tuesday, May 9, and Thursday, May 11.

The most substantial changes will be:
? Organizer is going away.
? We will need to rely on the calendar feature in Lotus Notes.  
? Everything in Organizer is mirrored in Lotus Notes.
? As a safeguard, you may want to print your calendar for the current week in 
the   unlikely event of a technical problem.
? Windows 2000 is a web-based environment.

Training:
? Will be held in EB 0568
? Approximately 2 hours
? Check the attached schedule for the date and time you are scheduled.
? Be sure to log out before going to class.
? Classes are limited in size, so please make every attempt to attend at the 
scheduled  time.  
? Scheduling was determined by the Administrative Assistant's working group 
due to   the need of viewing group calendars.  
? While you are in training, the IT group will bring your new CPU (if 
required) or    configure your computer for Windows 2000.
? Please be aware that this process could take slightly longer than the 
training class --  there will be 1 IT person for every 2 computers.  
? IT representatives will be on the floor to assist you with any problems you 
may   encounter.  

If you have questions, please feel free to call Sheri Cromwell, Janette 
Elbertson, Taffy Milligan, or Nony Flores.  We think you will be pleased with 
the new features of the web-based environment of Windows 2000 and with the 
speed of our new computers!  Again, thank you for your help in making this a 
smooth transition to Windows 2000.
