Yes, I'm here finally.  What a fiasco!  I got here yesterday morning and no 
phone, computer or boxes.  Karen, my assistant had put in all the work 
requests, and Robin had come right behind her and cancelled them.  Go 
figure!  Anyway, Robin was out yesterday and today, so Karen had to start 
getting everything in place for me.  I got my computer at 5:00 and my phone 
right before lunch today.  I started to call Mark and ask if I could come 
back.  I guess eventually, it will all work out. 

Let's do lunch!
