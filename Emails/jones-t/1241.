As you are probably already aware, Enron has been named the Most Innovative 
Company in America for the past five years.  What do you think we can do to 
hold this rank?  By finding new ways to manage our intellectual talent?  By 
creating new products that can be traded as a commodity?  By developing new 
e-commerce activities for our business unit efforts?  By sharing knowledge 
across the company and implementing competitive intelligence activities?  
What do you think?  What are your ideas?

The eThink Team has opened up a category in eMeet at ethink.enron.com for you 
to share your comments, suggestions and ideas.  Please join us on this 
company-wide effort to stay ahead of the competition.

NEW & IMPROVED: we have now installed a "trigger response method" onto the 
eMeet system.  If you enter your email address while creating a topic, you 
will be sent an email when someone has responded to your topic!
