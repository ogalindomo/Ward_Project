Attached is the "final" counterparty matrix that is going to be uploaded into 
EOL.  Please carefully review the tab that corresponds to your area of 
expertise (i.e. credit, legal, tax, contracts) or the cumulative tab entitled 
"Upload with Values".  The list is a compilation of the files that have been 
forwarded to us and therefore is assumed to be identical to what we received 
from you.  We anticipate that there will be very few changes to the 
spreadsheet therefore any changes that need to be made should be communicated 
through e-mail and NOT on the attached worksheet.  Please forward all 
necessary changes to Frank Davis or Bob Shults by Wednesday, November 3.  
Your "sign-off" is critical in order to ensure that only accurate information 
is uploaded into EOL. 

Your anticipated co-operation is greatly appreciated!!!
