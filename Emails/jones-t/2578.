Bryan,

I have spoken with Steve Norris of Tembec about the above assignment.  From 
the beginning, Credit has been perfectly willing to go along with this 
assignment as financial information and public debt ratings are available for 
the proposed assignee.  Credit remains amenable. However, we have been 
waiting for documentation from Tembec effecting this assignment.  

On speaking with Steve, he suggested that Enron provide the documentation.  
After making some inquiries, it is my understanding that Enron does not 
provide these legal services for its counterparties.   I have left a voice 
mail with Steve conveying this message.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
