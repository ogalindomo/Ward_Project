Tana,

I had checked with Nicole Hunter before sending out the second e-mail as they 
were counter-parties we were waiting on additional information on and didn't 
have them prior to sending the first e-mail out. WIll try and send one a day 
in the future. Sorry for the confusion. Thanks.

Aparna

Can you please send me only 1 list of Clickpaper counterparties per day.  It 
gets very confusing for me sometimes to figure out what lists I should be 
responding to when I get multiple lists.
