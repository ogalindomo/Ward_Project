I am expecting this transaction to close by the end of business today.  Just 
a reminder about a few follow up items that must be dealt with promptly:

1)  Some communications must be made with the employees/union (my 
understanding is that Rick Johnson will be in charge of this process);
2)  Demographic information regarding Garden State's employees must be given 
to Dolores Lenfest A.S.A.P. so that she can set up the necessary benefit 
plans for these employees;
3)  An HSR filing must be made within 10 Business Days following signature of 
the documents (I calculate this to be July 27th) - This is being handled by 
Ann Ballard of Corp. who has already made contact with George Mahoney 
(internal counsel for Media General).  Ann will need some assistance in 
circulating certain requests for information as well as getting certain 
affidavits signed - Since Peter returns on Monday, I expect that he will be 
able to shepherd this along;
4)  The Remediation Agreement Application must be signed within 5 days after 
execution of the docs (I have an original counterpart that has been signed by 
Media General and am awaiting approval by LLGM before circulating for 
signature by ENA);
5)  On Monday, we need to obtain original signatures on original docs (LLGM 
will prepare 4 original sets of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Site 
Access Agreement and Tana Jones will put together four copies of the Swap 
documents - I will forward four original signature pages of the P&S and the 
Site Access via messenger on Monday to LLGM's office in Houston along with 
Tana's docs for distribution by LLGM);
6)  Insurance needs to be a top priority - My understanding is that Jim and 
David will be looking into both new insurance policies to cover Garden 
State's post closing liability and environmental liability insurance to cover 
potential off-site liability; and
7)  We need to focus on preparing and executing an O&M Agreement (I have 
prepared a term sheet and forwarded it to the appropriate parties).

If anything else comes to mind, please advise as soon as possible.  Thanks, 
in advance, for your assistance in these matters.  Also, congratulations to 
all parties involved in this transaction.
