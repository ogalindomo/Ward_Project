We are going to be discussing a potential joint business venture around a 
technology company.  I suspect the standard language that is being used by 
the originators in Rex Shelby's group would suffice.  Also, the bilateral 
form is best as they will be sharing information about the industry and their 
companies experience in the industry.

What is the nature of the confidential information being discussed?  Will our 
standard language "...furnished in connection with a possible transaction or 
other business relationship..." suffice, or do you want to be more specific?  
Also, do you want the bilateral form?
