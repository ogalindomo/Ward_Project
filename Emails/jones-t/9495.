Trena, Tana Jones of our legal department coordinates a variety of EOL 
functions.  She would like a description of the products we are planning on 
rolling out in April (a bit more of a description than I can give her), and 
she may have some other questions for you as well.  When you get a few 
minutes, would you please call Tana at 713-853-3399 to fill her in?  thanks 
-- Bob
