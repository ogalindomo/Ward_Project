As you know, we are planning a baby shower for Carol St. Clair on Friday, 
June 9, 2000.  FYI . . . we are collecting money for a gift certificate/group 
gift.  If you would prefer to make a contribution toward the gift 
certificate/group gift in lieu of buying an individual gift, please call me 
at ext. 3-3439 before Tuesday, June 6.

Thanks,

Carolyn
