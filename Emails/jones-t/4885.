Hi Tana,

I have heard that the above company did quite a few EOL metals trades last 
week.  This is fine because they were on the list of companies you emailed me 
on 10/13/2000.  

I know there is quite a push going on at the moment to get more metals trades 
on line.  The metals people told me that the applications were being 
processed in London (and I guess not in Houston but I am still quite unsure 
about how this works - I am sorry if I sound vague) and I just wanted to 
check with you that as discussed previously any Japanese companies applying 
for passwords which are not on the list you emailed me, will come by my desk 
prior to approval for trading.

Also just to clarify, the applications by Daiwa Futures and a company called 
NAW Co. Ltd, have been closed according to that list so I would need to see 
any future applications by them.

Thanks.

If you need to send this onto anyone in London, pls copy me so i know for the 
future.

Jane
