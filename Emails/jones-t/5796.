Tana Jones is coordinating execution of the NDA with London.  We did not work 
on the MOU, so I don't know where it's at or who is handling getting it 
executed.  Please contact Tana Jones directly to coordinate these efforts.

Regards,

Leslie

Leslie:

Thanks for your email.

If you would, please coordinate this NDA with Richard and Denis in London
so that both the NDA and the MOU are signed.

Afterwards, they could both be finalized and sent via FedEx (or fax if Steve 
is amenable to that)
 either from your office or Richard Sage's office by tomorrow to Steve Wagner 
in New York so that ERisk
 may have it signed and returned to you before our meeting on Tuesday Dec 12.

Thanks for your prompt attention to this.

David

Steve:

All of your proposed changes are acceptable.  I'm finalizing the document as 
per the attached and will have it sent to you for execution after I have had 
it executed on my end.  To whom should I send the execution document?  In the 
interests of time, I suggest that we exchange fax copies.
