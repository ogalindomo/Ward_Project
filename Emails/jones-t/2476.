Evidently there are a few Masters on the Financial side (MG Ltd).  The best 
person for you to speak to is Kevin Rhodes.  I have told him who you are so 
he won't be surprised if you email/call him.

Kevin Rhodes  011 44 207 7265 5457       kevin.rhodes@mgltd.com     (also 
Hamish Scutt at    hamish.scutt@mgltd.com)

Kevin should be able to get all the information you need.

Regards,
Lara

Tana,  To date we do not know how many (if any) financial masters MG has in 
place.  We'll check it out at this end and let you know when we have further 
details.  Thanks, Edmund

Do we have a list and copies of any financial master agreements MG has in 
place?  When can we receive copies?
