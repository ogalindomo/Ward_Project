The Kodak IS 110 copier in EB 38K1 will be down for extensive service 
beginning Friday, June 30th, through Tuesday, July 4th.

If you anticipate any large copy jobs, please allow extra time for completion 
by the copy center downstairs.  The copier should be functional by Wednesday; 
however, it could take longer if they find that certain parts need to be 
replaced.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but hopefully we will circumvent future service 
problems with this machine.
