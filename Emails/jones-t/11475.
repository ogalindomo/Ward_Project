The attached name changes were made in the Counterparty system last night, 
May 3.  I am unable to attach the regular report to an email message because 
of it's size.  I am working to remedy that situation, and I will notify you 
once it has been resolved.

Short name changes will be coordinated with ERMS IT tomorrow, May 4.




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Cheryl x33103
