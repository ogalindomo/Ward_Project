Tana, I will be on leave until 2 January 2001. Over that period I have made 
arrangements for the legal review of the daily EOL credit responses to be 
reviewed  outside counsel. Accordingly over that period would you forward the 
daily spreadsheets to my admin. assistant Alison Keogh. She will then 
coordinate the review. Whilst counsel have been briefed on the process and 
what is expected of them  it would be of assistance if you would continue 
your current practice of highlighting in your covering email any particular 
counterparties on which you would like a response from us.
