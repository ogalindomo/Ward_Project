Hello, Tana,

I have been asked if we could please be provided an electronic version of the 
Non-Disclosure Agreement that you and I worked on together on Monday between 
Cap Gemini Ernst & Young U. S. LLC, Enron Net Works LLC, and EnronOnline, 
LLC.  By the way, I just received the interoffice envelope with the two 
originals, and I will have Eric Grest sign them both.  I will return one 
fully executed original to you ASAP (thank you very much!).

Would it be possible to receive the electronic version today, as I'm 
scheduling a conference call for the CGEY people, and they must each have a 
copy of the agreement prior to the call?

Thank you very much!
