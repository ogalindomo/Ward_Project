Emerson: NOT APPROVED FOR US PHYSICAL POWER. (Not a current CP/Not FERC 
approved). 

All the others on the list: "Ditto Credit" - or in other words,  no change to 
the physical power profiles for these CP's if they are currently trading on 
EOL. If they are not currently trading on EOL, then they are not approved for 
physical power.  

Thanks, 

Shari
