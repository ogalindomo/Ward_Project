Tana:

I am amending my response a  bit:

The following CPs should be profiled as ENRON SALES only:  

Minnesota Power, Inc.
Southwestern Public Service Company

Rhonda:  I discussed these CPs with Dana.  We have old paper and don't do 
much volume.  Accordingly, these CPs must trade pursuant to the on-line GTCs, 
which means that they must receive an override letter.
