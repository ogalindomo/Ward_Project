		 Subject: Huntlaw Corporate Services Limited -  COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES FOR 
CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANIES

I'm attaching a memorandum from Hunter & Hunter, our Cayman Islands counsel, 
regarding recent changes in Cayman Islands laws and regulations.  Please 
forward it to other interested parties in your departments.

One immediate consequence of these changes is the request by counsel that we 
provide them with more detail on the intended business activities of our new 
subsidiaries in the A&J memos that are sent to them.  Without being 
impractical, something more than "Oil & Gas exploration in Mexico" (by way of 
example) is requested.  If it is impossible to provide more meaningful detail 
without going on extensively, then the current practice will have to continue 
to be acceptable.  However, a business purpose of "holding company" is 
probably not going to be acceptable.

If you have specific questions or concerns after reviewing the memorandum, I 
suggest that you contact Rory Todd or another representative of Hunter & 
Hunter (phone:  345-949-4900; fax:  345-949-5175; email rtodd@huntlaw.com.ky).
