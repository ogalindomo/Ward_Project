As I reminder, I have to meet a contractor at my house this afternoon and 
will be leaving at 2 p.m., which means that I will miss the legal/credit 
group meeting.

Please assure the credit group that only the ugly spectre of foundation 
repair could prevent a member of the legal team from missing our bi-weekly 
meeting.  Seriously, though, if anyone has a question about any deal I am 
working on, I do not mind at all if you call me on my cell phone 
(713-594-2683).
