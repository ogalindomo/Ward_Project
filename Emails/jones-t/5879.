Tana,

I have inter-officed a few documents to you.  Enclosed in the envelope you 
will find signed copies of the NASDAQ & Dow Jones Enterprise agreements for 
content which we are currently receiving on EnronOnline.  I believe you had 
stated that you would keep the originals and then send us a copy for our 
records.   

I have also enclosed the original affidavits from the winners of the latest 
EnronOnline competition - Load the Bases.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Make It A Great Day!!
