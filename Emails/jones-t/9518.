Some lawyers outside the swaps/Enron Net Works group are inquiring about 
attending the CFMA session we have scheduled with Ken Raisler for Monday, 
March 5th.   The CFMA raises a number of issues that are of interest 
throughout the Enron Wholesale Services legal department, and I think a 
presentation to the entire EWS group will probably be in order at some point.

However, I think it is important that we keep the March 5th session specific 
to the swaps/Enron Net Works group.  This is meant to be more of a 
question-and-answer "workshop" session rather than a "big-picture" 
presentation of the new law.   My concern is that if too wide a variety of 
questions and issues are raised, we will not have enough time to focus on the 
detailed financial trading issues and the appropriate form changes we need to 
discuss with Ken.

Please help me in keeping attendance at the appropriate level so that we may 
have a productive and focused session.  Thank you -- Bob
