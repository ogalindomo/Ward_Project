Thank you.  I could wait until maybe Friday.

I've been meaning to ask you if you have ever used Kim (Nails) to do any
seamstress work.  I left some fabric with her to copy a skirt to go around
my bathroom sink and got it back yesterday.  It's not the worst job I have
ever seen, but I am a little shocked at the work.  I don't mean to be too
critical.  I should have done it myself, but thought if she did it, it would
save me one more little chore.  Oh, well, live and learn!!
