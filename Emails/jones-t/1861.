Attached is the Global Contracts Assignment, Termination and Exploration 
Report for May 2000. This report is very long this month due to clean-up of 
CES data. If you have any questions please call me at 3-5686 or email me.

Also if you do not wish to receive this report any longer please inform me 
and I will remove your name from the list. 

Thanks
