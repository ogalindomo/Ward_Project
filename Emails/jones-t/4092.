Please amend the ISDA dated 6/12/97 between ENA and the counterparty by 
reducing TransAlta's collateral threshold from $15MM (CAD $) to $10MM (CAD 
$).  Credit is just reshifting line allocations with the different TransAlta 
entities.  The contacts at the cp are:
  Maureen Piercey (credit)  403-267-7987
  Sterling Koch (legal) 403-267-6991
Call with comments or questions.  Thanks
