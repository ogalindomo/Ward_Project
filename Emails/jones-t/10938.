On April 23rd, Enron Houston employees will be invited to celebrate the 
Topping-Out of Enron Center South. This exciting day will be a celebration 
for all Enron employees, our contractors and construction crew and for the 
city of Houston.

Enron Center South is the first high-rise office tower to be erected in 
downtown Houston in more than 10 years. We are proud to continue our efforts 
keeping Houston a world-class city by creating this innovative new building 
designed by world-renowned architect Cesar Pelli.

All Enron Houston employees will have an opportunity to play a part in the 
Topping-Out celebration by signing their name to the last beam before it is 
hoisted atop the new building. Beginning April 16th, please take the time to 
sign your name on the beam located in the Enron Building lobby.
