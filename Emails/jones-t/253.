Mark,

There has never been a time in our Group before where any member of our Group 
was cut off from mass distributions that were sent to all of our client base 
and member of the Group but me.  If the intent is to cut me off and make me 
feel isolated from the Group and my friends, clients and customers and 
associates it is working!

Does this mean you come of the list? We kept you on at your request even 
though you were not drafting the docs.
