I didn't respond because these CPs are okay to trade US power.  Although I 
sometime add comments at the bottom of my e-mails re CPs that are authorized 
to trade (for my notes more than anything and for Rhonda), if I respond to a 
particular list and don't comment on a CP, you can assume that they are okay 
to trade US power.

Leslie,

On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy 
Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.  I have no record on 
PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even 
though it says amended.  Thanks.
