Subject: Enron Officer's Certificates re: PPA


As per my voicemail, attached are the officer's certificates we will require.

Do you know what address TD Bank will be using on the ISDAs?  (presumably 
their Calgary Main Branch)  also, are there transaction numbers for each of 
the ISDAs yet so that we can fill in the blanks on the certificate and 
opinions (RE ISDA Agreement Master No. ?)

Thanks

Kevin
