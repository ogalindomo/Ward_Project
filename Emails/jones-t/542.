Attached is another list for approval.  Under the comments section, if it 
says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved 
the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a 
division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty 
name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved 
to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing.
