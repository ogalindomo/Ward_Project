Tana-

I work in the Tax Department with Mark Ng and I was wondering if you had the 
information on which entities will be included in the ENA footnote as of 
12/31/00.  If you are not the right person to contact on this matter, I 
apologize for taking up your time.  Please let me know the contact on this if 
possible.


Thank you,
