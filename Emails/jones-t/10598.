One way only should do.  I am sending a requirements document to them, and 
they will return a proposal for services to us.  There isn't anything 
proprietary about their proposal.

As soon as I obtain the four pieces of information for both companies, I'll 
forward it to you.

Will,

I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so 
I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.  I also need 
to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a 
one way form that protects Enron only.  In circumstances where we are certain 
Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to 
use that form.  Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential 
information you are discussing so we can protect the information being 
discussed.

Will -

This is still the case.  

Please copy Tana Jones on the information and she will generate the 
agreements for our use.

Thanks.

I need two non-disclosure agreements before sharing our DocuLogic functional 
requirements document with an external consulting company with expertise in 
building document management systems.  Can you make these for me, or should I 
approach IT's contracts department?

Last time I had them made, Enron required (1) official name of company, (2) 
state of incorporation, (3) principal address of business, (4) name/title of 
their authorized signatory.  Is this still the case?
