[Science is] not belief, but the will to find out. 
- Anon

There are two paths we can follow with technology.  The first is to use 
technology to link us together, even across great distances, for shared 
events and experiences.  The second is to allow technology to isolate us by 
providing us the means to limit our interaction with others.

Which path will you choose?  Do you think we will get to choose, or will the 
choice be made for us by the primary users of the technology?  If we can 
choose, what will happen to those who take the second path?  What would those 
on the first path stand to lose by this divergence? 

Will our dependence on technology continue to benefit us, or will it make us 
uniquely vulnerable in ways our primitive forebears never were?  How has "the 
will to find out" helped you select your path?  Visit eMeet and share your
