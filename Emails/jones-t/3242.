Tana,

Thanks for waiting around this morning for David Minns. I'm not sure if you 
got to hear his message before you left however Powercor should now be good 
to go. I would really like to have them set up and trading by tomorrow 
morning Sydney time so I would appreciate it if you could send me the 
spreadsheet first chance you get.

Thanks for your help,

Justin
