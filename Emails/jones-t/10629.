Please see the below NDA request.  

This is in relation to the Letter of Interest I put in your box this am.  
Basically, ENW is going to team with a consulting company to provide a 
pipeline portfolio management solution to CMS Panhandle Pipeline Companies.  
This proposal will involve some work with ETS and, therefore, both groups 
want to be covered under one NDA.  It needs to be bilateral as CMS will be 
disclosing information to us also.

I will get particulars from Stephen about CMS and have you copied on the 
information.

Thanks.

Mark,

Thanks for agreeing to help prepare this NDA.  As we discussed on the phone, 
our team is now in a position to begin detailed negotiations with CMS for a 
systems solution project (CMS Energy - Panhandle Pipe Line Companies).  As a 
part of the negotiations we will need to disclose some detailed information 
about ETS systems.  

Steve Hotte (CIO of ETS) and our team agreed that we should to execute an NDA 
that covers both ENW and ETS and gave me Drew's name as their legal council.

The contact name at CMS should be:

Cynthia C. Albert
Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Information Systems
5444 Westheimer Road
Houston, TX 77210-4967

713-989-7334
tsmehta@cmsenergy.com

On the Enron side, I would use

David Berberian for ENW
Steve Hotte for ETS

for signatories.

I hope this is sufficient information to prepare one or two NDA's whichever 
is appropriate.

Sincerely,
Steve Abbanat
