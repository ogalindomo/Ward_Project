here is one more agreement.  If you could please review the comments they 
have made, and if OK obtain a signature within Enron, and then fax to them 
for their return signature.

thanks

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement





Dave:

The approved confidentiality agreement is attached below.  As you can see, 
there
are just a couple of small change.

Steven and I will call you at three to talk a little more about commercial
arrangements.  If there's any headcounts you can send over before then (i.e.,
the number of people trading on and visiting the site, plus those with 
read-only
access), that would be helpful.

Regards,
Peter Ogram
Manager, Fieldston Publications
