When I was looking at last year's data, I noticed that the due date on last 
year's NYMEX financials was the end of June.  Did the due date get moved back 
to July?  Please let me know as soon as possible.


Thanks

I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of 
July, so we should probably target them to be done a little earlier, since we 
always seem to need more time.
