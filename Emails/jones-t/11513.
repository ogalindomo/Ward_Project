		 Subject: Another two guests?

We have had an overwhelmingly favorable response to the May19 Church 
Gourmet.  I have already added one extra party to accomodate the additional 
guests.  We now have 48 participants and need a place at the table for 2 or 4 
of them.  Is there any way that Tana or Kleta could add a couple of chairs to 
their tables to squeeze in two more?  Poor Lisa Kennedy has found herself 
with a potential for 16 guests in her townhouse and is not sure where they 
will all fit.  

If Henry and I could move to Tana's house and Kleta could pick up Dan and 
Andrea Goodwin, this would solve the problem.

This is a great problem to have - more than half of the participants in the 
dinner are new members at CTK - I hope you can help out.

P.S.  We can loan you extra chairs if necessary..
