Per my voice mail from yesterday evening, attached for you and your counsel's 
review and comment please find Enron's comments to your revision to the 
initial draft of the Non- Disclosure Agreement.

Our comments reflect the following:

Section 5(b) has been modified to be inclusive of the Confidential 
Information; and
Section 11 - Enron requires that arbitration be a part of the NDA

Please call Mark Greenberg, Enron in-house counsel at 713-345-8897 if you 
have any questions or comments to the attached.

Please call me at 713-345-4482 if you need to discuss any matters further.
