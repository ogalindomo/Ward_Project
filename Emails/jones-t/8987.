I spoke to the traders on the West Desk, and "EPMI Long Term California" 
should be documented as Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  "Long Term California" 
is just a book on the West Desk

		 Subject: EOL Deals between EPMI and RMT

We have recently traded a few deals between EPMI Long Term California and 
Risk Management and Trading Corp. The way these are booked now indicates that 
a Confirm will need to be generated between the two. Joe Hunter thinks that 
these should probably be book to book transactions. The EPMI Long Term 
California entity has not been used for financial nat gas transactions before 
this. Can you shed some light on to whether or not EPMI should be considered 
a subsidiary similar to ECC or EES.

Thanks.
