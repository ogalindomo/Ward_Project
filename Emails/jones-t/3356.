Let's keep Shari on the distribution list permanently so that she can be my 
back up if I'm out sick, etc.  She can just delete the lists when I am in the 
office.

Is this forever, or just for the week?

Tana:

Beginning this week, Shari will reply to EOL credit approval lists.  I will 
be out after Tuesday of next week through Friday, Sept. 8.  Will you add 
Shari to the distribution list effective as soon as possible so that she 
receives the list tomorrow.

Thanks,

Leslie
