Actually, can we amend it so that it is "unilateral" on the part of Enron (we 
agree not to disclose information they give us, but not the other way 
around)?  EnronCredit is not providing Duke with any confidential 
information, our pricing information is very public and I don't want them 
worrying about them breaching a CA when they are using our pricing.

Regards,  Bruce
