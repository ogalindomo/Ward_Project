Hi Deb.  Do you know if Solo Energy closed in August?  If so, have you 
received closing docs?  I am trying to get the 3rd Quarter Share Verification 
Report out by early next week, and the DASH for Solo shows that ENA will 
receive 6.4 million shares of Seried C Convertible Preferred Stock. Also, ENA 
will receive warrants exercisable for 4.5 million shares of Series C Conv. 
Pref.  Do you know if this is in fact what happened?  If you have any backup 
for these shares it would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise, just let me know 
if you know anything!  :-)

Also, do you have Spinnaker Exploration Company closing docs?

Thank you for your help!
