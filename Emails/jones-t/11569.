Good Morning All!

Cheryl will be out of town and is unable to attend this class.  She must have 
someone to attend this class in her place; the deadline to cancel has already 
passed.  Would anyone be interested in taking her place?  If so, please 
contact me, and I will make the necessary arrangements.  Thank you for your 
attention to this matter.  

Regards,
Keegan Farrell
