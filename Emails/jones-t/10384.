I have had a request for an NDA with Zefer Boston.  They are a consulting 
firm working with Fleet Boston on a deal with CommodityLogic.  Could you 
please prepare an NDA (using the Fleet Boston NDA as a base) for the 
following:

Zefer Boston
119 Beach Street
Boston, MA 02111-2511

It is for Tom Gros.


Thanks.
