Due to the volume of deals (260) related to this assignment, we've asked 
Curtis Smith in TAGG/IT Support to move these over in a batch process.  I'll 
let you know a timeframe as soon as he gets back to me.

thanks
Joe

Subject: Statoil/J Aron assignment

As we have consented to the assignment of the trades under the Statoil Energy 
Trading ISDA to JAron, could you tell me what the timeline will be for moving 
these transactions in TAGG/ERMS to JAron?

Thanks!
