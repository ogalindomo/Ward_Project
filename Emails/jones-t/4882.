We have received an executed Termination Agreement between El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas L.P. ("El Paso") and ENA dated October 12, 2000 but effective as 
of December 1, 1999.  This Termination Agreement terminates the ISDA Master 
dated April 20, 1995, which was assigned to El Paso by El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas Company.  El Paso and ENA then entered into a new ISDA Master 
dated June 30, 2000 but effective as of December 1, 1999.  The new Master 
covers all Transactions entered into under the April 1995 Master, and new 
guarantees were issued that replaced the guarantees issued under the April 
1995 Master.
