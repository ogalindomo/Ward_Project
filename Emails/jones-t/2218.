Hello All,

We are putting together an interactive CD for use by new and existing Enron 
employees who would like to know more about EnronOnline and how our groups 
work together from start to finish.  

Attached are the topics that are to be covered by each of your respective 
groups.  The items in bold denote the main points that users will be able to 
click on.  The items indented below each of these is what needs to have a 
script.  Please keep in mind that all information should be viewed from the 
customer perspective.  For example, if a customer or someone new to Enron 
were to ask about a specific bolded topic how  would you answer it.  Please 
limit your script to 5 minutes and if you feel something pertinent has been 
left out, please add it with the understanding that it may not make it to the 
final draft.  We have a very limited time frame in which to complete this 
task, so please email me your scripts (and cc: Daniel Diamond, by end of day 
Friday, June 23).  If you have any questions, please contact me at the 
extension below.  I will be out on Friday and Dan will be sending the scripts 
on.



Thank you in advance for your time and help,

Lisa Gillette
