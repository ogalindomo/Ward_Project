Subject: 02-28-01 exceptions


Here is a list of exceptions that we talked about earlier this morning that 
are different from what Global Counterperty came up with: This is the correct 
legal name that we ran D&B's on and have been approved.

1. Caraustar Recovered Fiber Group Inc.
2. Seaman Paper Company pf Massachusetts, Inc.
3. Taiga Forest Products

All other exceptions you had are the same as what GlobalCounterparty came up 
with. Let me know if you have any further questions. Thanks.
