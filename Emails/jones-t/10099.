Hi Everyone,

You may recall that on the Feb 2001 notification report, there were several 
PG&E entities with name changes to El Paso.  There were also 3 Teco 
conversions.    It was noted on the report that there was no documentation 
for the changes.  We have received documentation for 3 of the entities and 
they are attached below.  The rest have been requested from El Paso's 
Corporate Secretary's office and will be forwarded upon receipt.  

 - PG&E EnerTraHoldCorp to EPGT TradHold.pdf
 - PG&E Tx VGM to EPGT Tx VGM, LP.pdf
 - Teco Gas Marketing LLC.pdf
 - Teco Gas Mktg Co to Teco Gas Mktg LLC.pdf

Thanks,
