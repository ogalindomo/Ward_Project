Good Morning All!

FYI,  I just spoke with Mark Frevert's assistant, and she has informed me 
that today is the only day he will be in the office this week.  There is a 
slight possibility that he will be in on Friday for a small amount of time.  
He will be going on vacation to the Virgin Islands for the next two weeks.  I 
was also told it will be highly unlikely that he will have faxing 
capabilities.  I just wanted to give you all a heads-up, just in case you 
might foresee the need for his signature in the near future.  Thank you for 
your attention to this matter.  

Regards,
Keegan
