The Enron Building will close at 10:30 P.M. on Saturday, April, 15, and 
reopen at 11:00 A.M. on Sunday, April 16. Only pre-approved and authorized 
employees and contractors will be allowed access to the Enron Building during 
this time. 

Several major preventative maintenance procedures must be performed on the 
facility's main switchgear that require a complete shut down of the 
building's normal electrical system. Computer equipment served by back-up 
power systems will remain operational. For safety and security reasons, the 
Enron Building will close at 10:30 P.M. on Saturday, April, 15, and reopen at 
11:00 A.M. on Sunday, April 16, after the work is completed. 

 To avoid any possible computer problems on Monday morning, please turn off 
your PC before leaving the building for the weekend or prior to 11:00 P.M. 
Saturday night. If there is any severe weather in the Houston area, this work 
will be rescheduled. During the building closure, you may call 713-853-5361 
to check on the progress of the work and verify when the building will be 
opened. 

Please contact the Facilities Help Desk (3-6300) or Randy Lord (5-7707) if 
you have any questions regarding the power shutdown.

Your co-operation in this effort is sincerely appreciated.
