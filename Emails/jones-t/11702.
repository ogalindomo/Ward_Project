Tana always receives the following error message when updating cp profiles.  
I went up to see what she is doing and these are the steps.

Filters - then select all
Update
Receives message that there are no more records and hits OK
Then the system updates the records again (she says is quite slow)
Once complete with Update this message appears.

Let me know if you need additional information on this.

Thanks,
Stephanie
