Tana,

I am approaching Ernst & Young in regards to a potential relationship.  To 
summarize the relationship, E&Y would act in a system integrator role between 
EnronOnline and EnronOnline customers.  Do we have an NDA (or similar doc) in 
place that would allow this discussion to take place without an additional 
NDA?

Please let me know.

Thank you.

Mike Bridges
