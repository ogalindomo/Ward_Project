Sheri -

For purposes of reviewing product descriptions for the Natsource Direct 
on-line trading platform, the following people will need site access or 
copies of the product descriptions:

Brent Hendry - Financial and Weather Products
Dan Hyvl - Physical Gas Products
Marcus Nettelton - Emissions/Environment
Wayne Gresham - Coal
Shari Stack - Physical Power

I will also need access to review any GTC or other on-line agreements.

I have a copy of the access agreement and will be reviewing it shortly for 
Enron comments. 

Thanks for the assistance.
