Because we have agreed to amend the existing Master Agreement by taking out 
the $5MM credit line, certain parameters were agreed to in advance by Bill, 
Fred, and myself.  All deals must mature within the prompt 18 months and the 
maximum amount of notional volumes cannot exceed  10 Bcf.  These terms will 
be strictly enforced and included within all credit decisions.

I am forwarding to legal the following amendment request.
