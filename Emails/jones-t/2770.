I have tentatively scheduled swaps training w/ Tana for Thursday and Friday 
of this week, so (unless it is cancelled) I will be in the building but out 
of my office for most of those two days.  Also, I will be leaving the office 
about 4 p.m. Friday.  I will check voice messages throughout training.
