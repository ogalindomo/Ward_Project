Effective immediately, please note the NEW assignments for Global Contracts 
team members.  These assignments may change again in April when Cyndie 
Balfour-Flanagan returns from maternity leave, but please call the 
appropriate team member listed on the schedule until you are notified 
otherwise.

Please don't hesitate to call any of us if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR
