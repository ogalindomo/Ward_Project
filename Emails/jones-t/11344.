Tana:  I'm sending Rex's request to you in accordance with the plan we 
discussed  at our meeting with Mark, Stephanie and Irma.  

I have done a conflicts check and find nothing with or pertaining to BEA 
Systems to the best of my knowledge.

Let me know if you need anything further.   Thanks for your help and your 
ever prompt return of executed agreements to me for the database.

Travis, Kay --

Can you get a copy of our Offline NDA to Kevin Montagne so that he can 
forward it to BEA Systems, Inc.  We are trying to see if we can arrange a 
meeting with BEA next week.  Thanks.
