Attached below is the Credit worksheet for an amendment to the Master Swap 
agreement (effective date 2/12/98).  The counterparty has requested that we 
amend the contract to change the Credit Support Provider from UEI Holdings, 
Inc. to Wescoast Gas Inc.  I have performed the appropriate credit analysis 
on the new counterparty, and they appear financially stronger than the 
current CSP.  All items to be amended are highlighted in red.

You can contact myself at 6-6002 or Russell at 5-7095 with any questions.

Thanks for your help,

Veronica
