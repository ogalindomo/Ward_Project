I think I'll answer this question for at least the fifth time in the last two 
weeks and the 200th time since I've been at Enron (including at least the 
third time I have answered for Carol and the third time I have answered for 
Mary).

Subject: Cash Collateral In Canada

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?
