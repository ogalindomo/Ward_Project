Hello Team,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for 
taking the time out of your busy schedules to discuss the above-subject 
career opportunity with Enron.

I was then and still am thoroughly interested in the Sr. Legal Specialist 
position. The job responsibilities and challenges discussed for the position 
and the amount of work available is enlightening and very much welcomed. As 
discussed, I believe my current background and skills fit perfecly into the 
scheme of the position. It would definitely be an honor and a pleasure to be 
a member of the group and Enron. I cannot wait to get started!

I realize that you have additional applicants that you are considering for 
this position, however, I firmly believe that my past and present experiences 
makes me the best candidate for the Sr. Legal Specialist position.

I am a quick learner, good listener, open-minded and adaptable to any given 
situation, and I thirst for knowledge. Learning "swaps and derivatives" will 
be a welcomed and exciting challenge.

If there is any additional information you may need during your decision 
process, please contact me directly at (713) 276-5564 or e-mail me at 
Duhdo@Gardere.com.

Again, thank you for the opportunity. Have a great weekend!

I look forward to seeing and talking to all of you again.


Don Duhon

P.S. My intention is to send this e-mail to all members of the swaps and 
derivatives group who interviewed me today. Please distrbute this e-mail to 
all those individuals of the group who did not receive a copy. Thank you.
