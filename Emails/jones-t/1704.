None of the following CPs are authorized to trade US power products:

Columbia Gulf Transmission Co. - restricted by legal
Enline Energy Solutions LLC - restricted by legal
Sunoco -- not a current trading partner and not a FERC approved marketer

I'm finishing up my review of the Japan list and will respond this morning.  
None of the CPs is a current trading partner, so unless a CP is on my FERC 
lists, it won't be authorized to trade.
