As a follow-up to our conversation this morning with Geoffery Chinn, I have 
made revisions to the TFS documents and have attached the revised versions 
below.  The only area I did not address was the "reasonable" insertions 
Geoffery wanted in Paragraph 2(c) of the BETA.  While I have no problem being 
"reasonable" with the procedures, I believe we need to keep our right to 
modify the terms and conditions of access and utilization as we see fit.  
Given that changes to the system affect a tremendous amount of users, I am 
sure we will be reasonable, but I do not want TFS to be the yardstick measure 
of our reasonableness.

Take a look at the attached when you have a chance and let's discuss any 
comments or questions you may have.  I will be out of the office tomorrow, 
but will catch up to you on Tuesday if we do not talk today.
