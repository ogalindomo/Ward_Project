("Fletcher") assigned certain trades between Fletcher and Enron Canada Corp. 
("ECC") to Apache Corporation ("Apache") and 2) ECC assigned the same trades

2001, whereby Apache and ENA agreed to  1) the above assignment, 2) amended 
thresholds for both parties, and 3) negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master 
Agreement by July 1, 2001.
