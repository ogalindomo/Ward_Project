Please plan on attending the first of a series of Credit/Legal seminars.  The 
first Seminar will be on Thursday March 8 from 11:30 to 1:00 pm in room 
EB49c3 and will cover the Credit issues raised in the ISDA Master Agreement 
and Omnibus General Terms and Conditions.  Lunch will be provided.  Email my 
assistant, Becky Spencer, if you are unable to attend.

Thank You,
