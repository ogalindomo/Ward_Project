Thanks Justin. As a follow-uo, Credit.com are now asking whether they can 
have a list of all counterparties with whom with executed ISDAs. I presume 
that is a long list but hopefully easily available. Thanks again for your 
help.

No, no ISDA's or other master agreements in place with this counterparty.

I have been asked by Credit.com whether there are ISDA agreements in place 
with the above mentioned banks (who are about to merge). I suspect the answer 
is No but please can we find out.
Thanks.
