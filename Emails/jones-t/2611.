To All:

Mark,
I sent a Master Firm credit worksheet to you about a month ago to draft a 
contract for this counterparty.  I spoke to Howard Sangwine today and he 
prefers a Financial contract sent to the counterparty rather than the 
physical contract.  Please do not send the Physical contract to them if you 
have not as of yet.  The company is not large enough to give credit on both 
contracts.

Susan,
I have attached a credit worksheet for an ISDA for this counterparty, please 
draft an agreement to be sent to the counterparty.

Howard,
Do you want the contract sent to them directly or are you going to deliver 
it.  If you want it sent to them directly please give me a contact name and 
phone number.

Thank you all,
Russell
