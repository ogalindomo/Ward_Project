They have not signed an EEI Master Power Purchase Agreement, or any master 
agreement with us, and are under credit review. Our starting position with 
this counterparty is that we will only accept changes to the EOL GTCs, as set 
out in any EEI Master Power Purchase Agreement agreed with EPMI. Please head 
off at the pass and save them any further unnecessary outside counsel legal 
bills!
 
Regards
 
Marcus

I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the 
referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that 
VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power 
confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain 
revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I 
looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved 
them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't 
allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override 
letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to 
handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and 
then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.
