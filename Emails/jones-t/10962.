Sorry - we missed this one. Don't hit maximize on the work queue.  Appears 
you can re-size the work queue window (stretch the window size).
Maximize will cause errors.

Kelly,

I get this error message after I update profile manager, but only after I 
maximize and change the column widths on the work queue screen.  Can someone 
look into this?

Thanks,
Susan
