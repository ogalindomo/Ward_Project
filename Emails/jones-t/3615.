TAGG upgrade has been completed and we can now access the application.  When 
you first launch TAGG it will take a couple of minutes to do a workstation 
installation, once the installation is complete you will see the familiar 
screen where you enter your password.  

Thanks.

		 Subject: TAGG Update

As of this morning, we have lost access to TAGG applications.  All Windows 
2000 users will not be able to access TAGG until the upgrade is completed.  
The team anticipates completion of the upgrade by the end of the week.

Thanks.
