John -

I received your voice mail regarding the desire to move forward with the GM 
NDA.  As we discussed, please ensure that your team is aware of GM's position 
on confidential and proprietary information.  That position is - (1) anything 
in writing that is not marked as proprietary or confidential does not need to 
be treated as such and could be subject to disclosure and (2) anything that 
is provided orally and not reduced to writing within 10 days of the 
disclosure (identifying it as proprietary or confidential), is subject to 
being treated as non-confidential information.  If you need assistance in 
putting together some plan to ensure documents are marked, I would be more 
than happy to assist or advise you as necessary.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.
