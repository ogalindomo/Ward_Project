Tana - the financial trading agreements database indicated that the Tembec 
Inc. (or Tembec Industries Inc.) ISDA is restricted to newsprint and lumber 
transactions only.  Two questions: 1) where do you indicate in the schedule 
that the ISDA is restricted to certain type of trades and 2) what do we have 
to do to amend the Tembec ISDA in order that we go ahead with a gas 
transaction.

Hope all is well.
