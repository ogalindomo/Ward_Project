I will have the documents emailed today.  In addition please feel free to 
contact Ms. Anna Gardiner +44 20 7783 4304 (ANNA.GARDINER@ENRON.COM) with any 
operational questions.  We will need to get a customer list from you at your 
convenience so that we can begin comparing to our counterparty list.  Please 
forward this list to Anna once it is ready.  Thanks

Ian,

I will have 5 guest user Id's emailed which will give you access to
EnronOnline temporarily.  I have the documentation ready for your review.
Where do you want the documentation sent?
