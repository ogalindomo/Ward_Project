Attached is the form fee agreement that we should start to use.  It is based 
upon the TFS form which is currently consistent with the manner in which the 
site will work (e.g., no more on line BETA).  Please confirm with Bob that it 
is acceptable.  Once confirmed, please use as you need.

Thanks.  If you need me, call me.  I'll check in with you in the am.
