Hi guys-

Would you mind taking a look at this CP for me.  I spoke with Aparna Rajaram 
and was told they should have a $100,000 line and be able to trade physical 
products.  At this time the profile reflects "read only" status to 
everything.  When you get a chance, please try to revisit this customer 
profile.

Thanks,

Nikki
