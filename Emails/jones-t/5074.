Bonavista Petroleum Ltd. is NOT authorized to trade US power -- restricted by 
credit.

***********************
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC -- no change to profile -- authorized 
to trade power.

NOTE:  I spoke with Massachusetts Electric Company -- they are a distribution 
company and are not FERC authorized to sell power.  So, I'm making a note 
that this CP should NOT be authorized to trade US power.
