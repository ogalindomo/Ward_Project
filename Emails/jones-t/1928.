Please prepare a draft ISDA for the following Mexican counterparty.  Our 
trader in Mexico is anxious to forward the documentation as a deal is 
apparently imminent.  He is calling on a regular basis.  Would the legal 
assistant who is assigned this task please give me a call so I can tell him 
when to expect it?

Thanks for your help.

Paul.
