Is there more to this than adding three companies?  If so, let's talk.  If 
not, take a crack at drafting and we can discuss on Monday.  If you want to 
forward the notes, I will look at them over the weekend.

		 Subject: New/Revised General Motors NDA

So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we 
either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some 
new business approaches Net Works is making with them.  We'll need to 
possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call 
and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this.
