David -

It was good to speak with you this morning.  I have attached a revised 
version of the Confidentiality Agreement with Clickpaper.com in which I have 
reflected a change in Paragraph 4 to accommodate your concerns.  If this is 
acceptable, I will arrange to have final documents signed in Houston and 
forwarded to your attention for counter-signature by Forestweb.  If, however, 
this language is insufficient to address your concerns, please let me know.

Thanks.
