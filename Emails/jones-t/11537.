In addition to the above name overlays there was a NAME CORRECTION

Name Correction        Jefferson Cocke County Utility District          
183            Public Utility District of Jefferson and Cocke Counties,
             Tennessee

The name overlays all had the proper documentation, and there are no changes 
in CP ID or BA ID numbers.  If additional details are required, please look 
at the notes tab in Global Counterparty.  Affected shortnames will change on 
Friday, May 11.  I will forward those under separate cover.

I am in the process of moving the report to a shared directory.  I apologize 
for any inconvenience this may cause.  If there is additional information 
that I can add to this abbreviated version of the report, to make it easier 
in the meantime, please reply.  I appreciate your patience.
