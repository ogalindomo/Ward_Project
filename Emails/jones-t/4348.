		 Subject: Counterparty Approval List for 10/05/00

Attached is the referenced list.  I am saying "amended-no change" because for 
Calpine, I originally had them open for power & financial, and I am not 
changing that approval, and for Nicor, I originally had them open for 
financial and shut down for power and I am not changing that approval.
