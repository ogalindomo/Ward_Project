ANR Pipeline Company is not authorized to trade U.S. power products.  The 
other CPs are fine.

ANR is not a current trading partner and is not on my FERC-approved lists.

El Paso Electric Company currently trades in the West pursuant to the WSPP.  
Since credit has rated them as a "SC", they cannot trade pursuant to the WSPP 
and must instead trade pursuant to the GTCS with collateral.  Accordingly, 
this CP must receive an override letter.
