I'm not sure.  We definitely received an approval on Lyke Corporation (dba 
Ripon Printers) but I'm not sure if that was sent to you on a different list 
as well.  Daishowa and Cariboo have since been killed.  That may be why we 
missed this one counterparty.  But I suppose it's possible we missed that 
list entirely.  Either way, that one counterparty, The Record Herald, is the 
only one I show left in a legal reviewing status.

Thanks,

Nikki

I'm not showing I looked at this list at all.  Isn't that right?

Tana-

There was one missed counterparty on this approval from credit.  Please 
review Record Herald Publishing Company from the approval below.

Thanks,
