1.  Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership is not authorized to 
trade any U.S. power products.  (We are currently in litigation with Midland 
and are not trading with this CP.) 

2.  Otter Tail Power Company -- Enron Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  
We do not have any trading agreements with this CP so it is not necessary to 
send an override letter.

3.  Florida Power Corporation and Carolina Power & Light Company -- Enron 
Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  Each of these CPs should receive an 
override letter in the form attached below.
