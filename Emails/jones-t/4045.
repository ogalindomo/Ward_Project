Attached is the final name change/merger notification report for Sept. 2000

The only addition that hasn't already been changed in the system is 
Pennzenergy Exploration & Production. L.L.C.  This name will be overlayed on 
Monday afternoon (9/25), and the  short name will be changed on the 
Pennzenergy record on Wednesday afternoon (9/27).

Records will be inactivated a week from Monday (10/2)

The other additions to the final report were cosmetic name corrections made 
during the current month that were not actual name changes.  Effective 
immediately, these corrections will appear on the report and will be included 
in the notification process as they occur.  Corrections on name changes 
received by 2:p, will be changed at 4:p that day, corrections received after 
2:p will be processed the next day.
