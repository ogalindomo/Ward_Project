After 7 long months, the stork has finally arrived!!!   My husband and I have 
been in the process of adapting a baby girl.  I am elated to inform you that 
our 14 month old bundle of joy will be permanently place in our home on the 
16th of this month.  I will be out of the office that week to get her settled 
in with her new family.
