Tana:

Andy approved the Modesto ETA letter.  Thus, please finalize with address and 
recipient information and I'll initial.  (I'm only here till about 4 pm today 
and won't be here in the morning -- I have to see my ENT before the 
conference.)  So, if you miss me, initial for me and circulate for execution.

Thanks,

Leslie
