I have a couple of revisions to EOL CP approvals:

Lower Colorado River Authority is approved to trade all US physical power 
products pursuant to the on-line GTCs.

City of Roseville is approved to trade all US physical power products 
pursuant to the on-line GTCs.

Please call me with any questions.

Regards,

Leslie
