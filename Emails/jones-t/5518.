Attached is the FINAL report for Nov 2000.  The additions to the preliminary 
report have been highlighted.

Please note that on the preliminary report for this month, Sempra Energy 
Solutions, LLC  ("Solutions") was listed under old record information to be 
inactivated on 12/01/00, and Sempra Energy Sales LLC  ("Sales") was listed as 
the new record information.  For the documentation received, this information 
was correct, HOWEVER, there was a subsequent change for which there is no 
documentation.  I have verified with the Counterparty that "Sales" was a 
fictiticious name used to distinguish the Kentucky office from the California 
office.  Through reorganization, it was decided that both offices would use 
the "Solutions" name.  Since "Solutions" already existed and "Sales" is a 
fictitious name, they had no documentation to support that change.  The 
"Sales" record has been suspended pending inactivation on 12/01.







All short name changes will be made this afternoon, approx. 1:p CST, Nov. 
22.  


Records will be inactivated on Fri afternoon, Dec. 1.


Thanks,
