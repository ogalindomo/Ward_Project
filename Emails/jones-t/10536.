In the interest of time, I have provided below the final agreement between 
Clickpaper.com and Forestweb for the streaming of news/information to 
Clickpaper.com and the microsite.  As you will note, all references to EOL 
have been removed as it was determined internally that there was no need for 
EOL to be a party to this agreement.

If you could, please print two originals of the attached, have them signed by 
an authorized officer of Forestweb and forward them to my attention.  I will 
ensure counter-signature by Clickpaper.com and will, thereafter, forward one 
fully signed original to your attention for Forestweb's files.

Please let me know if there is anything further that you should need.

Thanks for your cooperation.
