Tana,

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA 
between PG&E and ENA with a C$ confirmation (exactly like the proposed 
Southern transaction).

Please contact Chris or myself with any questions.

thanx,
