Tana,

Attached are the credit worksheets for Royal Bank of Canada and Bow River 
Trust.  As we discussed we have proposed letters of credit for the approved 
form of collateral pending further discussion with Treasury regarding funding 
impact.  We may have to move to cash margining if necessary.

Please call if you have any questions.

Bill
