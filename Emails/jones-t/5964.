Derek,

I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex 
A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the 
confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch.

I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex, 
but I feel there is still missing the Annex A, as it is  refferred in the 
Confirmation Form as part of the terms and conditions of the  transaction. 
Please confirm.
