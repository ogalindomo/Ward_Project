Hey, Tana,

I have a quick question.  I need your expert opinion...

I am about to order a bedskirt from Chambers and of the 3 they offer with
18" drops, which do you think would look best with my bed?
 Hem-Stitched, white,straight, flat look
 Gathered Cotton, white
  or, Voile Layered over Cotton, white.

Let me know what you think if you get a chance.

Also, at Linens, Unlimited on West Gray, I found a white cotton gathered
skirt that you pin on to your mattress at whatever placement you want.  It
costs $160.  The ones at Chambers are around $100., plus shipping.
