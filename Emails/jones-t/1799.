"A creative economy is the fuel of magnificence."
- Ralph Waldo Emerson

Will technological developments widen or narrow the economic disparities 
present in our world today?

The knee-jerk reaction might be to assume that these developments will widen 
the current economic disparities.  The latest technology is also the most 
expensive, and so it follows that only those who are economically secure will 
have access to it.  Those who are struggling financially will be left behind 
even further than they already were.  

What we need is a creative economy to fuel our magnificence as a society.  
Enron Investment Partners seeks to deliver on this by giving small, 
minority-owned businesses a much-needed push in the direction of financial 
stability.
