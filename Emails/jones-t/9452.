Tana, thank you for bringing this to my attention.  Samantha Boyd has also 
mentioned this to me.  I apologize - I have switched profiles Friday and my 
email group addresses did not migrate correctly.  I will revise my group list 
to reflect the suggested changes.  And again sorry for the error and any 
inconvenience it may have caused.  Thank you for your attention to this 
matter.  Regards, Keegan Farrell


Keegan, please include me (as well as all members of the team) on any 
distributions when members of the Swap Group are going to be out of the 
office.  This would include Mark Taylor, Sara Shackleton, Carol St. Clair, 
Mary Cook, Francisco Pinto Leite, Cheryl Nelson, Bob Bruce, Frank Sayre, 
Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd & Stephanie Panus.

Thanks.
