Peter,
Attached is an updated version of the Enron/Global Crossing NDA that
identifies the appropriate Global Crossing entity.  It has been cleared for
signature by our in-house counsel.  If Enron is also okay with the NDA,
please accept the changes and fax a signed copy to my attention for
signature by Global Crossing.  My fax number is 310-499-7514.  Feel free to
give me a call with any questions or comments.  I look forward to meeting
with you shortly.
Regards,
Hank
