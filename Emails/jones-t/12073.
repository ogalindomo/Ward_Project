Please find attached a copy of the Unanimous Consent of Directors for 
EnronOnline LLC, approving the appointment of Lara McKinney and Arfan Aziz, 
as requested. Please note, Deb Korkmas (ECT Resources Corp Legal dept) 
prepared and executed the document on my behalf, and I believe she will have 
the original signed document (or know of its whereabouts). 

Please contact me on +44 207 783 4414 should you have any further enquiries.

Kind regards
Heather
