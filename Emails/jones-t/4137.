Sam and I are putting together a draft ISDA for ENA and Washington 
Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.  Our form of legal opinion for 
governmental entities notes that special credit language is advisable when 
credit is involved, as in this case.

I can not find any such language, either in the form of opinion or the 
library doc.  Could anyone direct me to an ISDA we have done recently with a 
governmental entity that involved financing?  thanks, Bob
