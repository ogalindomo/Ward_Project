I don't get there until the night of May 7, so I guess no La Dolce Vita party 
for me.  Thanks for thinking of me though.  Have you got your rulers all 
sharpened up?

I forget when you are coming?  If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in 
the Asia/Pacific Group will be having his XVIII Annual La Dolce Vita Party 
which is always a great blast, and I'll secure you an invite too...let me 
know...!
