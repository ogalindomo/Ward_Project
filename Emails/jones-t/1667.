Tana, conceptually no problem with any those entities trading Australian 
power assuming they pass the credit check and are properly incorporated. (You 
might want to check the full names of Mitsui Global Precious Metals, Itocho 
Oil Exploration, IBJ-DL Financial Technology and Nippon Oil Exploration, they 
don't appear complete.)  There is a tax treaty between Australia and Japan 
hence no further tax checks required. 

I note that BHP Japan is listed. BHP is an Australian based corporation. 
Whilst there would be no Australian legal impediment I would question why 
they would be trading global products through a Japanese subsidary.
