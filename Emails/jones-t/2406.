Gentlemen, as we speak Enron's Credit and Legal teams are conversing on the 
best way to approach, either an ISDA or a Long Form Confirm, for "papering" 
the requested financial hedge.  Once Enron Credit is "comfortable" with 
Bellingham Cold Storage (BCS), Legal will prepare the necessary 
documentation, once approved by BCS/John Cameron, I will quote work up some 
July executable numbers and attempt to contact the Robert, Doug, John C.  
This will require everyone's joint efforts in order to accomplish this in 
such a short time line.  BCS and John Cameron should anticipate a call from 
either or Enron's Credit and Legal personnel.  Thanks,  John

We need numbers as soon as possible this morning -- also these must be
serious -- not notional.

I am at 771-5090.  I will be available at 784-3758 all day.  My email
follows me around so you can always get me  on email.
