KN Marketing, L.P. is NOT authorized to trade US power products.  

Not a current trading partner or FERC-authorized marketer (we trade with KN 
Marketing, Inc.)

Molly:

The credit profile for US power products was B except US East ICAP, which was 
X -- the profile for ICAP should be the same for the other power products.  
Please call me if we need to discuss.
