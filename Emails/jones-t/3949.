Subject: Terra Capital Assignment

Per conversations with Terra Industries, in order to better manage the 
relationship exposure we would like to assign the existing Financial 
Transactions with Terra Capital, Inc. to Terra International, Inc.

Please prepare assignment documents to facilitate this.

Please see below for the existing transactions and TAGG #'s that will be 
assigned.

Thank you,

Russell
