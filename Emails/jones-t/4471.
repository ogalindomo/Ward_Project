You should list "Emerging Markets" as "Global Markets" and separately list 
pulp & paper, lumber and steel under "Industrial Markets" with Julia's name

		 Subject: Online Legal Contacts

In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online 
team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we 
will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.
