Tana,


It appears that the Contracts group updated a RESTRICTED product and has 
thrown these into your work queue.  A quick fix is to add filters in product 
type for that specific product type =  US Gas Phy Index Firm non-TX <or = 1MO 
(RESTRICTED) and update all cp's pending legal review to Read.  Let me know 
if you have any questions.


Additional items in the legal work queue for Houston include the following:

James River Coal Sales Inc.
PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P.
PMI Trading, LTD
Pittston Coal Sales Corp.
Proliance Energy, LLC
Summit Natural Gas, LLP
Utah Municipal Power Agency
Western Area Power Administration-CRS
Williams Refining & Marketing, LLC

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
