As  many of you already know, Gabrielle was diagnosed with a congenital heart 
defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which means that the left side 
of her heart did not develop correctly.  Today she is undergoing the first of 
three surgeries designed to re-plumb the heart so that the right side does 
all the work.  This first step is a very dangerous and complicated 
procedure.  The second and third operations will take place at 6 months and 3 
years of age.  Fortunately, Texas Children's Hospital has the best infant 
cardiac department in the country.  

Gabrielle was taken into surgery at 8:30 a.m. and still has a few hours to 
go.  I last spoke to Jim around 2:00 p.m. and he said that things were going 
well, and that there have been no complications.  Jim and Michele wanted to 
express their gratitude for the outpouring of love and prayer.  Let's all 
keep praying and stay optimistic for the best possible outcome!
