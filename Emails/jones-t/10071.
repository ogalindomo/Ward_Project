Attached is a marked and final version of the Fee Agreement with Enron.  I 
have made a change to the payment provision such that the fee is due and 
payable upon Natsource's receipt and activation of the password and userid 
issued by Enron.  I have not used the defined term "Passwords" since this 
term include passwords established by Natsource under the initial password 
and userid issued by Enron and is not limited to the latter.

I understand this change was conceptually discussed by the business personnel 
and was found to be acceptable.  If this is the case, please present the 
attached to Natsource for signature and instruct them to forward signed 
documents to Enron for countersignature.

Thanks for your continued assistance with this matter.  If you should have 
any questions or need anything further, please let me know.
