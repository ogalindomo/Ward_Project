Randy,

It was a pleasure meeting with you and Greg yesterday.  I am looking forward 
to exploring with you both specific pricing on selected counterparties, and 
various applications for this product such as L/C substitution and hedging 
recognized MTM earnings.

 Attached please find our template non-disclosure agreement.  I will call you 
on Monday to discuss your timing on how we might proceed.



Regards,  Bruce
