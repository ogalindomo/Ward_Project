The request made for Ontario Power Generation to amend our gty by adding ENA 
for financial transactions should be cancelled.  I will work through our 
financial attys on all outgoing gtys for financial issues.  Sorry if this was 
any inconveniece to the extent you have already processed the work.   Thanks.
