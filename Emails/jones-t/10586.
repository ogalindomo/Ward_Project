Tana,

Normally I will do the immediate change and then the change is also done in 
profile manager.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

Well, I guess we could.  since we needed to do it immediately, only Stepanie 
can only do it immediately.  Do you want me to change it, or, Stephanie, 
since you've already changed it will it be already changed tomorrow so we 
don't need to do anything.  I'm so confused?!!!

Tana,

Can we accomplish that by you initiating a change to their current trading 
profile in Profile Manager ??

Per conv. a minute ago with Marcus, Christi Nicolay in the Regulatory Group 
just checked and Ontario Power Generation does not have a FERC marketing 
license.  That leaves them to buying US power only (both east & west OK).  
Please make this change immediately.

Thanks!
