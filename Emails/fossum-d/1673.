That is unclear at this time--I'll consider this and as I'm not moving for 
awhile, this may be the easy fix.  Thanks. df

Will someone residing outside of Texas be replacing you as general counsel of 
NNG?  If so, then that person could replace you.

Thanks Ann--I won't move until Summer, but am aware of this issue (Mike Moran 
reminded me that an Omaha replacement needs to be found).  I've asked our 
paralegal Bill Brown to help find likely suspects but if you have an idea let 
me know what we need to do.  Thanks.  df

Drew, Will you be moving to Houston soon?  I guess that when you do relocate 
we should find a substitute for you on the OPI director and officer slate.

I have cc: Melinda Winn on this e:mail because she is handling legal matters 
for the tax group now, and would handle the election of a replacement for you.
