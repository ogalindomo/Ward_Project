I think it is important to get estimates from the litigation group and from 
outside counsel on major matters. I am not going to lose any sleep if we dont 
get something on the Grynberg/Quinque cases from outside counsel because 
frankly there has not been a lot of activity and our fractional share of 
joint bills for matters would be relatively small.
