This will follow up on my conversation with you in the elevator a few days 
ago about the above-referenced matter.  Given Eric's departure, I mentioned 
to you  the Unit wanted to be able to help out with the usual December 
outside counsel estimated bills if you needed us.  The lesson that I have 
learned in the past is that the sooner we let outside counsel know how much 
of December's actual time you want reflected (if any) versus how much 
estimated time you want reflected, the easier it is for the law firms to get 
that done.

We're standing by to help.
