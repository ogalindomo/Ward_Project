Subject: Electronic Filing Demo

Mary Kay,

The Capitol Connection will offer the electronic filing demonstration 
following the Commission meeting on November 8, 2000, as a special FERC 
meeting live over the Internet.  We can contact Jan Butler at 3-7629 (she is 
sick today) or David Reininger or Julia Morelli at (703) 993-3100 or visit 
Capitol Connection's website at www.capitolconnection.gmu.edu if we are 
interested in viewing the demo.  The cost for the video/audio version would 
be $65 for the 1st computer connection and $15 for each additional connection 
with a maximum charge per site of $200.  Are we interested in seeing the demo?

Naomi
