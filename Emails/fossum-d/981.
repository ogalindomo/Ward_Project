Who in certificates has looked at the issues of using our compreesor turbines 
to generate electricity??
Also has anyone in Legal done any research on PUHCA issues.
I was just speaking with Bob Burleson and Rod Hayslett about these issues.  
Rod said that Danny is very interested and is considering power generation on 
the Florida system.  Do you know who from legal is on that team?
i assume there may be marketing affiliate isues also ??
