Judy Weakly and I delivered 89 stuffed Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes to 
the Omaha distribution point yesterday .  It was quite a sight to see 
thousands of gaily wrapped shoeboxes against the back wall.   Northern Border 
paid the shipping costs - thank you Northern Border!   From here the boxes 
will go to Minneapolis, and from Minneapolis they will be shipped around the 
world.  Volunteers, like you and me, will place them in the hands of precious 
children in pretty tragic circumstances, giving them a bright spot they will 
probably never forget .

Thank you so much, everyone, for your selflessness.  You just HAVE to be the 
greatest!!  J
