Subject: Capacity Options

Susan,

Per your request, I have attached a brief memo concerning capacity option 
exemptions and regulations.  If you have any questions or comments you would 
like to discuss before the 3 p.m. meeting please do not hesitate to contact 
me.  If the offer still stands, I would like to attend this afternoon's 
meeting.

Brian
