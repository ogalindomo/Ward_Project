A consideration is being given to a plan which could provide an additional 7 
reserved parking spaces for employees in the Omaha parking garage.  However, 
before we undertake any work or effort to make these spots available, we 
would like to know if there is any interest by employees to obtain a reserved 
parking space ($30/month).

Please respond back via E-mail no later than Friday, November 17.  We will 
evaluate the response and determine whether to implement the new parking plan.
