MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE



With the many organizational changes that have taken place recently, we have 
decided to cancel the P&D Facilitator training that was scheduled for Monday, 
11/13/00.  It is not likely that such training will take place before next 
year and we will keep you up to date as those plans are finalized.
