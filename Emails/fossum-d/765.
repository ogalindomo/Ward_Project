At this mornings staff meeting, Stan asked about the status of TW options 
filing,  Shelley indicated that she felt it would be on the Nov 21 st 
agenda.  The 30 days to act is up on Nov. 16th, if the FERC hasn't done 
anything aren't the tariff sheets approved as filed?? If that answer is yes,  
isn't an order after that date required to meet the SS 5 requirements??   
Just thinking about the timing-  MK
