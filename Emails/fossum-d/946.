Dear General Counsels:

I have mentioned to you that we included Dow Jones and Public Records to the 
exisiting Westlaw contract ( flat rate remains the same, but more databases 
access) in August.    It took Westlaw Accounting long time to correct Aug. 
and Sept. invoices to reflect the changes.  I apologize for the delay on this 
reporting.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions on the 
reports.  

 

Thanks,
