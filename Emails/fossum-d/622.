On November 17th we will be converting fully to the new website location for 
the Weekly Regulatory Report.  If you are having any difficulties in linking 
or pulling up this website, please advise.  The URL listed below is lengthy 
but shortens a step for you.

If this does not work, here is the shorter version that brings you to the 
site, then click on Weekly Report for the most current report.
