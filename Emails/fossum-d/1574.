Why would PGT do that????  If there was that much demand, you'd think they 
would have been able to extract a neg. rate deal for something north of max 
for a shorter term.  Maybe that shipper demanded the recourse rate.  Weird.  
By the way--good memo to Shelley on Red Rock.  df

Subject: PGT-NW expansion

Rumor on the street is that the entire 200 MMcf/d of capacity in the PGT-NW 
expansion went to one shipper who offered max. rates for 35 years.
