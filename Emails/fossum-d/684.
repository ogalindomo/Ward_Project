On Friday, November 3,  at 4:30, we will be migrating the ETS QuickPlace 
server.   The maintenance is expected to last approximately 30 minutes

What does this mean to you?

Users who access the IdeaBank or any QuickPlace discussion sites, i.e.  ETS 
Infrastructure, Program Office, ETS Standards will not be able to access them 
until the server has been brought back up.

The IdeaBank will automatically be rerouted to the new server.  However, any 
references to GTHOU-WW01P/QuickPlace  will need to be changed to 
NAHOU-LNWW01/QuickPlace.
