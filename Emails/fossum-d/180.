Please plan to attend the first ALL-EMPLOYEE SAFETY MEETING for this year in 
Room #227.  The topic is:  Domestic Violence.  The speaker is:  Mr. William 
Mulherin from the Safety & Health Council.  This will be an interesting and 
informative meeting that you won't want to miss.   Safety awards, door prizes 
& treats will also be included in the program.

Management recommends that you attend at least two safety meetings per year.  

Your name will be entered into the drawings at the end of the year for 
attending 3 and/or 4 safety meetings in 2000.  Two gift certificates will be 
presented at that time.    

SEE YOU THERE!
