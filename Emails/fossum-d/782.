Subject: Mark Schroeder - Management Meeting - San Antonio

Hello Mr Fossum, 

Unfortunately, Mark Schroeder is unable to attend the Managers Meeting in San 
Antonio due to unforeseen circumstances.  I just wanted to pass on Mark's 
apologies, because I know you were going to get together. 

Regards,


Beverley
