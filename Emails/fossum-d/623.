Please Note:

We have excluded all Transportation Service Contracts from the calculation of 
authorized limits.  While some Transportation Service Contracts have price 
risk, we currently do not have any that meet the definition of a derivative 
per FAS 133.

If there are any questions regarding this change, please contact Dan Fancler.
