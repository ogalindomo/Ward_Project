Shelley, these comments look good.  I think they properly set forth  a 
structure to provide for these items as the entire market develops not prior 
to the service availability.  Most importantly, GISB isn't the business 
driver-  others please comment.   Remember,we aren't against its a 
timing/complete evaluation of the impacts to other service that hasn't been 
dealt with.  MK

FYI - Attached are the comments that I prepared for the pipeline segment to 
submit prior to the GISB EC vote next week on partial day recall.
