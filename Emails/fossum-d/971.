FERC contacted INGAA to ask that pipelines call Dan Larcamp in the event that 
they experience any curtailments, supply shortages or other critical 
operations situations this winter.  FERC wants to hear from the pipelines and 
have some time to react before they are asked to respond in a public forum 
(particularly Congress).
