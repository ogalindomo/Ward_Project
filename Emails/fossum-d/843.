NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.
