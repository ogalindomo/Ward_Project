Guardian Pipeline said it bought five engine compressor packages totaling 
22,225 hp to provide natural gas compression on its 141-mile, 660 MMcf/d 
pipeline in Illinois and Wisconsin. It purchased the compressors from 
Compressor Systems, Inc. of Midland, TX. Combined, the compressors will be 
capable of delivering up to 750 MMcf/d of gas on Guardian. "Guardian Pipeline 
is continuing to make steady progress. This purchase agreement for a major 
equipment component keeps Guardian on track to meet its scheduled in-service 
date of November 2002," said George Hass, Guardian project manager. A final 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision on the Guardian Pipeline 
is expected by early 2001. In June, FERC issued a Preliminary Determination 
that the pipeline is in the public interest, subject to the outcome of its 
environmental review, and in July, FERC staff issued a favorable Draft 
Environmental Impact Statement on the project. In addition, the Public 
Service Commission of Wisconsin made a preliminary dete
rmination on the project in October, accepting the economics of a Wisconsin 
Gas lateral pipeline, which will connect Guardian with Wisconsin Gas' 
distribution system. Guardian will transport gas from interconnections with 
Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern, and NGPL at the Chicago hub near 
Joliet, IL, to northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin markets starting in 
November 2002. Its sponsors include CMS, WICOR and Viking Gas.
