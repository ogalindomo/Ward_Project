From a Clean Fuels standpoint I'll offer the following:

#5  This should read  Underground NGL Storage at Mt. Belvieu

#6  Natural gas purchasing (feedstock for methanol production)

#19  Isobutylene production  (we sell isobutylene to a single customer in 
addition to MTBE to several)

#20  We transport NGL's up and down the Ship Channel as well as to Texas City

I hope this helps, if not please call.
