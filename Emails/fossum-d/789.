Subject: FW: Texas version of Survivor


We're told top aides at the Bush campaign headquarters in Austin were
in hysterics upon hearing that network television is developing a
Texas version of "Survivor," the popular TV show.

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas,
Houston, San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and
Lubbock, driving a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads: "I'm for
Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns."
If anybody finishes, they win.
