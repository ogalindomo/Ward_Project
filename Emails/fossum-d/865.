Late Wednesday, FERC issued a notice of staff conference discussing issues 
pertinent to Order No. 637.  This is the second of three public conferences 
to be held on January 31 at 1:00 p.m. to be held at FERC's offices. Panel 
Participants will be debating issues concerning the market consequences of 
transactions between pipelines and affiliates.  Since parties will not be 
making an oral presentation, it is requested that written comments be 
submitted to FERC by January 5, 2001 to 1) provide input on how to structure 
the discussion; 2) identify issues and examples to foster a meaningful 
dialog; and 3) suggest questions the staff moderator may wish to pose to the 
panel.  Attached is the Notice.
