Would we be better off letting the trade associations fight this one out?  I 
haven't read the pleading yet, but from your description, I wouldn't be 
surprised if all of them oppose it--AGA included.  DF

Subject: Complaint Against Gas Sellers to Reimpose Price Caps - Docket No 
RP01-223

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.
