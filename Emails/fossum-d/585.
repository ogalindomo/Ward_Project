Begining today the Wall Street Journal no longer has individual addresss 
labels on them.  Consequently we will distribute them the same way we do the 
Omaha World Herald.  There is a sheet at the Front Desk that you need to 
check off your name when you pick up your copy.  If you would like Londee to 
deliver your copy, please let us know.  

Thanks for your cooperation.
