Subject: Book Structure Diagrams

Melinda

Attached are the book structure diagrams that outline the proposed book 
structure for ET&S.  I have also attached the document that we reviewed with 
the storage team last week.  I will bring copies of the documents to the 2:00 
meeting tomorrow for review (Drew please print a copy).
