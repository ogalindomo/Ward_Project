Subject: Preliminary Oklahoma Agenda

In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in 
a format of questions and answers.
However, as you will see, the questions I thought of got kinda long- but I 
think we need answers for all of them. 
One thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in 
with the first two questions as I've listed. 
Please provide me your thoughts asap.   MK
