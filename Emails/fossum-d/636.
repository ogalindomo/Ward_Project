Effective Monday, November 6, Stan Horton's weekly staff meeting will be 
expanded to include representatives from ETS marketing, regulatory, legal and 
operations in order to facilitate the communication and discussion of key 
commercial matters.  This revised staff meeting format will eliminate the 
need for Dan McCarty's and Julia White's separate Monday morning staff 
meetings.

With the expansion of the attendee list, it is important that reports be 
concise and focused on new developments that have not been previously 
communicated.

These meetings will begin at 9:15AM and are expected to conclude by 10:30AM.
