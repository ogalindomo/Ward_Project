Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential=

Alternatively, you can also access the site from Enron's homepage, under th=
e=20
Information & Services section, go to the link called "EnTelligence".

To view deal data, a user will need to submit an eRequest and select either=
:=20
Trader, Manager, or Sr Manager security.  I would also recommend to add the=

following applications to your eRequest: Dow Jones Interactive (DJI), and=

Live Link.  DJI is to be able to view market information and Live Link is o=
ur=20
desktop documentation system which enables the user to view a contract from=

your computer.

The following attachment is a sampling of a Market Penetration report=20
