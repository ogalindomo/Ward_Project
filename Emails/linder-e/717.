Group,

Our discussion forum notes as a group are significantly improved in the past 
3 weeks in many areas.  I believe communication in the group at shift changes 
is improving and is quite good in general.  However, there is always room for 
more improvement.  Specifically, other traders in the group and on the floor 
would benefit from more detailed information regarding outages.  Please try 
to include the reason for a plant derate as well as the ETR when a unit is 
lost.  I would also highly recommend notifying the cash desk in the region 
affected by the outage, either by email or verbally.  An important outage was 
recently missed by both the real-time group and another cash desk on the 
floor.  Real-time had ready access to the information concerning the outage 
but did not pass that information on to others in the group at the shift 
change or others on the floor.  In this case, such poor communication simply 
made us look foolish.  We work hard for (and justly deserve) the solid 
reputation we have on the floor.  Let's make sure we do the little things to 
maintain it. 

Again, keep up the good work.
Bill
