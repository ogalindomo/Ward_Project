You guys had a busy night last night and did a good job of handling El Paso 
and getting the reports done.  However, we were not flat this morning in 
Enpower (long 1600 mws in NP, and short 192 in SP), and because we were not 
flat in California, the Enpower to Caps report was incorrect.  Variances 
listed as explained in the Enpower to CAPS report were not.  Your night note 
says however:

CAPS Position Manager:
Flat for both days.

Please make sure you have checked the position manager and updated your night 
note.
Thanks,

Bill
