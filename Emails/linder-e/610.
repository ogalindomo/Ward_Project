Good Morning,

Mike Purcell has accepted a position in the Volume Management group and will 
be joining that team effective April 23rd. 

Mike has worked on the Preschedule desk for over a year scheduling the 
Northwest, and has done a fine job representing Enron to our counterparties. 
His technical ability and grace under pressure will be missed as we roll into 
the summer months! 

Please join me in wishing Mike well in his new position.
