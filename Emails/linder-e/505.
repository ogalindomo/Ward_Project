We have parking with PNM for off-peak on Monday.  The energy schedule is as 
follows.  The energy is at 4C but you should be able to move it to PV with 
PNM if you ask nicely.  We will split the upside over $35 with ST SW via 
annuity.  Please make all transmission purchases or other sales under their 
book.  

Deal number on the buy from PNM is #581199.

The shape of this length is:

HE1 50
HE2 50
HE3 50
HE4 50
HE5 45
HE6 20
HE23 35
HE24 50

Day total is 350.

Thanks
Bill
