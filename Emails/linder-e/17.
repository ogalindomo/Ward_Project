The new electronic expense reporting system does not recognize you as an 
employee or approving manager.   Until we get this resolved I will not be 
able to submit an electronic expense report for you.   The system will not 
allow me to submit an E-Request in your name so you will need to do so as 
follows:

Go to:
Enron Homepage
IT Central
E-Request
Corporate Login
Update Access Acct.
Click "OK" if your name appears as the requestor
Applications
Enter "XMS"
Enter any additonal info as requested.



Thanks,

Kathy
