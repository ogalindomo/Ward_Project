Either way.  Just let us know when so that we can either do it,  or monitor 
to make sure that the books are not impacted.

Thanks

Not yet.  They will need to be moved once we get sign-offs from the right 
people.  Would you rather we had them moved systematically or should we go 
through the Book Admins?

Does this mean they are being moved systematically?

Is anyone handling this Clinton Energy/EES assignment?  All deal nos. on the 
attachment are still booked between ENA and Clinton.  They will be moved to 
EES and RMT.

Thanks,
Joe
