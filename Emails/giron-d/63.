Preliminary Summary Sheets were handed out yesterday afternoon for your 
review.  If needed, the OA group will be more than happy to reclassify 
variances(provided data such as forms, FRED's, etc. were provided by April 
30th) to the correct functional group until Thursday, May 3.

Due to issues which have arisen in the past regarding reclassifying variances 
the day before, or, in some cases, the day of the OA meeting, guidelines are 
being set to avoid the confusion of having multiple copies of the Summary 
Sheets handed out during the monthly meeting.  The final OA packet will be 
delivered on Friday, May 4.  If there are any questions, please feel free to 
call me @ 3-3954.  Thank you.
