Effective May 6, 2001, New Hire Orientation will go from a day program to 
half a day. The New Hire Orientation will start at 8:00 am and end at 12:00 
pm. The new hires will no longer be given lunch. This change was initiated as 
a result of cost cutting measures. 

We will be distributing the Inside Track at Sally Beck's next staff meeting 
scheduled for 5/14/01. This is an additional tool you can use to integrate 
the employee to your business unit. The Inside Track is a supplement to the 
handouts the new hires receive at orientation. It contains: general 
information, Windows 2000, Microsoft Outlook, PRC process and the business 
unit training expectations. We suggest personally greeting and delivering the 
Inside Track and taking your new hire out to lunch. If this is not possible 
we recommend sending a representative. We feel this would be a great way to 
welcome your new hire to Enron and your business unit. Please contact your 
Human Resources representative if you have any question. 

Regards
Frank
