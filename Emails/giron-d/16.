Subject: RE: Star VPP

Met with Pam and here is the deal.  Pam wants the P&L for the April deals to 
show up in May GL.  What I suggested to her was that rather than do anything 
for the deals in risk or Portfolio that Pam defer the P&L on her company and 
release it the next month.  This keeps things normal in our worlds and Pam 
controls when she sees the P&L on her company.  She has agreed to do this.

There will be a new twist starting in July.  Starr is supposed to become 3rd 
party and the payment date is supposedly two months after the fact.  Pam is 
checking with legal to see if there is to be a complete unwind and rebooking 
because of structure changes to make the deal 3rd party or if we can just 
change the counterparty on the deals.  I'm sure we will be the last to know 
as usual.
