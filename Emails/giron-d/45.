Subject: Gas Trading Audit Notification


The Gas Trading Audit is scheduled to begin May 11, 2001 and is expected to 
take approximately two to three months to complete.  The audit will be 
executed by Arthur Andersen and led by Kate Agnew.

We will schedule an opening meeting with you the week of May 7, 2001 to 
discuss audit scope and any concerns or suggestions you may have.

The objective of the audit will be to determine whether procedures and 
controls exercised over activities are adequate and operating effectively.  

Results of the audit will be discussed with you and other appropriate 
personnel both during the audit and at the audit closing meeting. 

We will endeavor to conduct this audit in a manner that will minimize 
interruption of your normal business activities and we look forward to 
working with you and your personnel. Please call me at x5-4554 if have any 
questions.
