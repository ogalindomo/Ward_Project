Subject: Template for pipeline data 

Privileged & Confidential 
Prepared for Counsel 

Attached is a spreadsheet containing a template of the data 
for the INGAA study of affiliate prevelance on pipelines. 
The spreadsheet is in Excel 95 format.? Please get back to 
me if you need another format. 

The spreadsheet has three tabs.? The first is for the 
pipeline capacity data an a conversion factor between Dth/d 
and Mcf/d.? The second is for data on the primary holders of 
capacity.? I have added a field for the DUNS number of the 
shipper and agent to assist in matching shippers across 
pipeline companies. The third sheet contains the capacity 
release data.? I decided to separate out the capacity 
release data from the primary shipper data so that we can 
examine whether results are sensitive to different 
assumptions about capacity release. 

If you have any questions or comments, please give me a call 
at 202-833-5208.? --jrm
