Hi John:

Miles and Knippa just came back from visiting Kern River and gave me a new 
delivery point for this project.  We want to reprice the deal at OPAL.  I am 
attaching a small spreadsheet with a one year snapshot of monthly MMBtus for 
repricing it.  I would appreciate it if you send me the new gas price as soon 
as you get a chance.

Hope everything is going well.

Maria
