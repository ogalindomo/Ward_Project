"All:At long last, we have executed the Pepperell tolling deal, which commences Jan 1, 2001."
Attached is the final confirm for the deal.
I will be scheduling a plant tour and meeting with the appropriate folks to pin down logistics and communication protocols.
Please give me a call if you'd like to discuss.
ThanksJohn
