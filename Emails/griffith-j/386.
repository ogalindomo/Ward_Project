John,
There is a re-launch of the Coast chair at the Milan Fair. It is by Magis.
This version is plastic blow-moulded ( not the original wood chair for the
Coast Restaurant)

Some of the originals recently came up for auction.

Patsy,

I just talked to Totemdesign and they said that Magis doesn't produce the
Coast chair.  He thought that it was only produced for a restaurant, is
that true?  If not, who produces the Coast chair.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

John Griffith
