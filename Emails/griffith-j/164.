If you have not already done so, please correct your new work location 
information in the "People Finder" as follows:


Go to the Enron Home Page

 Under Information & Services click on eHRonline - ehronline.enron.com

 Enter your User ID (your Employee number - if you do not know what your 
Employee # is, ask me)
 and your Password 

 Click on Work Contact Info and change your location

 Click on Save Changes

 Click on Exit

The PeopleFinder feeds off this info, so if you do not correct it, persons in 
the company cannot readily find you.

Any questions, ask me.
