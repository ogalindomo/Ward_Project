Attached is a revised draft of the Schedule.  The only changes are (1) Part 4 
paragraph (g) -- Forum For the Arbitration And Selection Of 
Arbitrators--Houston, Texas was changed to New York, New York and (2) a 
paragraph (q) was added to Part 5.  I apologize for the lack of machine 
black-line but it would not compare write for some reason.
