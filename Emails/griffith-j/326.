Hey, I made this silly animation after seeing performance art/music/dance
troupe Fischerspooner last Sat, but I didn't have my camera. Mr. Hughes was
kind enough to host it on his site in a secret place. So the only way you
can see it is to click this link:

.html

It takes a few minutes to download, but I think it's worth it.
