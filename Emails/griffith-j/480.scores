"Hi John,I've attached workbooks that compare implied volatility from market data to ENA curves for June, October, December contracts."
But I'm not sure that I have the most current skew table.
"For the attached workbooks I just took last months table and rolled the contracts up a month, so what was May-01 became June-01, etc."
Have you made any other adjustments to the skew table?
I'd be happy to come up and talk about these files with you if you want?
Thanks.
