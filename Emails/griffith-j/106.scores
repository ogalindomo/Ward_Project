John--Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
I am available to meet Wed or Thurs (20th or 21st)--why don't you see if Greg is available any time before 1:00 either of those two days?
I will be on vacation this Friday and all of next week.
(That is if you two haven't already met about this).

There are basically 3 columns in the model that need to be changed.
Let me know when you want to get together to make the change and run parallel.
Thanks.
