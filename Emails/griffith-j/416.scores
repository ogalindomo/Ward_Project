"John,For a down and out put, I put the following as an approximation for our understanding purpose."
a down and out put with barrier B < strike Kis overestimated byA put at struck at K - a put struck at B - (K-B)*digital put strike at B.I ploted the barrier put (blue line)  versus the approximation (red line) as function of the barrier.
The true barrier option has zero payoff whenever there is a touch down the barrierduring the lifetime of the option.
Therefore it goes to zero much faster thanabove approximation when B -> K.See the spreadsheet for more details.
