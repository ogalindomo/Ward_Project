"John, Doug called me with a question regarding the Historical Henry Hub price: Are those monthly gas prices as of NYMEX contract expiration date?"
"For example, Jan. 2001 contracts expire on 12/31/2000."
He wants to make sure that the 12/31/2000 gas price is actually for Jan. 2001 contracts.
Thanks!
