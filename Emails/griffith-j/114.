Eric (Moon) and John, attached are the tickets for the physical part of the 
Preston VPP deal.  Please work with Will Kelly to have them entered into 
Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's 
spot production?
