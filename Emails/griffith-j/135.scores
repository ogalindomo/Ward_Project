John and Angie this was the best Christmas yet.
Thank you for the VeryStylish Suitcase.
I think I will set the standard for travel these days.
Ittook me 12 hrs to get home from Houston.
"Icy roads, yuck,  my normally 2hr30 min trip from San Angelo took 6 hrs."
Once again Thanks for making mine &Kerans Christmas so Wonderful.
