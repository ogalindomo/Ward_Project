"John,The LNG guys wanted to look at some rough economics for building pipe."
Maybe you can point me in the right direction.
They would like to know how much it would cost to build a line from Wrens to Transco.
Approx 90 miles.
"Additionally, they would like to know the cost of building a line from Elba going under the river twice to Plant McIntosh owned by Southern Co."
This is particularly interesting because the rate would be approximately $.22 for a backhaul on IT but we could get a discount if threaten to bypass.
Knowing the economics could help steer us or Southern Co. on how much of a discount to ask for.
Let me know.
Thanks.
