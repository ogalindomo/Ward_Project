SENT FOR ANGELA DAVIS:

Attached are the clean and blackline versions of the final El Paso documents.

With respect to the Schedule to the Master Agreement, the clean version is 
attached, but there is no blackline version.  The only two changes were the 
removal of the draft date and the revision of the signature block for 
Mesquite.
