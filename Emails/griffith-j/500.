You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm 
currently working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by 
Cap Gemini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess 
and Enron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around 
Europe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice 
place to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a 
challangening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our 
house and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it 
all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!
