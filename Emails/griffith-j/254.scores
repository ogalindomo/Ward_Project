"From now on, we will be going to the wellhead group in order to price out all of our wellhead supply."
Our main contact is John Grass.
"John is the person whom we contact, and it is up to him to bring in someone from origination [Gary Bryan, Linda Roberts, Jill Zivley] or not, and he is the person who goes to the structuring group to get us our physical premium or discount."
"When it comes time to write up an excess contract or discuss/negotiate the excess pricing with the producer, our contact is John, and he will coordinate [with legal and origination] the discussions between ENA and the producer...of course, Tricia and I will be involved."
