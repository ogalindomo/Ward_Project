Hi, John,

How are you?  Doug told me this morning that the Indeck Corinth Project 
(which we worked on last October) has come back.  He needs to update the 
following curves from Feb. 2001 to Jul. 2015:

1. NYMEX Gas Curve
2. Basis Differential ANR and CNG North CG.  

I am attaching the file you sent me last time for your reference.  

Also, you provided us the historical Henry Hub price till last October.  
Could you please give me the historical prices for the most recent three 
months?  I am also attaching that file for your convenience.  

Thanks a lot!
