"Unfortunately we have been unable to reach closure on the third party conditions, namely the ISRA and Bayonne consents, to our Transaction Agreement with El Paso."
We have therefore negotiated an extension of the deadline.
The terms of the extension include a non-refundable deposit to be paid to us by El Paso under certain circumstances and an extension to 22-Feb.  Hopefully the extension will allow sufficient time for these two remaining conditions to be satisfied.
This extensio is expected to be finalized tomorrow.
