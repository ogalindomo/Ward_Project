Thanks for the update.  However, the volumes have changed a bit.  That's my 
fault -  I didn't send them to you.  Not a huge change, but here they are:

Jan  24,644
Feb 22,259
Mar 24,644
Apr 23,849
May 24,644
Jun 23,849
Jul 24,644
Aug 24,644
Sep 23,849
Oct 24,644
Nov 23,849
Dec 24,644

I doubt this will change the notional price, but let me know.
