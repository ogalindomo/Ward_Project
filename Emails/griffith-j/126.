Subject: Mahonia Series X Bond


Attached is a re-draft of the bond form changing the effective date to 
December 28, 2000.  I do not anticipate any further changes.  Please share 
this with your attorneys for their review.  I need attorney opinion letters 
(including the consent to photocopy letters) in hand no later than the 
afternoon of December 27 to make the closing the next morning.  Please call 
with any questions.  Thanks for all of your help on this!
