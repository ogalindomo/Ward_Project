"John:We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there are a couple of issueswe need to resolve with Paulo."
We should have a version ready for your testing by the end of this week.
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

You may easily change it back to C style by using the replace function in MS-Word or from any other editor.
