"Sandy, we are still finalizing the contract and expected volumes with Cabot Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation for the two Terrebonne Parish deals referenced above, but we expect to enter into a long term deal prior to the end of December."
Would you please re-confirm that the notional pricing set forth in your 11/13/2000 memo for the two Cabot Terrebonne Parish deals is still valid for 5 years firm out of January 2001 for 80% of the volumes cited in my original request .
Thanks.
