John and Angie this was the best Christmas yet.  Thank you for the Very
Stylish Suitcase.  I think I will set the standard for travel these days.  It
took me 12 hrs to get home from Houston.  Icy roads, yuck,  my normally 2hr
30 min trip from San Angelo took 6 hrs.  Once again Thanks for making mine &
Kerans Christmas so Wonderful.
