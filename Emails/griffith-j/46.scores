Attached is a revised draft of the Schedule.
"The only changes are (1) Part 4 paragraph (g) -- Forum For the Arbitration And Selection Of Arbitrators--Houston, Texas was changed to New York, New York and (2) a paragraph (q) was added to Part 5."
I apologize for the lack of machine black-line but it would not compare write for some reason.
