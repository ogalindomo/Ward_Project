Just to let you know. Fraud just called me about the case. they have received 
the paperwork and they are ready to credit the full amount to the account 
however instead I 'm going ot debit new account for $4504.30.

And tomorrow fraud will credit new account for the same amount.

This way we do not have to open the old account. In other words we trying to 
minimixe exposure as possible and follow procedures.
again your account will be debited only temp.

I wanted to share that with you in case you see it on your statement.
any questions please call me
yours, ameer.
