John - thanks for the kind words about Colorforms.? It was a lot of fun 
putting together and the feedback so far has been very complimentary - 
they've already run out of the color brochures so people must be interested 
in learning more.? Thanks for coming to the opening and supporting the show.? 
It means a lot to have friends believe in my projects.? 

I haven't seen the Core show yet but am looking forward to it.? What did you 
think?? I heard that Jessica's piece is real nice.

I look forward to seeing you two soon - maybe we could talk about DJ 
equipment then.? BTW, do you still have my Anokha CD.? I was looking for it 
the other day and couldn't find it.? Not a big deal if you don't.? I'll just 
pick up another copy.

Take care,

Baloy, Grils Baloy
