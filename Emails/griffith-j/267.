Jeremy,

Each day, we receive a report that shows the movement of the position's gamma 
with a change in the underlying (a gamma slide).  We would like to see how 
difficult it would be to see the same with vega (a vega slide).  Also, there 
is a report that shows totals for all the greeks by month.  Could you put a 
total line at the bottom of this report?  Please let me know of the 
difficulty of these changes. Thanks.

John
