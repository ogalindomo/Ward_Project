Subject: Fw: Security Alert




Due to the high number of attacks on women in secluded parking lots the
city of Melbourne, Australia opened the world's first all female parking lot.
Even the attendants and security staff working the lot are all female in
a further effort to create a comfortable and safe atmosphere.
Attached is a picture of this one and only parking lot.
