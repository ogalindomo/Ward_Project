Matt, if you're strapped for cash I could maybe send you some, but I'm
really strapped right now.  Put a bathroom in my house and I'm trying to pay
that off along with other things that are hurting me financially.  Let me
know.  I figured you were a big shot down there, I thought $500 would be
pocket change to you?
