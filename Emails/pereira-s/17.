Subject: Math Explorations


Dear Class Parents, 

The class will have their last Math Explorations class this Friday from 10  
until 11. ?Two of the volunteers are unable to be there so we need two  
substitutes. ?Is anyone interested??It is fun and no preparation is  
necessary. ?It is a great way to get to know your child's classmates and to  
see how your child interacts with the class. 

Email me or call me asap, please. ?My phone number is 713-661-6422. 

Thanks, 

Margaret Pierce
