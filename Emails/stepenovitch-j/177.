Kingwood Forest seemed to have played tough except for a few.  Thanks for 
keeping the play moving.  The last few groups got rained on some but we all 
finished before darkness set in.  Greg, at least you didn't need you night 
vision goggles.

The next tournament is at Kingwood Forest - The Lake Course.  Enter early - 
This is another opportunity to play a great course. See you there!


If you finished in the top three in your flight or won a closest to the pin 
or long drive contest and haven't gotten your money, please contact me.
thanks
