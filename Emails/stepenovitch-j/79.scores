Below is asummary of the expectations and conclusions reached.
"Non-Firm Energy Sales:Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell non-firm hourly energy to acustomer as an agreement for Duke to sell/deliver energy to the designateddelivery point and the customer, ENRON, to purchase/receive this energy atthe designated delivery point with ENRON taking the risk of obtainingtransmission paths beyond the designated delivery point and completingrequired tags correctly."
"After a non-firm energy schedule has begun and anew official TLR event occurs which results in curtailing the schedule,Duke considers this a Force Majuere event and ENRON will only be billed forthe energy delivered."
"Take or Pay Energy Sales:Duke Power regards a verbal commitment to sell Take or Pay energy to acustomer as an agreement for  the customer, ENRON, to purchase this energyat the designated delivery point with ENRON taking all risks and acceptingto purchase all energy scheduled."
"ENRON expressed the desire to develop  a strong relationship with Dukebuilt on conducting business ""the right way""."
The ENRON Real-time DeskManagement is committed to this desire and are our contacts for futureproblems and concerns.
