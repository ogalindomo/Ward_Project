Joe -
Thanks for the Flowers!  My question is more for how you are doing . . .  I 
keep
leaving your number here at work which is why I have not called.  In fact I 
even
deleted the last email you sent me so I have lost it completely.

You know if you ever need a break - I am only 3 hrs. and you are more than
welcome to come visit.

Talk to you soon -
