There will be a little soiree at my place around 7:00 this Saturday night 
before the Enron Christmas party.  Anyone is welcome to show up, so if I 
missed anyone, sorry.  Cocktails & hors d'oeuvres will be served.  Just bring 
yourself and your date (if you have one).  I'll have beer, wine and some 
other various alcoholic beverages.  Live entertainment will be provided by 
Big Daddy Kayne.
I live on the corner of Fannin & Capitol at the St. Germain.  Go in the walk 
through gate (code is 7890), at the end of the hallway, veer left to the 
elevator and up to #414.
