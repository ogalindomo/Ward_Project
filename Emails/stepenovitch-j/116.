Kayne,

Rebecca brought it to my attention that I got the NY indices reversed.  The 
following is the correct full list:

New York - 
 going into PJM (selling to) - NYPP-E
 going out of PJM (buying from) - NYPP-W

First Energy - PJM-CEI interface

APS (Allegheny) - PJM-APS interface

Internal - 
 DPL - PJM-Wescosvi
 others - PJM-Western Hub   (except offset to Day Ahead)

VEPCO - PJM-Virginia Power

Sorry about all the emails, thanks again -
