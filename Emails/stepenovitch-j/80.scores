"As many of you have already noticed, this year Enron will be closing its offices on Monday, January 15 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day."
"This is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has decided that we will continue to do so in the future."
Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our employees.
