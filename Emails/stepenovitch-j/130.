Hey you,

Well i'm really glad I decided to give you a call tonight.  It was really
nice to talk to you.  I do miss you and I am glad you didn't end up getting
married!!!!!  I'm really sorry I was such a spaz back then.  I guess I was
just scarred.  I can honestly say I'm over that.  I really like talking to
you.  I only wish you lived closer.  Maybe someday, right!  Well sweetie, I'm
gonna try to get to bed now.  I wish you could see the smile on my face.
Well i'll send you a picture of me in flight attendant training, just incase
you forgot what i looked like.  However, my hair is longer now but you get
the idea.

talk to you soon
smooches
trina
