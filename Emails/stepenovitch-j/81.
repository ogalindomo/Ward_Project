Several of us are attempting to determine the number of options we will 
receive.  

The following is an excerpt from an E-speak discussion with Cindy Olson 
regarding the new Enron Option Plan effective Dec. 29, 2000.


The number of options will be based upon a Black-Scholes value. 

Black-Scholes is based upon a number of factors, including the stock price, 
the risk-free rate of return, the term of the stock options, 
and the general movement of Enron common stock as compared to the general 
stock market. 
The Black-Scholes value for Enron stock options is determined monthly. 

As of October 1, 2000, the Black-Scholes value for Enron stock options was 
$31, for seven-year options.

To estimate the number of options you might receive, divide 25 percent of 
your annual base salary by the Black-Scholes 
value for Enron stock.


Therefore we must find out the year end or Dec. Black-Scholes value for ENE.  
See if you can find it on the internet.
