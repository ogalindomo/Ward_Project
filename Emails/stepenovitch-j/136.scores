Joe -Thanks for the Flowers!
My question is more for how you are doing .
.

I keepleaving your number here at work which is why I have not called.
In fact I evendeleted the last email you sent me so I have lost it completely.
You know if you ever need a break - I am only 3 hrs.
and you are more thanwelcome to come visit.
Talk to you soon -Ang
