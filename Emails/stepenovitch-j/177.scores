Kingwood Forest seemed to have played tough except for a few.
Thanks for keeping the play moving.
The last few groups got rained on some but we all finished before darkness set in.
"Greg, at least you didn't need you night vision goggles."
The next tournament is at Kingwood Forest - The Lake Course.
Enter early - This is another opportunity to play a great course.
See you there!
