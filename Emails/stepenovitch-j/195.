I have revised the Nepool Losses calculator (there was a change in my 
logic).  Please use the attached spreadsheet (or the website tool)
to record the losses that need to be added to ALL purchases from Nepool.  

I am aware that the OASIS/TAG volume might be greater than this amount due to 
rounding, but the purchases should be recorded as calculated
above and the transmission left un-routed.  Please do NOT round up the 
purchase to agree with the OASIS request.

Thanks,

Rebecca
