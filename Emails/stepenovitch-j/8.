Good Morning Derek,

I just wanted to thank you for being such a good friend.  I really need
someone to talk to  and you were there for me!  I 'll never forget
that........  Anyway, I will call Mr. Rustay first thing this morning.
Thank you again for the number.

She did call me last night and I took the "HIGH" road like you said and
everything you said was going to happen did.  She is not coming back here!!
I'll let you know what Mr. Rustay says about my situation.  Thanks again
for everything.  You truly are a great friend.

-Joe Step

Joe,

This is the name and number of the attorney we talked about and the name of
the person referring you (Jenn, who works with me, is George's future
daughter-in-law).  Hope this helps - keep me posted buddy.
