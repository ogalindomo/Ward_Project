It's that time of year...........Rodeo Cook - Off.


I have received 50 tickets for the Enron Booth for this Friday OR Saturday 
night.  Each ticket will allow two people into the booth...PLEASE remember 
that you WILL have to have an invitation to get into the booth.  Also 
remember that the booth only holds 130 ppl so if you do come and they tell 
you the booth is full please be patient and you will eventually get in the 
booth.

There will be food, drinks and music provided in the booth and it will be a 
great time.  So please try and make it out to the cook - off.  There will be 
a group of us from the Power Desk who will be representing our team:


Thursday Night
Stephanie Piwetz
Kim Hundl


Friday Night
T.Jae Black
Gretchen Lotz
Rhonda Denton
Sharen Cason



Should you be interested in the tickets please come see me ASAP.  THESE 
TICKETS WILL BE HANDED OUT ON A FIRST COME BASIS.  Remember that I only have 
50 and each person will receive only ONE so that the majority of the group 
will have a chance.  

Hope to see you there!!
