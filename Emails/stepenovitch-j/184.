Subject: New Plant Output Combination Web Pages


Greetings,

Two new web pages have been created showing the most economical power outputs 
and run costs for the New Albany plant and for the three Allegheny Plants 
(Lincoln, Wheatland and Gleason).  To access these pages, click on the links 
on the East Power Portal page under the Genco tab.  The old pages with TVA 
and Midwest Peakers are no longer available.

Please contact me for any questions or comments.
