As a follow-up to our ENA Vision and Values committee meeting yesterday 
afternoon, attached is a quick recap. 

As discussed, you are encouraged to share this information with your 
respective groups to further enhance communication of the Vision and Values 
initiatives and to elicit feedback from your colleagues.

For those of you who were not able to attend the meeting, please feel free to 
contact me if you would like to hear more details about any of the topics 
discussed.  My extension is 3-9964.
