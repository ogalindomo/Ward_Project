Per our conversation, attached is a document containing Kim Theriot's review 
of processes currently in place and identification of areas which need 
addressing.  I will be scheduling a meeting with Kim to thoroughly review her 
findings and implement an action plan.  If you questions or particular areas 
of concern after your review, please let myself or Kim know.

Thanks,
Leslie
