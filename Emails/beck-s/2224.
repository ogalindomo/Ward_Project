The "judges" are happy to announce that Colin Tonks is the winner of the $250 
EnTelligence Tag Line Contest.  Of Colin's submissions, two ideas were 
expanded upon and resulted in the following tag line :


   EnTelligence...Smarter Prospecting.  Online.  Worldwide.

Congratulations to Colin for providing the catalyst that resulted in a 
unique, "catchy", concise, and meaningful tag line for our strategic effort.

Thanks to all who participated in our contest.  We received over 80 
submissions making a decision on only one winner a real challenge.

Please pass this announcement along to your staff and others who 
participated.  Thank you.

Mary, Avril, Chris, and Richard
