To the Nuclear Team--

These are very telling time sheets.  Please ask yourself which of the line 
items
 could be eliminated
 could be automated
 could be used as a lever to develop an industry standard
 represent low hanging fruit....

Tom,

Per our conversation a week or so ago, I am forwarding a file to you which 
provides the hours worked during the month of May for each activity performed 
in the confirmation process.  These hours are for multiple RC's across the 
various functions that are in Energy Operations.  The hours are provided by 
the people responsible for the RC's; however, in many cases are rough 
estimates.  The data provided is directionally correct.

The excel file attached has several tabs.  When you open the file you should 
at the confirmation tab.

If you have any questions, need any clarification or would like to set up a 
time for us to walk you through the information, please call me at ext. 39641 
or Shari Mao at ext. 33859.

James Scribner

James,

Attached is a spreadsheet that highlights the number of hours that are spent 
on activities per RC.  I've only created custom views for Risk Management, 
Confirmations, and Settlements (VM and LO are gas specific, and the other 
functions are deemed non-Energy Operational core processes) 



Let me know if you have any questions about the data.

Thanks,
Shari
