I have been on jury duty since Tuesday this week - I had Patti call Chris 
today and let him know that I would get back with him next week.  I will keep 
you posted as I have time to focus on that next week.  Thanks for following 
up!  --Sally

Sally:

What is to become of Chris Hoyle?  There is no doubt that his interviewers 
liked him, but will he be extended a full-time offer by any of the groups?

Thank you!
