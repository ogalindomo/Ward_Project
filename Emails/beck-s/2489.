In recognition of all the hard work put in by Enron's Y2K Team, the 
unfortunate timing of the Y2K bug, and the ultimate success of our Y2K 
program, we will be holding a belated millennium rollover celebration at the 
Cadillac Bar on Friday, March 24, 2000.  Spouses are welcome.  Please see the 
attached invitation for details.

Hope to see you there!
