Dear Milind, Heidi,

I haven't heard from you in a while and thought I'd drope you a line.  I 
heard today that there are some people from India who have come to Houston to 
learn about VAR as they are planning to start trading around our assets there 
(Anshuman Srivastav/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shubh 
Shrivastava/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao@ECT, 
Rajesh Sivaraman/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Amr 
Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT).

Could you fill me in on the status?

Thanks
