I feel I already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to Brent for 
the last few months- but I realise I have been impolite in not organising a 
call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to Houston.

Additionally Brent, Shona and I have spent some excellent time on the subject 
of Internal Control Enivronment / Operational Risk / Doorstep and I wanted to 
agree potential next steps with you.
Do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?

Regards

Mike
