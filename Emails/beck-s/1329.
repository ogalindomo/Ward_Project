Subject: Update on review work on feeds

Debbie

Just to update you I am working with the above people to complete two things :

Attendance of the daily conference call to assess process and timing 
compliance - Hugo

Documentation of the end to end business and IT process flows and timing and 
handoffs within that - Doug and Simon's representative from IT ( timing of 
delivery and scope of report to be completed )

I will revert shortly

Mike
