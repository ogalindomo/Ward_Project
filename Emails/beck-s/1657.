I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

Mike
