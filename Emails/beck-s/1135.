We discussed all of the above items in detail.  We also discussed providing 
the information already gathered for the Strategies and this will be brought 
to the next meeting.  There were several discussions regarding the current 
state of daily inventories and Jim Martel was to schedule a meeting regarding 
this topic for 10/19.  Notes from that meeting will be presented 10/27.

Biaggio Mcphee created a Fact/Dimension table reflecting the data tables 
described as necessary for the project to proceed.  A copy of that Fact view 
will be delivered to all at the next meeting.  

The notes from last meeting were reviewed  in some detail.  Bjorn mentioned 
that for the Options in PR, Yolanda needed to provide Deltas, Gammas and Term 
Structures with the proper time bucket and expiration alerts.  No deliverable 
or time frame was established for this request.  Biaggio was asked to provide 
the Lease information flow in barrel volumes from the field to RA.  Next 
meeting he will discuss the timelines to achieve the database loads from the 
diagrams.
