Since the meeting begins at 8:00 AM on Wednesday, May 3 and since the agenda 
is so full, Dave Delainey would like to encourage you to stay over at 
Columbia Lakes on Tuesday evening if possible.  

If you wish to have a room for Tuesday evening, please notify me ASAP at 
3-6262 or via email.

Thanks!

Susan
