just thought I would pass this on.  The reporting team has been swamped the 
past few weeks with requests...

Sheri,

Just wanted to let you know how impressed I've been with the reporting team.  
Over the last few weeks they have helped Jennifer Mcquaid and myself out 
alot.  All requests have been done quickly and with good quality.  Kudos to 
your team.
