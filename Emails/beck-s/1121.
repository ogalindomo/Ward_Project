As a follow up from our discussions on global standards, I have made some 
minimal changes to the operating standards and have started putting together 
a contact list.  In the upcoming week, I will be finalizing the daily 
reporting formats and will send those out to you next week.

In the mean time, could you please review the contact listing attached below 
and give Pamela Sonnier any updates.  Also, please designate resources in 
your team who will be responsible for the reporting going forward.

If you have any questions or comments please call me at 713 853 9123. 

Looking forward to working with you.

Best regards

Shona
