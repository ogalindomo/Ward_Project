Sally, Bob

FYI - Nice note from the Chicago office regarding the roll-out and training 
in Unify. As you might know they are live on September 1 with Unify. 
Currently they are only pathing on NGPL but we expect them to expand to 
include both Trunkline and Northern Border. They have elected not to EDI 
until  they get more comfortable with the system (maybe for October 
business). 

We will continue to develop their staff on the use of Unify through 
additional training as noted below - Bob

Bob- 

Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that Richard Pinion's unify 
training secession was very sucessful.  The PGL employees that he trained 
were very complementary of Richard and they now feel confident that they will 
be able to use our system.   They are already looking forward to his return 
visit in September.  

Thankyou for your involvement with the Chicago office and our implementation 
of the Unify system.  


Richard
