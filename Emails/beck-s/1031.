I'll talk to Marcelo, but if they can't implement the appropriate control 
structure, then they have to be shut.

Good Morning

Should I call the locksmith or do I have any other volunteers?

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.
