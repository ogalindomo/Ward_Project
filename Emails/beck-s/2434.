I guess I heard some 'news' today. I spoke with Fernley and Cassandra.

We will no doubt speak next week when you're over.

I will tallk to Jo tonight.

My initial thoughts were 'wow'. I guess I need to digest the situation.

I must say a really big thank-you for the massive part you have obviously 
played in getting the opportunity this far. 

I think I'll need a beer tonight. My stomach has been knotted all afternoon.
