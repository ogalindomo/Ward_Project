We will look forward to seeing you on the 17th.  Glad we could work out a 
date.

HI, Sal.  You ARE correct:  we would be coming the weekend of the 17th/18th.
We'll leave Austin noonish on Saturday (I have a rowing lesson Saturday
morning!) and probably leave Houston mid-afternoon on Sunday.  Glad it still
works for you.   We'll look forward to seeing you guys and the new digs.
Love, C.
