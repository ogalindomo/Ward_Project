Attached is a file containing all cost centers that are allocating to Global 
Markets in the year 2001.  Could I please get from you a breakdown of every 
team affected by Global markets.  Please explain all percentages listed in 
column "A", by breaking apart into columns B - J.  Please feel free to call 
with any questions you may have.  Thanks so much for your help.

Please submit this explanation by tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks again for your help.
