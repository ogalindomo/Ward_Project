Greetings WellesleyTeam!!

I would like to first take the time to thank everyone for there dedication 
and support.  We extended 7 offers and we had 3 accepts, 1 decline, and 3 
outstanding.  

Now, it is time to prepare for the Spring recruiting season.  Below I have 
attached the team strategy for the Spring recruiting.  Please review the 
strategy and if you have a conflict with the event you are scheduled for  
please call or e-mail me immediately so that I can find a replacement.



Thanks, Geynille
