Hi, Sal.   Hope you are well.   I was out of town most of last week - and
again Sunday/Monday, so I feel a bit out of it!   How was Meagan's birthday?
Did she pass the driving test?   Did the earrings arrive in time?     Any
other news?   No big news here; just work.  Off to Arlington again on Friday
for a Special Olympics event, then on to a wedding Saturday.   Holiday
Monday.  Yippee!    How do you think the parental units are doing?   (I must
confess, I haven't talked to them too much lately . . . )    love, cara
