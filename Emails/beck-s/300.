The Final Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Curves should be available 
within the next 5 minutes.  

The Rate and Currency Group migrated to a new Curve Dump process today,  
which caused problems.  The curves issued at 4:45 pm were good, but then 
mistakenly overlayed at 5:00 pm.   If you retrieved the curves after 5:00 pm, 
you will need to recalc.  We apologize for any inconveniences this may have 
caused your group.

If you are still experiencing problems calculating, please call me at (713) 
853-9224 , Pager (713) 200-8343.

Thanks,
Clara
