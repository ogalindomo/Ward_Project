Subject: ENA/EOPS Recruiting Business Plan

Kathleen, attached is the Business Plan for ENA/EOPS.  I'm scheduled to 
attend several staff meetings next week.  Kim, Norma and I are still trying 
to schedule a meeting to discuss how we will address the overall HR needs of 
EOPS.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
