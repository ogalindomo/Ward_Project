I haven't heard from any of you as to whether you would be available.  I know 
it is short notice, but I really need someone who could spend 3 days in the 
"big apple."  Please let me know if you are available.

Thanks

Shona

Subject: help requested for doorstep to NY

We are trying to schedule a Doorstep to NY for the week of the 11th (11-13th) 
to review metals NY.  Are any of you available to attend?  Bjorn Hagelmann 
from RAC is already going and a deal test is planned to be completed.  In 
order to make this a true "Doorstep" we need a rep from Energy Ops.

Please let me know asap if you are available - remember, Xmas in NY is 
exciting! 

Thanks
