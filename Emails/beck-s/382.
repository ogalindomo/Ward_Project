Sally -

I seem to recall someone at ET&S sent you and I (among others) a draft policy 
for us to review back in December, and I never had time to address it. And 
now I can't remember who sent it or find it in my lotus mail in-box. Do you 
remember, and did you do anything on it?  I was going to discuss w/Rick Buy 
tomorrow his expectations re: involvement in affiliates' policies, and issue 
re: chinese wall, etc..  If you don't remember anything about this, no 
problem, just thought I'd ask.
