In approximately one month (9/9/2000), we are targeting that a new version of 
the Oracle NT client (8.1.6), Borland Database Engine (BDE) 5.1.1 and 
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5. to all Corp/ENA workstations. 
This software provides the connectivity from your workstation to Enron's 
Oracle databases and the applications supported by them.  We are currently in 
the process of testing all the applications managed by Corp/ENA Information 
Technology to ensure that they will be compliant with this new software.

This change may also effect your own developed MS-Access, MS-Excel 
spreadsheets, and/or MS-Query documents that retrieve data from Enron's 
Oracle databases via ODBC drivers. As part of the upgrade, all Oracle ODBC 
connections will be upgraded to compliant driver versions. 

If you would like to test your MS-Access databases and/or MS-Excel 
spreadsheets under the new software releases, please use one of the 
workstations at one of the following locations for your testing:
