I am planning to take a three week vacation in March of this year.  This is a 
special trip with my older sister who underwent treatment for breast cancer 
last year.  I have confirmed that all of my direct reports will be here 
during my absence.  Also, I will have my pager and a laptop with me during 
this time.  I am planning to book my trip in the next day or two.  Can you 
let me know if you have any problems or concerns with the length of my 
planned holiday?  I have already spoken to Jon McKay, and he has no problem 
with my plans.
Thanks
Peggy
