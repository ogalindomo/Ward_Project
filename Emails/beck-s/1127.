the Analyst and Associate Program - the Super Saturday process.  A major part 
of the process is the Saturday interview which has been changed this year.  
Interviewers now only review five candidates and the "offer " decision is now 
completed on the same day as the interview.  This decision process is 
facilitated by a member of Enron's executive committee and should be 
completed by 3:30 pm.  ENA is one of the major users of the Analyst and 
Associate pool and needs to be well represented at Super Saturday (which we 
are not at this time).  The Program still needs additional interviewers and 
the Office of the Chairman of ENA needs you to support the Program and the 
interview process.  Signing up is now easier than ever and all you need to do 
is access the following web site and fill in a few blanks.  The web site is 
as follows:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp.  The dates of Super 
Saturday's are listed below:  

     Associates:   Analysts:
     October 28   November 4
     November 11   November 18
     December 2   December 9
     December 15

The selection of qualified candidates is important to ENA  and Enron.  Your 
participation is needed, now especially for the October 28th and November 4th 
dates.  Please respond accordingly. 

Thanks,
Ted
