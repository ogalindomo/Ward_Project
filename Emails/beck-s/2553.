Michael, here is the claim memo to Vneshtopprom. I shall send this to the 
in-house translator in Moscow, but nothing will go to Vneshtopprom until 
everyone is happy with the draft. The Appendices are as per the third report 
save for the last 2 which I will circulate separately. The password is pink.
