In order to improve the timeliness of the DPR, a deadline of 12 noon 
following the trading day has been established for the receipt of all 
supporting files.  Please make every effort to meet this deadline or call 
Susan Scott or myself to let us know there will be a delay.  

Please call me if you have any questions about the deadline.  Your 
cooperation is greatly appreciated.
