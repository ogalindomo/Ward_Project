Dear Cultivators:

We are currently considering making some changes to the full-time offers this 
season.  Therefore, those candidates with the December 20 accept deadline 
will be given until January 2.  Please keep this in mind should your 
candidates have any questions.  I have sent each of them an e-mail informing 
them of the extension.  Those candidates which have already accepted will be 
sent a new offer letter, if necessary.

Thanks to those of you who are keeping me abreast of your cultivation 
efforts!  Please continue to let me know when you call/e-mail these 
candidates so that I can track our activity.

Thank you very much!
