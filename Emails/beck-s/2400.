Subject: Signing of Confirmations

Alan further to our discussion last Friday (your Thursday). The current 
practice remains whereby confirmations are sent Sue (to be replaced Scott) 
for signature. However, in recent times due to Sue's unavailability Heidi has 
been called upon to sign confirmations using her backup authority (on approx. 
3 occasions).

The report  arising from the recent "Project Doorstop" audit of the Sydney 
office included recommendations on development of a back office function in 
Sydney. This is under active discussion.
