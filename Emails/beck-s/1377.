The website containing all of the documentation created at the ASE is now 
available on our intranet.  Instructions for launching the site are below.  
This website contains the working documents created during the three day 
DesignShop.  It is organized chronolgically by the various activities we 
completed during the event.  Each section contains the assignment, team 
lists, the hypertiles used during the team report-outs and a transcript of 
the report outs.  The Executive Summary document you should have already 
received and a bibliography of the articles used during the External Scan are 
also included.  

As a participant, you may find these working documents to be helpful.  
However, those who were not participants in the session do not have the 
context within which the conversations and work were conducted.  Therefore, I 
encourage you to be prudent in the distribution of this information as it may 
be misinterpreted.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
