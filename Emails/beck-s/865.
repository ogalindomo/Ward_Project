Thanks for the heads up.  I get so many of these requests and never can tell 
what is being requested!  Your note made this one fast and easy to handle.  
Thanks.

Subject: fyi - eRequest for vpn

Hi there,
Just giving you a heads up that I have submitted an eRequest for vpn.  I have 
been instructed by the Resolutions Desk that I need vpn in order to use cable 
on my home computer.  The eRequest required 2 manager's and a vice president 
to be selected, (not sure if they need all of you to approve).

Thanks,
Avril
