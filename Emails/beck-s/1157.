Hiring Managers, 

Here are a few tips that will immediately improve the time it takes to make a 
offer to your candidates.   

All applicants must fill out and sign an Application and a Fair Credit 
Reporting Act form (included with the application) prior to being 
interviewed.   You may either have the applicant fill out a form before you 
interview them or you can send the applicant to the 36th floor to fill out 
the forms before you interview them.     
Notify Hector McLoughlin or Frank deJesus if you are interviewing an external 
candidate that is a former Enron employee.    All previous Enron employees 
will be reviewed by HR and Sally Beck prior to being invited to interview.   
We hope that this process will eliminate re-hiring poor performers. 
If you want to make an offer of employment to a candidate for a Management 
Position, please include Sally Beck in the process for input.    As a final 
step of the selection process, Sally would like to meet with the candidate if 
time allows or to phone interview the candidate as an alternative.    Sally's 
involvement should occur after you have identified the candidate as a 
potential Management new hire. 

Thanks for your help with this process.
