Dear Kate,

We are now ranking the findings - red or yellow.  Since these need to be done 
immediately, I suggest that they are red findings.

Regards

Subject: Mariner Doorstep Report

Attached is the Mariner Doorstep Report.  Jim Brown indicated that the action 
dates for the three findings should be immediately, we decided that October 1 
was a realistic deadline for implementation.  Please let us know any comments 
or questions.  

Thank You
Kate
