Dear UT Team, 

Good news and bad....

I just received notice that Melanie Sandoval will be declining our offer.  
Although we offered more money, he has chosen to accept with Neiman Marcus in 
Dallas.
However, Ali Ahmed will be accepting our offer!  He is expected to start once 
his practical training authorization becomes effective in February.  Please 
call and congratulate him (512/469-9105 or aliahmed@mail.utexas.edu).  He 
will be out of the country tomorrow through January 7.

Happy Holidays!
