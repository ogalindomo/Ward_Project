Sally, just wanted to let you know that I will be talking to Hector, Frank 
and Janet tomorrow afternoon, Wednesday, about the transition.  Ryan is great 
to work with and I think you will really like her.  

I'm glad that I had you in my client group long enough to see you make MD 
(which was long overdue).  Congratulations again and let me know if there is 
anything I can do to help you in the future.   Good Luck.

Sheila Walton
