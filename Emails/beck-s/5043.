I don't know who AnneMarie is, but we just went ahead and did our 
Satisfactory evals.  It is ridiculous to wait so long to communicate 
performance feedback.

Subject: Mid-Year PRC

I would like to update you on the progress we have made on Energy Ops 
mid-year review process.  All of the "Needs Improvement" evaluations have 
been executed except for two which will be executed before the 9/1 deadline.  
We still need to review 51 "Satisfactory" evaluations.  Our target date for 
this process is September 1st.   Please forward your "Satisfactory" 
evaluations  to myself or Hector McLoughlin by September 1st so we can review 
them and move forward in the process.  Thank you for your help.

Anne Marie Allex
