Your HR Generalist will be contacting you in the next few days to strategize 
with you regarding the status of contractors in your group that have worked 
nine or more months at Enron.     Our goal is to limit possible liability 
that may exist within your group.   Please let us know what times would be 
best for you to meet with us and we will schedule accordingly.
