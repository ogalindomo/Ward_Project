Subject: Re: Dinner Invitation


Dear Mrs. Beck,

Thank you very much for the invitation.
I'm excited to tour Enron field because even though I am from Houston, I have
yet to attend an Astro's game.  I look forward to attending, and I thank you
for supporting our Energy Management program at OU.

Sincerly,
Heather Pinkerton
