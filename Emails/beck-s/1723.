Greetings, UT Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at the University of Texas.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from UT to join our Analyst 
Program.

Our first campus event will be on Monday, August 21 and interviews will be 
held on campus October 4 and 5.  I have a variety of campus events planned, 
so I hope you are all able to participate.

We will be more formally organizing ourselves in the next couple of weeks.  
Currently, we are planning to have a brief team meeting during the week of 
August 14th in order to make introductions, inform you about the Analyst 
Program, and discuss the fall recruiting calendar.  To that end, please 
contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

I will notify you once the team meeting date is set.  

I look forward to meeting you all soon.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott
Analyst Recruiter
