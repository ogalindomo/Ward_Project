Update - Current status (all times are London times)

Officialisation for the 31st of May DPR was made around 3pm for both the 
Bilateral and the Pool books.

Officialisation for the 30th was not done due to book running problems which 
resulted in the DPR only being completed at 11pm.

The last V@R calculation was made on the 26th due to book split problems. The 
V@R for the 31st will be run today.
