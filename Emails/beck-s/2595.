My name is Alexus Rhone, and I'm your new staffing/recruiting contact.  I'm 
looking forward to working with each of you to assist in identifying, hiring 
and retaining a strong workforce for Energy Operations.  As most of you may 
know, Samantha Ray is now recruiting for EES.  And I'm sad to report Gail 
Francis will be joining her effective this week.

Linda Vargo will replace Gail as my assistant.  Together she and I will work 
diligently to handle your recruiting needs.  Please be sure to carbon Linda 
on any written correspondence with me concerning opening requisitions or 
requesting interview schedules. 

I've already met most of you.  And I look forward to meeting the rest of you 
before too long.  If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call me at 
ext. 3-3202 or Linda Vargo at ext. 3-0637.
