Thanks for the update with respect to the PRC.  I will be in Houston for VAR 
training on September 21 & 22.  I will probably come down 1 or 2 days before 
if you want to schedule my review during that time.

The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your 
calendars:  November 15-17.  

Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these.
