Just to clarify - Scheduled volumes can show a volume twice - for example -
a buy and a sell are shown separately, whereas throughput would only count
the volume one time.

Subject: Weekly Report Volume Data

Attached is a spreadsheet detailing volumes for the Weekly Report requested by
Louise Kitchen.

I have included for your review, two volumes to consider.  I recommend we use 
the first
volume, or Throughput Volume.  This volume represents all gas that is 
delivered by
Enron North America.

Once you have approved the numbers you would like to use, Brian and Shari can 
include it
in their weekly report.

If you have any questions, changes, or suggestions, please feel free to page 
me at
713-762-3325 or call me at x-37059.



Thank you.

Diane
