Dear EnTelligence user,
 
Effective April 30th, 2001 the EnTelligence system will be taken permanently 
offline.  Current usage of the system is not high enough to justify ongoing 
data maintenance and development costs. We recognize that you were a user of 
the system, but trust that you understand the economic motivation behind this 
decision. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any 
concerns or wish to comment on this action, please contact myself on 
extension 5-8768.

If you have any requirements for adhoc reporting, please contact our Helpline 
at extension 3-3147 or email your request to: entelligence@enron.com. 
Requests must be received prior to April 28th, in order to be processed prior 
to closure of the system.

The Global Data Management group (James Scribner, extension 3-9641) will be 
maintaining a reduced relationship with Dun & Bradstreet.  If you need 
assistance in requesting data from D&B similar to which was maintained by 
EnTelligence, James will be available to assist you in your discussions with 
D&B.
 
 
Thank you
 
Avril Forster
