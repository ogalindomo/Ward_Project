Dear OU Team:

I have begun scheduling events for next fall's recruiting effort.  Please 
mark your calendars for the following:

September 26 - Career Fair
October 22 and 23 - Interviews

I am currently working with Tim Rasnic and Ted Jacobs to set the date for our 
information session.  I will send the date to you as soon as possible.

If you are interested in volunteering for any of these events, please drop me 
a note.



Thanks!
