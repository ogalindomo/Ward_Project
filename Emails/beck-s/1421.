Debbie,

FYI, Sally Beck will be flying up afternoon of Sept. 28.  Please make her 
reservation for 28th only.  Also, do you have the address of Stone Davis Hall 
where dinner & presentation will be held?  I need that for her itinerary.  
And lastly, can you put me on cc: list for Wellesley info.  It's just makes 
it easier for me.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
(Sally Beck's Assistant)
