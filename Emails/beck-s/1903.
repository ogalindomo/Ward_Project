Hello Everyone,

There is a new version of the database.  Please install by Hitting your Start 
Button, Run, Type O:\EOL\EOL REPORTING DATABASE\VIEW DATA\EOL VIEW DATABASE 
INSTALLER.BAT.  The new version of the database will automatically shut you 
out for 15 minutes everyday when it is necessary to update with the current 
trading data.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

The old version of the database no longer contains any data.   Please be sure 
to update.

Thanks,

Carrie and Eugenio
