Ted informed me that Jeff Skilling and Rick Buy have agreed to a 
discretionary VaR allocation of $15MM effective today through December 15th 
(next Friday) for a total North American Natural Gas VaR of $75MM.

That increases our Aggregate VaR Limit for Enron to $100MM for that same 
period.

Please modify notification and DPR reporting accordingly.

Cassandra Schultz.
