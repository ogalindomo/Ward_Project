Sally,

Shari and I would like to schedule an hour of your time from 3:00 pm to 4:00 
pm on Wednesday, October 25, 2000.  During this time Shari will present to 
you the September results for the Operations Pricing Model.  We would also 
like to give you a briefing of the overall status of the project.

Let me know if this is a good time.

Thanks.
