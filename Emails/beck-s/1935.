Attached is a file summarizing the action plan for completing Energy OP's 
showstopper reports.  I have made a stab at initial assignments of 
responsibilities and due dates.  Please review and let me know if I have 
missed anything.  Thanks in advance for your help.  

In addition to the action items listed for each report, we will be soliciting 
London's input/comments via conference call tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.
