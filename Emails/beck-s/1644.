As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Shona
