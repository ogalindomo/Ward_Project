Dear Sally,
It was a pleasure to meet with you on Tuesday, April 4 at UT to discuss my
qualifications for the Enron Scholarship.  It is a great honor to be
nominated for an award that is regarded so highly here in the business
school.  I believe as a nominee, and hopefully as a recipient, that I can
uphold the values that are at the core of Enron's business.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my ideas with you.  I look
forward to hearing the outcome.
Also, could you please pass along Gene's email address as well.  I am
assuming it is similar to yours, but I just wanted to make sure.
Sincerely,

Jason Ware
