Wanda and Sally,
Merchant Assets and ECT Investments Inc. are both making a $6.9 million entry 
which will reduce the MTM Asset on Merchant Assets.  We will book a payable 
to MA and they will book a inter company receivable from ECTI.
We will continue with the reconciliation and keep you apprised of our 
progress.
Hope and Sheila
