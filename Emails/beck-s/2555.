FYI, Joe Hirl, the trader in charge of setting up the Tokyo trading office, 
will be in Houston next week, and it would probably be a good idea if he 
could interview Mark Frank, or whatever candidate we recommend for the 
Controller position.   Our Controller for the Sydney office will be up the 
following week and he should meet with her as well, as that will enable him 
to get first hand knowledge of the remote trading office establishment issues 
we've addressed in Australia.

Sally - did you decide on the one candidate you thought of when we met last?  
We might want to arrange a meeting with him and Joe also.

Thanks,

Cassandra.
