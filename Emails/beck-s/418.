Attached are the hypertiles from the final report out at yesterday's ASE 
Studio Workshop.  The CD is finished and on its way to Houston.  The files 
are organized by team:

to Approach, Pricing, SLA
Pliers - Producst and Services - Consulting Based
Saw - Infrastructure Transition Plan
Wrench - Producst and Services - Basic Outsourcing

I hope these help with your meeting tomorrow.  Let me know if there is 
anything else I can do to help.
