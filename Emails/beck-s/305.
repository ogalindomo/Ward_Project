As many of you know, The University of Texas has its most significant 
fundraising effort underway.  As a part of that effort, the Red McCombs 
School of Business is trying to raise $130 million which will help it to 
achieve its goal to become the next great business school in the world.  
Obviously, the Red McCombs gift of $50 million (the largest ever contributed 
to the University) is a big part of that effort.  However, much more is 
needed and will only be achieved through participation by a significant 
number of alumni and friends of the University.

On Tuesday, February 6th at 2 pm, Dean Bob May of the McCombs School will be 
at the Enron Building to meet with us about the School's plans and how we can 
participate.  I am organizing this meeting for Bob and inviting all Enron 
officers that are UT alumni.  This should be a very informal meeting with 
relatively few attendees (hopefully around 25 people).  It will give you a 
chance to get to know Bob, what is going on at the Business School and how 
you can participate. Make no mistake.  We hope the result is that you decide 
to support the effort.  There is a unique opportunity to participate at this 
time because, in addition to matching funds from Enron, the McCombs gift 
provides for additional matching funds for contributions of a certain level.  
I have found that this matching provides a real opportunity to make endowment 
level gifts.

Enron and the McCombs School have a great partnership.  The company has made 
a significant commitment to the school's programs, we have a very significant 
presence on campus through our activities and support from administration and 
faculty, and we have enjoyed great success recruiting for a number of years.  
However, Enron has never successfully organized its alumni giving in a way 
which would allow for even greater Enron support and presence while 
optimizing each individual's contribution.  I am hopeful that as a group of 
Enron officers, we can set the example of coordinated giving.

Please plan to attend the meeting.  It will be held in the Board Room on 50, 
last about an hour and refreshments will be served.  Please let me or Sharron 
Westbrook (extension 37094)  know if you can attend.  Thanks.
