Sally:

I'm pleased to note that you will once again be my PRC Rep.  Since the time 
we talked a couple of weeks earlier in your office, I have rotated out of the 
Middle East Development Group as of 10/31/00 and joined Larry Lawyer's 
Finance Group in EGM.  I'm really excited about my new rotation.  With 
regards to my work over the last 6 months, I'd be happy to give you a 
personal account of my achievements at a time convenient to you.  Meanwhile, 
should you need any information from my end, pls call me at x-54326.

Regards,

Inderpal
