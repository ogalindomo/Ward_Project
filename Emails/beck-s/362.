Attached is a memo summarizing policy changes and revised trading limits that 
will be recommended to the BOD for approval on the 13th, next week.  We can 
discuss at the Risk Forum Luncheon tomorrow (Chris, you're invited also) - 
some DPR reporting practices may need modification to aggregate commodity 
risk across the company.

Regards,
Cassandra.
