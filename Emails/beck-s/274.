Sally,
I am writing this article for the March issue of Shared Services Newsletter,
but I thought you might be interested in it. While you are not technically a
shared service, your group has many of the same attributes. The idea of
selling your services outside Enron may have crossed your mind as you look
at certain opportunities. Let me know what you think!
Thanks,
