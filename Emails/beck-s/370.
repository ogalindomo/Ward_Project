 Sally, 

 Bob Hall came by and asked me to forward a list of guest to you for the 
Offsite Proposal to Park City, Utah.
 
 It is as follows: 
 
 Sally Beck
 Jeff Gossett
 Bob Hall
 Peggy Hedstrom
 Brenda Herod
 Leslie Reeves
 Stacey White
 Beth Apollo
 James Scribner
 Mary Solmonson
 Sheri Thomas
 Shona Wilson
 Brent Price
 Scott Earnest
 Sheila Glover
 Todd Hall
 Tom Myers
 Kevin Sweeney

 I took the Home Phone List of your direct reports and added (7) in case you 
wanted to invite guests (i.e., addt'l staff, HR, Tom Hopwood). 
 If you would like me to go back and give you a revised estimate with a 
smaller headcount, I would be happy to.
