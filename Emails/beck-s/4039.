Dear Eugenio,

I did not want to say this when everyone else was around, but I am concerned 
that no attempt was made to meet the deadline of this morning that we 
discussed last Friday. (to decide on a name for the database).  Only Maria 
Teresa had her information to me this am as requested. The deadline could 
have been easily met by working diligently this morning, but Jennifer did not 
come in until 8:30 and MT until 8:15.

I thought we had discussed the urgency of this - to have something to present 
at the 10am meeting.  We need to discuss this to ensure it does not happen 
again.

Best regards

Shona
