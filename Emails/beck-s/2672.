Hi Amita and Angela,

Today went very smoothly. We had one glitch in that UK Power jumped the gun 
and changed their columns in today's report.  We were able to spot it and fix 
it.  Getting the heads up from Lara was greatly appreciated!  Please continue 
to communicate changes you know about to us because it is a tremendous help!

Thank you for your help.  Hope you have a great afternoon!



Carrie
