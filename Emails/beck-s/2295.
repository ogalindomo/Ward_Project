Sally - here's the answer I got on office space in the new building.  It 
sounds like we will have a say in the matter.  I would hope that you would 
want and would get a representative on whatever committee is established.  
Please let me know if you need anything else related to this matter.

Lisa, I am forwarding Bill Donovan's answer to your question about who gets 
private offices in the new building.

Thanks.

Dorothy - 

Please advise Lisa that our expectation is that each Business Unit will 
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their 
workforce (as is the case today) .

Corporate may intercede only to the point that a Business Unit fails to 
design to a sufficient density (average sq. ft. per workplace) and does not 
meet minimum.  Hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus 
from Enron's Executive Committee before detailed space planning begins.  

- Bill
