I just wanted to say CONGRATULATIONS on your recent promotion.  In case you 
are wondering who I am, I work in the Global Contracts groups under Linda 
Bryan as Staff- Deal Compliance.  

Its always good to see someone who is on your same team succeeding.

Much success in your future at Enron.

Best Regards,
Bridgette Anderson
