I will be in Calgary Wednesday and Thursday this week.  Tuesday is tough, 
because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.  I can make time on 
Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.  --Sally

Subject: ASE Draft Agenda Walkthrough

Hello folks -

As we discussed in the initial sponsor meeting, we would like to have a 
preliminary walkthrough of the ASE Studio Workshop draft agenda.  We are 
targeting this discussion for either Tuesday or Wednesday morning and will 
need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a thorough review.  Please let me know when 
you can meet and I will arrange the logistics.

Thanks
Lisa P
