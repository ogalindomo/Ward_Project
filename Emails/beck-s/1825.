As a follow up to my message yesterday, I have talked to George McClellan who 
assured me that he is taking things in India slowly and that no coal 
transactions will be taking place in the near term.

I also talked to Bill Bradford who has been in discussions with the office 
regarding counterparty credit.  However, nothing has been formalized.
