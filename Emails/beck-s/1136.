You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that 
without your having to tell me.  I cherish having sisters and love you very 
much too.  (Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but 
don't tell Cara I said that!)

If I haven't told you recently I am very glad you are my sister.  I love
you.

 Cindy (hoping this one goes to the right Sally!)
