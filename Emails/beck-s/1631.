I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and 
is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the 
invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger 
Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last 
year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this 
summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on 
appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know 
people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally
