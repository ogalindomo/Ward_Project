Due to the President's Day holiday in the U.S. on Monday, 2/21/2000, the 
Nymex and equity markets will be closed.  As a result, there will not be a 
DPR published for this day.   The DPR for Friday, 2/18/2000 will be published 
on Tuesday, 2/22/2000.  Any P&L calculated for Monday, 2/21/2000 (i.e. 
Europe) should be combined with activity for Tuesday 2/22/2000.  Activity for 
these 2 days will be combined and reported in the DPR for 2/22/2000.  

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
