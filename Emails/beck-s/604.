Please note that I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday (December 14 
& 15).  Camalla (pronounced like Pamela but with a "C") Washington will be 
sitting in for me both days.  Please call her if you need assistance.  As a 
back-up, please call Chantelle Villanueva (x36279).

Thanks,
Patti x39106
