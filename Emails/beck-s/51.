Dear OU Team:

We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned each of 
you to one or more candidates to contact weekly, beginning this week.  

By taking "ownership" you will create a more personal relationship with your 
candidate(s) and help us to stay abreast of any questions or concerns they 
may have.

Please keep me posted regarding these cultivation efforts so that no one is 
left out.

Thanks again for all your work and participation!  

Please let me know if you have any questions.
