I have reviewed the memo distributed in yesterday's staff meeting and offer 
the following changes in red:

Brenda Herod serves as Business Controller for ENA's assets business, working 
with the Gas Assets group and the Texas trading desk.  Her responsibilities 
include global contracts and facilities, risk management, confirmations, gas 
scheduling, volume management, settlements and regulatory compliance for 
Houston Pipeline, LRC and Enron Midstream Services.


Thanks.
