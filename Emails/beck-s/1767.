FYI, Sally has changed her plans slightly - She will now be back in the 
office Monday morning (7/31).

Thanks for the info.  If you'd like to see the logo the team selected, you 
can go to luminant.com.  Hit login (upper right corner) and go to userid 
(tgros) and password (commoditylogic). Touch the "look and feel" icon and see 
the logos.  We selected the first one  in row A.
Enjoy the college hunting!
