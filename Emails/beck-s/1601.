The DPR for today is final and posted to the Executive Reports Viewer.

Please note a minor change in the DPR format today.  The "Merchant Portfolio" 
section of the DPR now displays only the totals for this portfolio.  The 
details have been hidden.  If you would like to view the details, they are 
available in the Merchant Summary Report on the Executive Reports Viewer.  

Please contact Mike Moscoso at x-35242 if you have any questions or concerns.
