Hello Team!!!

Due to scheduling conflicts the strategy has been adjusted.  Please review 
the strategy for the changes and adjust your schedules accordingly.  If you 
have problems or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

I will be out of the office until the 16th but will be checking e-mail and 
voice mail.



Thanks,
