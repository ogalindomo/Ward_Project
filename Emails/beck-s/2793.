I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I 
don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to 
attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their 
schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the 
office that day.  --sally
