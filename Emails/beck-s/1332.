The presentations from the San Antonio Leadership Conference are now 
accessible from the Business Risk Management intranet page.  Just click on 
"Conference San Antonio."   Please pass this information on to accounting 
personnel who were not at the conference as well.

Attached is the mentoring questionnaire for you to volunteer to be a mentor 
in our new mentoring program.  You can complete it electronically and email 
it to me or you can print it and send it to EB 1923.  Thanks for being a part 
of this new program.
