Sally:? Here are the plans for the meeting on  Sunday...Bill Lindsay, HPD, 
will be at your house @2:15 to do a talk on Safety  in the car? I told him 
very informal, want the girls to ask  questions.? Sarah is going to do basics 
of car care from a women's point of  view...simple.? We know these girls are 
not going to change oil...but they  need to know that it needs to be 
changed...and so on.? I was afraid to have  more than two guest speakekrs, as 
one never knows how long they will end up  taking.? I have tried and tried to 
reach Megan S. who is own nominating  committee.? Lori Van Dike can only meet 
on Sunday, Abi said Sunday is okay  with her...I told Lori plan on meeting 
here (we can change that)at 12:30..If you  want to be involved, we could do 
it at your house if easier, know that sometimes  your church runs over.? 
Sarah is going to check and let me know if anyone  is not? "in good standing" 
and can not hold office.? Snacks, paper  goods are handled for your meeting.? 
Have a safe trip.? I will be  around on Sat., if you have questions, cell is 
713 818 8587.?  Linda
