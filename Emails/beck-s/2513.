The attached document is draft 4 of the Interim services ENA will provide to 
Bridgeline.  Please review and provide any comments ASAP as we are working 
towards a FINAL version.

I will be coordinating a meeting for next week to review these services and 
provide a status.  If you are interested in attending, please let me know.  

Thanks,
