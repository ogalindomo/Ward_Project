Sally,

I wanted to send you a short note to tell you about the success of last 
nights Office of the Chairman Holiday Assistant's Party.

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was 
because of Heather Choate.  I sent out ONE email to Patti and she recruited 
Heather who made huge efforts to get some wonderful gifts to be given out. 

It is nice to see people truly going above and beyond!  She was a superstar!
