Attached please find a summary of the Clearing User meetings held on November 
16-17.  The next step in the process
is to convene the Legal Task Force to address the legal issues raised in the 
meetings.

Following the outcome of the Task Force, analysis will be done to determine 
where to go from where we are at.

If you have any questions, please contact Sarita at 5-8232 or myself at 
3-7569.
