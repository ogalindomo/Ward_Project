If you would like, the team will be prepared to show live demonstrations of 
the latest versions of all four CommodityLogic modules next Thursday, 
December 21st.  This would probably require about 2 hours.  The versions 
displayed will be:

Financial Management Module 2.0
Financial Invoice Exchange 1.1
Confirm Central 1.0
Contract Exchange 1.0

Please let us know if you are interested in attending.

All the best,

Tom
