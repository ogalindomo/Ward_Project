There is a disagreement over where US Drift should be shown on the DPR.  
After discussions with all of you, it is apparent that Mark Frevert must make 
the decision about whether to move US Drift from the Enron Global Markets 
section where it currently resides to the Enron Americas section.

As I understand it Mark is currently traveling and out of reach.  Once I know 
his decision, any necessary changes will be made.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best regards
