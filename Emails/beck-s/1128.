Subject: MID YEAR 2000 Feedback will be deleted on 17 November

All;

As I mentioned this morning at Cindy's HR Leadership meeting, we plan to 
delete the mid-year 2000 feedback from our system on 17 November 2000.  Would 
you kindly communicate this to your clients, to ensure that any outstanding 
final evaluations for mid-year 2000 are completed before that date.  

Supervisors who may need to obtain consolidated feedback on their employees 
or  to obtain final evaluation forms may call the Houston PEP Help Desk on  
(713) 853-4777 (option 4) or via e-mail to PEP Help Desk employee Vincent 
Cassata  (vincent.cassata@enron.com).  

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me on 
x53377.  Thanks,

Gina
