James New will be visiting Houston from Tuesday 9 until Thursday 11 May and 
would like to meet up with you for an hour during his visit. Please could you 
let me know your availability or get your assistants to get in touch with 
either myself or Fiona McNaught to arrange a meeting.

Monday 1 May is a bank holiday in the UK, but we will respond to your 
messages on Tuesday.

Many thanks for your assistance.
