As scheduled, we are planning a quick status check meeting on the SAP / Unify 
/ Financials project  at 4:00 today. 

Key points that will be discussed include: 
Current status of any open requirement points (and resolutions to close them)
Current status of Financials development and testing (hopefully some good 
news here)
Current status of SAP interface test (and we believe some good news here as 
well)
Current status of contingency automated interface to Sift (Net-net: It's too 
difficult to develop this in the required time but with the good news above  
we may not need it)
Status and action items for FIT4 test planning in June. 


Thanks.
