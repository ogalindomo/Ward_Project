See revised.  I made a few changes pursuant to a conversation with Debbie.



I have requested that a folder be created on the O: common drive under 
O:/Corporate/CPTY_Cash_Schedules.  Selected individuals from each company and 
Credit will be given access to update the schedule.  It will probably be 
Monday before that is ready.
