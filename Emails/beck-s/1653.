Rick has asked that I schedule a Business Review session with Jeff Skilling 
early in September.  Jeff is available on September 7 from 10:00 - 11:00.
The meeting is scheduled for Jeff's office.  If you plan to bring anyone with 
you to the meeting please let me know and we will need to move to a larger 
room.



The meeting will be divided into 3  20 minute sessions:


SAP Update   Melissa Becker
Strategic Sourcing  George Wasaff
Global Risk Mgmt/Doorstep Sally Beck
