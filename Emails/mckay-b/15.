Greetings and Happy Holidays to all of my Big Braves and Little Guides and
Princesses,

This is just a reminder on the Children's Museum activity planned for
Saturday, 12/2/00.  This activity will be from Noon until 5:00pm.   The
admission is $10.00 for the Parent and the Child.  Please keep in mind that
the trip does not necessarily have to begin at Noon.  This is an activity
where you can set an arrival time that is convenient for yourself or your
tribe.   Just remember that the Museum closes at 5:00pm.  Unfortunately, I
have an emergency that can not be avoided so I will be arriving probably
later in the day if at all.  Please contact anyone who you feel may benefit
from this outing whether it be tribal members or family and friends.   I
will be in touch again soon to give details on the Holiday Skating Party at
the Sharpstown skating center.  I hear that Santa is going to be there so
I'm sure that it's going to be a blast.
