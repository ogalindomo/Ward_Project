Subject:  The last statistic is the good one



Important statistics:

Counties won by Gore: 677
Counties won by Bush: 2,434

Population of counties won by Gore: 127 million
Population of counties won by Bush: 143 million

Square miles of country won by Gore: 580,000
Square miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000

States won by Gore: 19
States won by Bush: 29

Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2
Average Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1

Ah ? those Gore voters.

And may I add that the map of the territory Bush won was the land owned
by the people of this great Country. Not the citizens living in cities
in housing owned by the government.and living off the government.
