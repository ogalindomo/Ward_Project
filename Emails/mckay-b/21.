Hi Guys,
?
Good news, the campout for this weekend will take place at  Camp Pine Tree 
rather than Camp Cullen.? Camp Pine Tree is just north of  Houston off I-45 
near Old Town Spring.? The Dads and boys are planning to  meet for dinner 
Friday at 6 pm at Fuddruckers on I-10 (behind Pappasitos) and  then drive up 
to the camp and check in.? Rick is working with LeRoy at the  YMCA to have 
everyone in the cabin.? For more information about the Camp  you can log onto 
www.campymca.org
?
?
?On December 9th the Indian Guides will meet with the  YMCA KODA nation at 
Sharpstown Ice Center , 7300 Bellerive, at Noon and will  skate until 1:30.? 
Admission is $5.64 per person which includes skate  rental.? ( Santa is going 
to stop by too!!!)? Please let Rick Matthews  or myself know if you plan to 
attend so we can pass the information along to the  YMCA for planning 
purposes.
?
Call if you have any questions and I will try to answer them  or get answers 
for you.
