Enron's 2000 United Way campaign is fast approaching.  To facilitate 
questions you may have about United Way and your involvement, we have added a 
"United Way" category to eMeet.  Please visit eMeet and post your questions 
or comments.  This category will be checked periodically by a member of 
Enron's United Way team, so your questions will be answered.
