Thanks for the update.  

I agree we should go ahead and prepare for the inevitable "I want to flow 
tomorrow" scenario.  Let's use the $35,000 to proceed with our internal 
administrative needs, including "land owner notification" and then we will be 
ready for them when they begin construction.

Let me know if there is anything I can do.
