Michelle Lokay,

If you haven't signed up for this year's tournament on October 16th at the 
Woodlands, you still have time and space is still available in each event.  
If you register and pay by Monday, October 2, you'll be automatically entered 
into a private drawing for a door prize worth approximately $500!

Don't miss out!  Make your plans now, and register today by clicking on

See you in a few weeks!
