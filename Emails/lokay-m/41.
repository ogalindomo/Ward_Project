Please read note below from our SAP Timekeeping Team:


By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period.
