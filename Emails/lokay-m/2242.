Some of you are storing and accessing files in locations that the migration 
team may not aware of.  To make sure that all the files you access get 
migrated over, please reply and identify all the drives, servers, and folders 
where you routinely save your information.  Also, remember that no data files 
should be stored on your local PC (c: or d: drive).  If you have been keeping 
files there, you must copy them up to your H: drive before the migration!

Please click "reply with history", then list all your file locations under 
here (you can delete the examples) and then send it.  Thanks!
