Here is the status of all outstanding long term contracts:

Duke - 5 year, 20 MMcf/d EOT contract.   Currently routing.  Will probably 
receive Presidential approval either Friday or Monday.

Red Cedar - Contract has been with Red Cedar since September 7th.

Sempra - Option to call upon 21,500 Dth/d of EOT to Needles capacity was 
elected August 24th.  I am tired of nagging.  We need the request form to 
begin the deal process.
