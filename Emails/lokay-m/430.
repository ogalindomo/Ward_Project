Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 
20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. 
Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was 
expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, 
Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. 

El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the 
site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective 
on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available 
throughput level while operating under the federal Department of 
Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos 
River area.
