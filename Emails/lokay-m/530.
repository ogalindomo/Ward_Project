I will need to hear from you today on your choice of activities scheduled for 
the outing in October.  The following is a list of activities and 
corresponding names of customers planning to participate.  Please let me know 
which you would like to participate in.  You may all discuss if you would 
like to, but make sure I hear from you today, not tomorrow, today (smile).
