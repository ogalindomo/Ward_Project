Kim,

Here's the November Park and Ride activity with it's associated rates and 
revenues.  You might find some opportunities here to use the TW Deal Analysis 
tool.  Maybe its Morgan or TK Lohmann who could use this tool to set P&R 
rates to ensure we cover the varialble O&M costs.  As you can see there's not 
much revenue associated with P&R during the course of the month so the impact 
on linepack and fuel use has the potential to exceed the benefits.

Thanks........Terry
