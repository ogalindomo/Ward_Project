+OGE Energy Corp.'s Enogex Subsidiary Sells Non-Core Assets

OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of
several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets
include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three
natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the
transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling
about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with
Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC.

In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties,
along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and
agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in
Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County,
including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related
contracts and rights of way.

The Oklahoma sale was to Seminole Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Seminole Energy Services LLC of Tulsa.
