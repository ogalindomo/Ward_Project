Coastal Corp. announced that Engage Energy U.S., L.P. has changed its name to 
Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which coincides with the split of the Engage 
Energy joint venture by participants Coastal and Westcoast Energy. Effective 
on Oct. 3, the operations were divided into separate entities which are owned 
and operated solely by each company. Coastal Merchant Energy, which handles 
up to 3.5 Bcf/d, appointed James C. Dyer IV as president and CEO. "Coastal 
Merchant Energy, L.P. will continue to provide a full spectrum of energy 
services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading 
and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services, 
and energy risk management services," said David A. Arledge, CEO of The 
Coastal Corp. "We will undoubtedly benefit from the further integration of 
our merchant activities with Coastal's asset-based businesses."
