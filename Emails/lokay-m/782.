El Paso extended an unauthorized overpull penalty situation yesterday for all 
customers. "You are urged to immediately review your supply/demand balance, 
and the performance of your suppliers, to insure sufficient gas is being 
delivered to El Paso to cover the gas being taken off the system," the 
pipeline said. To ensure system integrity, El Paso is placing limits on 
scheduled volumes at interconnects that are underperforming. For details, 
contact Gary Williams at (915) 496-2051, Mario Montes at (915) 496-2617, Bud 
Wilcox at (915) 496-2934 or the Customer Assistance Hotline, (800) 441-3764.
