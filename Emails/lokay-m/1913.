High demand, perilously low storage inventories, and a supply response that 
is only beginning have driven gas prices in North America to stratospheric 
levels. The physical shortfall is now real enough, and prices have risen well 
above previous record highs to levels that should drive any demand that can 
realistically do so to leave the market. Gas is now pricing near the level of 
distillate for the first time ever, providing strong economic incentives to 
push to maximum levels of fuel switching.
