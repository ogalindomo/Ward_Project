Everyone is invited to attend this conference call on Current Conditions in 
the Gas Market.  Feel free to conference in from wherever you are.  This one 
we do NOT have to register for.  Just follow the instructions below.  We will 
meet in Conference Room 697 in Omaha.  The Houston folks may want to get a 
conference room as well.

This call is different than the one on Monday, September 11, dealing with the 
Power Market.  That one we do have to register for, so if you want to attend 
that one, let me know.
