We have moved another change into production where any bid equal to over the 
max rate will be valued using a 0% throughput commitment.  This way, any one 
part and two part bid over max rate will be evaluated in the same manner.  
This also means that when a user checks the max rate button, a 0% throughput 
commitment will be assumed.
