Not too bad so far - of course, first day is kind of boring, and not a lot of 
people in the office.? We get out at noon tomorrow and are off Monday and 
Tuesday.

I am not sure when we will be back - you can mail the pics if you want to, or 
wait.? I have some also, but the Christmas ones are on a new roll that is not 
finished yet.? I am guessing we will either be in Houston or Dallas at New 
Year's.? 

Should I use Michelle.Lokay@enron.com for your address, or is mlokay okay? 
(it rhymes!)? Also, what is Scott Goodell's e-mail - it came back to me?

Hope to see you soon, and have a great Christmas.? Oh yeah, would you be 
interested in the pedicure I have left on my Urban Retreat gift certificate?? 
I never got around to using it.

Subject: Hi!


How are you?? Was it hard going in for a full day today? 

I was hoping you were going to call us before you left town...got all the
pictures developed from the weekend.? Made copies for you and there were 
very cute ones of Meghan and Caroline!? Do you want me to mail them to you 
or will you guys be back soon?!?!
