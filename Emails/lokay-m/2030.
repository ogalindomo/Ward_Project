All the mail boxes were re-done over the weekend.  Each has a label holder 
that will make it easier to move if someone leaves or someone new comes on 
board.  Management asks that you not put any stickers, emblems, colored dots 
or anything else to recognize your mail box.  If any box has to be changed 
next week, then they have to be scraped off.
From the front, outside Fax Center,  Market Services starts alphabetically 
from the left to right on top row of the curve.
The alphabet continues to bottom row of curve from right to left.  HOT  TAP 
is at the end.
For Marketers, alphabetically starts at door into Fax Center and continues 
from left to right into the bottom row of curve.
Naturally, from inside Fax Center, alphabet starts with A's to the right and 
continues around.

Thanks and if you have any problems with any of this, please let me know.
