August 1st is just around the corner, and that's your deadline for entering 
the "private drawing" at this year's Sporting Clays Tournament.  If we have 
your registration and payment by next Tuesday, your name goes in the hat for 
a great shotgun!

Visit our website at www.houstonenergy.org for the details of this awesome 
event, and send in your registration today!  Look forward to seeing you 
there...
