 I have eight tickets for this Friday and Saturday to the Texaco Grand Prix. 
If you would like the tickets to take customers please let me know. First 
come first served. In case of a tie we will use a lottery system but you must 
notify me ahead  of time if you wish to witness the lottery (sound familiar?).
