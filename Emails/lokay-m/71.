Patti will be leaving us on June 30th so I thought it would be nice to have a 
happy hour from all her friends/coworkers in Market Services.    The happy 
hour place will be Ninfa's on Thursday, June 29th at 5:00 p.m.
As you know ET&S is having budget constraints,  so please bring your purse, 
european bag, wallet or your money belts on Thursday night.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at X31848.
