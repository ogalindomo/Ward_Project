There will be two changes to the EnronOnline Website, effective for Monday 
morning:

1) There will be a new release for internal users only, which should fix the 
freeze-up of floating windows which some users have reported.
2) The old version of EnronOnline (the vesion without the news and weather 
content) will no longer be available.

The old version will be retired to make way for new functionality such as the 
Spreads product, which will allow customers to simultaneously transact in 
both of the underlying legs of a spread simultaneously.

Some customers are still transacting through the old version of the 
EnronOnline website. We are making every effort to contact all such customers 
directly, but it is possible they may call you, complaining that their 
website doesn't work. If this happens, please do the following:

1) Explain that the new version of the website is just as fast as the old 
version, but has additional functionality, like floating windows, news and 
weather.
2) Explain that there are solutions for any technical difficulties they might 
have in upgrading
3) Transfer them to Product Control for additional assistance.
