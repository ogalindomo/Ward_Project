Subject: Deal Profitability Training

On Wed 6/28 Dave Foti will present to us the new Deal Profitability System 
being implemented via the Intranet.  This system will help us better 
understand the actual profitability of transport deals we negotiate relative 
to the fuel consumed while taking into account other utilization factors on 
the pipe.

Meeting will be held from 2-3pm in room 48c1
