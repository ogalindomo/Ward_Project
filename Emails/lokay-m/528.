Enterprise Products Partners L.P. said its operating partnership has
executed a definitive agreement to purchase Acadian Gas, LLC from Coral
Energy, LLC, an affiliate of Shell Oil Company, for $226 million in cash,
inclusive of working capital.

Acadian's assets are comprised of the Acadian, Cypress and Evangeline
natural gas pipeline systems, which together include over 1,000 miles of
pipeline and have over one billion cubic feet per day of capacity. The
system includes a leased natural gas storage facility at Napoleonville, LA

The acquisition expands Enterprise Products' platform of fee-based,
midstream energy services to include natural gas transportation and storage.
Completion of this transaction is subject to certain conditions, including
regulatory approvals. The purchase is expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter of 2000.
