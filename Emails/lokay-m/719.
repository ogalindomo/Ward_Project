Kern River has scheduled semi-annual inspections for the Solar turbine 
compressors at Muddy Creek (WY) Station for Nov. 7-10. No interruptible 
service will be available during this period except at the PG&E Daggett and 
Oxy 17Z receipt points. Primary capacity behind Muddy Creek will be 
restricted to about 310 MMcf/d and allocated.
