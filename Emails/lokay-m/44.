Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.
