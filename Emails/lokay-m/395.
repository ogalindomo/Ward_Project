Lindy and Michelle--

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss DealBench and 
the IOS process.  I will work with my technical team to schedule a meeting 
sometime next week with you and Rich Abromowitz. 

Michelle-- when you get a chance, can you please fax to my attention the 
screen shots from an IOS auction that contained some of the complexities we 
discussed yesterday?  I have verified that Enron Net Works is a separate 
legal entity from ENA so I think we are okay from that standpoint.  My fax 
number is 713-646-8576.

Thanks so much,

Ross Mesquita
