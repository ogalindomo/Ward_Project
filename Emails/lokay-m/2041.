Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: The Storm Continues
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2199


Overview: Although weather has allowed some break in gas prices over the past 
two weeks,
the pressure in the market remains. Storage inventories look likely to reach
record low levels by the end of February, with a month of winter still to 
come.
This pressure means

* The 4.4 Bcf per day of demand currently priced out of the gas market is
likely to remain out of the market through February.

* Henry Hub price is expected to average $8.00 per MMBtu for February.
