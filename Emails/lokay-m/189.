Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy 
on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a 
bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button 
does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 
100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
throughput.  Does this make sense?  Let me know if there are any problems.
