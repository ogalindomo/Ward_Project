I hope that you found the August 25 electric class informative and thought 
provoking.  I 'm sure that in some cases the material was too basic and in 
other cases the information was more than you wanted or needed.

Please send me some feedback on the class, including:

How were the speakers?  Did you enjoy Jim Crist and John Adamiak?  Would you 
prefer having an Enron speaker or an outside speaker at any future electric 
sessions?

Did the class cover the right topics?  Are there any additional areas for 
which you are looking for information?

Do the written materials suit your needs?

How about the setting?  Was the whiteboard instruction approach useful?

Other thoughts?
