Come to eSpeak Thursday, October 12 at 10:00 am Houston time. Cindy Olson, 
executive vice president of Human Resources and Community Affairs, will 
conduct an "open-mike" session on the year-end PRC process.
Remember:  You can post your question for Cindy's eSpeak at any time before 
her event on the eSpeak site.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting that didn't get answered?  
Have no fear; eMeet is here!  We are in the process of answering outstanding 
questions and will soon post the responses in a special eMeet category:  
All-Employee Meeting Questions.  Catchy, isn't it?
Keep an eye on upcoming eThink About It memos for details on the arrival of 
the answers.
And, in case you're curious, there is another anonymous Office of the 
Chairman posting just waiting in eMeet for you to read it!
