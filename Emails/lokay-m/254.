Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force 
majeure situation on 
Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by 
next Monday's 
gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance 
originally scheduled 
for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done 
this week to minimize 
disruptions during August, Williams said.
