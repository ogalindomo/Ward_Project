Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center

Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair 
International Oil 

and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 
600-MW natural gas-fired 

electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, 
CA. The $275 million Teayawa

 Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Indians' land through a long-term 

lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. 

Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial 
operation slated to begin in 

late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line 
adjacent to the property. 

As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting 
agency under the National

Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
Additionally, BIA approval is necessary 

to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, 
environmental and economic 

considerations of the Torres Martinez.
