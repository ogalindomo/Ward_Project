Well believe it or not, it's almost Fall again.  And, of course, that means 
time for back to school, football, cooler weather (that means under 100 
degrees in Houston) and our annual marketing affiliate compliance seminar.

While we hold these sessions on an annual basis to ensure our continued 
compliance with FERC's standards of conduct, the session will not simply be a 
repeat of last year's materials.  Each year we try to focus on new aspects of 
the rules.  This year our sessions will focus on:

? Maintaining our web site in compliance with the rules
? Handling e-mail requests and inquiries from marketing affiliates
? The implications of new electronic tools - EOL, eThink, etc.

In addition, we have prepared some fun video examples to illustrate day to 
day application of the rules.

The session will last only 1 hour from 8:30 - 9:30 AM in 5C2.  Last year you 
let me know that you expected refreshments - so I'm happy to report that 
donuts and coffee will be served.

All Houston-based marketing, finance and operations staff receiving this 
e-mail need to attend a session on Tuesday, October 10.  This session is 
designed to address specific issues which are concerns for these groups.
