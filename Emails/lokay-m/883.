Houston folks may want to schedule their own time to listen.  This call was

In a November 17, 2000, CERA multimedia conference call and web presentation, 
Ed Kelly, CERA Director, and 
Bryan Sanderson, CERA Associate, discuss: 

WINTER WEATHER SCENARIOS: BRACING FOR THE STORM 
* Demand potential under cold, normal, and warm weather 
conditions this winter. A return to normal weather will 
push demand well above last year's levels. 
* Storage outlook. How low can it go? 
* Price. Limited demand flexibility and low storage 
levels will continue to drive prices through the winter.
