You are scheduled to be migrated on or about Feb 20.  Two tasks that we need 
you to accomplish before this date are....1. Create your Notes internet 
password and 2. Determine if you have Notes address book groups that need to 
be copied.  Setting your Notes internet password will allow you to see all 
your old notes messages after you are migrated to Windows 2000 (since only 
the last 30 days worth will be carried over to Outlook).  Copying your Notes 
address book groups will allow those groups to be carried over to Windows 
2000 as well.  The migration team will need to visit your desk while you are 
logged in to initiate the group copy.  All your business cards will 
automatically be migrated, so there is no other action required for them.  
 Please reply and let me know when you have accomplished the following:
Create Notes Internet Password Before Migration
1. Go to your Notes Workspace
2. Double click on Enron Address Book
3. Under People search, type in your name, Highlight your name
4. Double click to open


5. Click on Edit Person
6. Scroll down to Internet Password, type in password
7. Click on Save and Close

Do You Have Notes Address Book Groups?

1.  Double-click on your "Address Book on Local" button


2.  Select "Groups" in the left window
3.  If you have any groups in addition to "LocalDomainServers" and 
"OtherDomainServers" then they will need to be copied over. (So let me know 
when you reply to this message) 


IMPORTANT!

Reply back to this message and let me know that you've set your Notes 
Internet password, and also let me know if you have Notes address book groups 
that need to be copied. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask those too. 
Thanks!
