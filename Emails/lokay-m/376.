The attached file contains a list of the variables we identified in our 
August 18th meeting.  I tried to break them down into smaller group just for 
organizational purposes.  The items under Prices and Temperatures should be 
easy to gather using the LIM database.  The items in the Other category may 
require more research.  What we have done in the past if we could not find 
the exact variable try and fine a proxy for it.  For example it may be 
difficult to find irrigation usage, but less difficult to find precipitation 
in a region.  Since these two items would intuitively seem to have an inverse 
relationship it may be possible to use precipitation as a proxy for 
irrigation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have 
to come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We 
added a column for use to keep track of the statues on each variable this is 
just for us to keep track of where we found the variable or why we did not 
pursue it.  Let me know if we have missed anything or you have subsequently 
thought of anything not on the list.
