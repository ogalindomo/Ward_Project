FERC Approves Questar Pipeline

     The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million
pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from
the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the
Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the
environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil
pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline
will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be
built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West
Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico
and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The
West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per
day.
