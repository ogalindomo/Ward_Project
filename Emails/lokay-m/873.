WESTERN ENERGY MONTHLY BRIEFING:
PRICES REMAIN HIGH AND VOLATILE
Winter arrived with a bang last week, and the wild ride
in western gas and power markets continues. The early
cold together with maintenance outages on pipelines and
power plants, strong pulls on gas, and low storage
inventories pushed gas prices to new highs.

* Topock prices pushed over $10.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) in mid-November, with Sumas and
Malin hitting $8.00. These price run-ups are likely to
continue.

* The pipeline-constrained Topock and Malin markets will
see swings from $6.00 to $12.00 per MMBtu on a week-to-
week-basis.

* November's cold snap demonstrated what CERA has
anticipated: continued power price strength and
volatility during the year due to gas and power market
supply tightness.
