Please attend a meeting on Wednesday, 2/14 from 1:00-2:00 in EB4194 to review 
the high level requirements captured from our previous meeting.   The purpose 
of this meeting will be to make some decisions on the categories needed for 
your Dashboard and then set up a process to determine the sources or 
documents for each link.    

We were very encouraged by your participation in our Kick-off meeting and 
look forward to working with all of you!   Please contact Bobby or myself if 
you cannot attend.   

 Thanks!   Martha
