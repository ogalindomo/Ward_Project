Storage withdrawals have slowed markedly in recent weeks, attributable to both
losses of demand and warm weather. CERA estimates that storage withdrawals for
January have averaged approximately 18.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day.

* End-of-winter inventories are expected to be near 600 Bcf.

* Prices must remain high to keep demand off of the market.

* There is still potential for weather-related volatility.
