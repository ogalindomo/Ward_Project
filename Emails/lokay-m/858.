El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup.
