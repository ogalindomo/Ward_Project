Commercialize your intelligence on the Edge this week.  How?  Go to the Edge 
and post information that might grab someone else's interest.  That "someone 
else" views your information and uses it to competitively position Enron.  
It's that easy.


It's another "Big 2" week for eSpeak!
Tuesday, October 17 at 10:00 am Houston time, join Steve Hotte, vice 
president and CIO of Enron Transportation Services.  Steve will conduct an 
"open mike" session about technology at ETS.
Thursday, October 19 at 10:00 am Houston time, Shelly Payne, benefits 
supervisor, and Sandy Huseman, senior benefits analyst, will be on eSpeak to 
answer your questions about Open Enrollment.
Don't forget:  You can post your questions before either of these events on 
the eSpeak site.


Cindy Olson's eSpeak on Enron's PRC process last week was very popular.  If 
you'd like to continue the discussion, go to eMeet and post your comments in 
the "PRC Process" category.
