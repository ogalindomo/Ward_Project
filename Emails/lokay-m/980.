from NGI's Daily Gas Price Index Dec 13, 2000 

In an attempt to capture the price discovery offered in the rapidly expanding 
electronic exchange market, NGI is adding a new price report to its website. 
"NGI's Electronic Platform Trading Index" will be comprised of deals done 
each morning before 11:30 a.m. Central Time and will be published on its 
website at http://intelligencepress.com by 1 p.m. Central Time each business 
day. 

The new service starts today with independently-audited quotes from 
EnronOnline. NGI is actively soliciting quotes from other exchanges, which 
will be added as they become available. NGI will compile an index (NGIX) from 
the data submitted. To become part of the exchange index, please contact 
Dexter Steis at 703-318-8848. 

NGI will continue to publish the results of its own extensive price surveys, 
which include both off-line and online transactions. The separate publication 
of the electronic indices is intended as a supplement to provide information 
on the rapidly growing exchange trading in a timely manner. The electronic 
exchange indices will be available on NGI's website at mid-day and also will 
be printed in the next day's NGI's Daily Gas Price Index.
