In our effort to continue to develop the Marketing Dashboard to meet your 
needs and to help you manage your business, we are rolling out our next 
release of the Marketing Dashboard.   We have taken your feedback from the 
survey as well as added additional functionality that will enhance the 
effectiveness.   Below is a list of the new functionality & features:

* Created a new graphical design with multiple pages using 'tabs' to organize 
the information better 
* Created a tab labeled 'My Pipeline' for you to customize with the 
categories of your choice
* Added a specific tab for NNG as well as the ability to add multiple 
pipelines in the future
* Additional business and market intelligence categories have been added 
through secondary tabs
* Created an Alert bar to allow you to identify specific conditions to notify 
you through the Dashboard
* Ability to add security to individual categories on the portal

Here are a few simple steps to take to access the new site:

1) From Internet Explorer 5.0, enter the link below or click on it here to 
access:
 http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/

2) You will be required to put in a new I.D. and password - the ID & 
passwords are the same as your LAN id: 
 * It is the initial of your first name followed by seven digits of your last 
name 
 (ex. mjanouse for both ID & password)

3) The new Dashboard will appear with defaults in each tab: 
 * You can then customize according to your needs and interests.
 * The default will prompt you to the 'My Pipeline' tab;
  - This tab contains categories from the NNG tab but with personalization 
features
  - You can remove categories from here if you do not use them in your 
day-to-day
 * The NNG tab is the replication of most of the categories from our current 
Dashboard:
  -  Some categories have been moved to other tabs.   (ex. Weather )
 * To save this new Dashboard as your 'homepage', please do the following:
  - Go to the top right utility navigation bar which says 'set as your 
homepage' 
  - Click on it and then when the window comes up for verification, click OK
  - Now, when you log on to your PC, click on the IE5 symbol 
  - Please delete current shortcut on your desktop to old Dashboard 

Here are a few notes and helpful hints to make your dashboard experience a 
joyful one:

Favorites -  Favorites are now called links and are available in the upper 
right content of each tab.  You can create as many link categories as you 
like and you may now group similar links by entering a custom title when you 
edit your list.
Memo -  The Memo pad allows you to jot yourself a note without leaving the 
dashboard.  You can create as many memo pads as you like.
