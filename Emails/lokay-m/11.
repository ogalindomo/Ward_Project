Subject: TW Cash for Fuel meeting

Please plan to attend a follow up meeting to discuss possible system changes 
needed to implement TW Cash for fuel tariff changes. The IT staff is in the 
process ot trying to prepare a draft estimate for system cost, and have many 
questions on this process.  I have attached the  draft of system changes that 
I put together last month based on the meeting that we had with marketing.  
We will be discussing this list of proposed system requirements to determine 
if additional changes are needed.

The meeting is Wednesday 6/14/00 at 9:00 to 10:30 in room 4053A



Thanks Ramona
