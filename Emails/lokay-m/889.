Market Services are the schedulers (Cynthia, Amy, Burt, Linda Ward, Terry, 
etc.)...how about Contract Administration (Elizabeth Brown, Dale Eldridge)?

Subject: Christmas Luncheon

Steve mentioned to me this afternoon that he would like to include everyone 
working with the TW Commercial Group, Staff Meeting Participants and the 
Market Service people, Engineering (i.e, Mansoor, etc.) as well.

I have the list of Staff Meeting Participants, but am not sure which Market 
Service Personnel to invite.  Please Help!!! :)
