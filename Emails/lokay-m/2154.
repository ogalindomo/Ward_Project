The Marketing migration to Windows 2000/Outlook has been delayed until the 
week of February 20.  I am very concerned with applications and I want to 
make sure everything is 100% ready before we move forward.  

Some of the activities originally scheduled for the week of February 5th will 
move forward as planned.   Users will be contacted on an individual basis.

If you have any questions regarding the Windows 2000/Outlook migration, 
please contact me directly.   I apologize for any problems this delay in 
schedule may have caused.

Thanks.  Jean 87-7173  /pager 1-877-506-6529


PS -- If you are already on Windows 2000 and Outlook please disregard this
