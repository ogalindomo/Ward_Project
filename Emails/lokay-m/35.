This worked out better the last time.  Either you did not bother to launch 
and read this or you liked the pdf file better.  Either way, I received a lot 
less negative feedback!  So, I'm doing it again.  I am sending you the pdf 
file.  Double click on the attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different way, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.
