I am sending this email out as a "For Your Information".  If you have any 
questions, please contact the helpdesk or myself!

When your LAN password expires on to NNGOMAHA the new "grace login" setting 
is 3 (changed from 6).  You will only have 3 attempts to change your 
password.  Call the helpdesk if you need assistance.

The new standard browser for GPG is Internet Explorer, Netscape will no 
longer be installed on desktops.

Any software that you have installed on your desktop will not be reinstalled 
if you need to have your desktop rebuilt.

The Helpdesk's normal business hours are 7:00 am to 6:00 pm.  Normal business 
hours means someone from the LAN team is in the building.  If you require 
emergency assistance after hours or during business hours please call the 
Helpdesk and mark the message urgent and the on-call person will be paged.  
Please remember - to mark a message urgent you must first leave a detailed 
message and then press * # 3.  

Please call the Helpdesk for all helpdesk/desktop related issues.    We are 
currently implementating Remedy -- GPG's new Helpdesk application for 
tracking tickets and more!  Calling us directly may not get you the best 
possible service!   I will still be the escalation person for all issues or 
concerns.

Diane Becker will be joining the LAN Team starting on June 26, please stop by 
the 2nd floor and Welcome Diane back to Omaha!

Thanks, Jean x7173
