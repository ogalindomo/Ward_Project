El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that 
will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit 
scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system 
integrity. 

Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to 
maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its 
imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant 
shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance 
in effect.
