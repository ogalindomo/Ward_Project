Time:  2:30 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 

HoustonStreet Exchange has branched out into realms of the top energy 
e-commerce 
platforms today by signing an agreement to post the North American 
electricity and 
natural gas prices of EnronOnline. The prices will be posted automatically on 
HoustonStreet.com and traders will be able to act on the EnronOnline prices 
via either 
platform. The addition of EnronOnline pricing will correspond with the launch 
of 
HoustonStreet's natural gas platform in September, the companies said.

Enron also signed an agreement today to post its gas and power prices 
simultaneously 
on True Quote.com. EnronOnline has conducted commodity transactions worth 
more 
than $90 billion in 2000. It posts two-way prices for more than 800 products 
in global 
energy and commodities markets.
