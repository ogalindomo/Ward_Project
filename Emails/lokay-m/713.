Subject: Long term Basis quotes

As part of our ongoing effort to analyze Rocky Mnt. opportunities, I've 
secured the following (mid-market) basis quotes from Sempra Trading:

Term  1-year  5-year  10-year

Cal. Brdr. + 0.280  + 0.250  + 0.240

Permian - 0.130  - 0.1175  - 0.110

San Juan - 0.335  - 0.245  - 0.220

Rockies * - 0.480  - 0.420  - 0.380

* Rockies quoted from NWPL at Opal.  CIG North typically trades $0.04 - 0.06 
back from these figures.
