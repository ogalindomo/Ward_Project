On Monday, September 11, Jean McFarland will meet with our team to briefly 
give an overview of the upcoming installation of Windows 2000.    We will try 
to devote the last 15 minutes of staff meeting time to Jean.   Unlike the 
conference room on the 42nd floor, we will have to be out of EB-4102 by 
10:45am for Julia's Staff Meeting.    This will mean giving abbreviated 
reports. 

Please place this date and time on your calendars.

Thanks in advance,
