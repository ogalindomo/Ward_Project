Good morning, hope everyone had a great weekend!!!  Now let's get back to 
helping millions.  Don't forget to fill out your online pledge card before 
the "Sundae Wednesday."  And remember, we will be having "Million dollar 
Sundaes" on Wednesday in front of the copy machine where the celebrations are 
usually held.

If you need assistance with your online pledge card please feel free to give 
me a call at ext. 3-7571.

Thanks,

Pam
