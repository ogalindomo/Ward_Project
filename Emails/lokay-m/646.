ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams
 
Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year 
agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation 
service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. 

"We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to 
its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve 
its growing energy needs in Oklahoma," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice 
president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas 
systems). 

Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new 
meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said 
the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing 
customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. 
The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma 
City and Enid, OK, markets.
