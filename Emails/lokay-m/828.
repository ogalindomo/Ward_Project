After canceling last week's Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Friday 
(see Daily GPI, Nov. 13), El Paso reinstated the OFO Monday until further 
notice. The Window Rock (AZ) B Station was brought back partially online late 
Saturday afternoon, causing the previous 250 MMcf/d reduction of North 
Mainline capacity to fall to 150 MMcf/d. That level of constraint will remain 
in effect until the next block of compression becomes available sometime this 
week, the pipeline said.
