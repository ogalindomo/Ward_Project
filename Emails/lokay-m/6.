"A man with a new idea is a crank until he succeeds."
-Mark Twain

Innovation, itself, is nothing new.  The word comes to us from the Latin 
innovatus, which is a good indication of how long the concept has been 
around.  People have been searching for the "next big thing" for thousands of 
years.

We have quite a tradition of innovation here at Enron.  Although consistent 
innovation may sound like an oxymoron, we pride ourselves on consistently 
outpacing our peers with innovative ideas.

How do you think Enron can maintain its edge into the new century?  What will 
be our "next big thing?"  Put your best foot forward, visit eMeet and share 
your ideas in "Creativity and Innovation" that will keep Enron at the top.
