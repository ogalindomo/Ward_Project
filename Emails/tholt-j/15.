Jane, Southwest Gas shorted ENA  $16,386.19 for liquidated damages they claim 
occurred in November (see email below).  I have not received the support from 
SWG but have asked them to fax me a copy.  How would you like me to handle?

Enron incurred $16,386.19 in Liquidated Damages for the month of November.  I 
mailed a copy of them to your attention on 12/26.  Most of the fallouts were 
due to CPR and PRR which means Enron failed to perform their obligation to 
supply gas.  Nancy
