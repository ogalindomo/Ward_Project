Jane, I just faxed the January penalty support.  Also, you mentioned that we 
should be billing penalties on the trigger deal - 386140 (EPNG - Blanco 
Supply Area).  However, this deal is linked to the same contract as the 
penalty for the nomination error.  I have checked the contract again, and all 
of the exhibits are expired.  In addition, I cannot find an exhibit which 
covers EPNG-Blanco Supply Area.  Given this information, would you still like 
me to bill the penalty, and if so, at what rate?

Thanks for your help
Laurie
