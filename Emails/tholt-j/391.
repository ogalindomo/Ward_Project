Dear Jane,
I received your the box of cajun spices yesterday. I will be trying them out
soon.
Hope all is well with you guys, and you made it back with a lot of fun
memories!! I really enjoyed seeing you all!!
Julie, Barb's daughter, has asked me to provide her with e-mail addresses
for the aunts and uncles. Let me know if you're comfortable with me passing
on your e-mail address to her.
Hope to see you sooner!
Frank
