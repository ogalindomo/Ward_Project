<< Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.
 Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and
 Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was
 so relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana
 over Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I
 are taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your
 ranch, is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly
 into Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date
 because I love to hike.

You could come into Colorado Springs,but it would add 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours
to your commute.  There used to be a price advantage, but I don't think there
is anymore, unless you've checked recently.  The cabin is about 2 hours
northwest of DIA.  It's great hiking!  Let's find a time!!!!  How are Jackie
and Dan??
