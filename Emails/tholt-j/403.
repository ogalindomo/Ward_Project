She likes white wines like white burgundy--I don't know any of the exact 
ones, but I can find out if you want me to.

Another idea she would really like is a gift certificate to the Taste of 
Texas.  She went there recently for the first time and really enjoyed it.

Subject: Appreciation Gift for Patti

We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.
