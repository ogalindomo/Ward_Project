Dorg men,
?
There's been another liver lover added to the Homecoming list...class of  '75 
brother Craig Shackleton.? Click,click,click,click,click.? Bill  Haack is 
trying to work things out so that he can make an appearance, as is JD  Owen.? 
We remain hopeful.
?
Mike Arends is a mysto.? I've sent a note and left a message at his  home and 
still no word???
?
Whoever put my name on the golf list has a terrific sense of humor...and  
I'll prove it!
?
No singing this time, but there are a couple more pictures attached.
