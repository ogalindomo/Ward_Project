Dear Richard,

As per my conversation with Jeff Skilling last week in which he suggested 
that I contact you, I would like to request the names of the companies who we 
outsource some of our accounting needs to.  I would like to target them for 
our latest product: Data Storage Capacity.  Please let me know how you would 
like me to proceed regarding this matter.  Thank you.
