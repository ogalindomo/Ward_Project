Hello Jeff,
Just read the email about your new appointment. I ve never seen you cos I 
work in London and I only just started 3 1/2 weeks ago. I have only seen your 
picture. I want to wish you all the very best in your new role that is 
effective from february. I love ENRON and I love the way you guys up there 
run the company. Congrats and God bless you.
Labo
