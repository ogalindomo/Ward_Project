Jeff,

Hope all is well with you. I'm just dropping you this note to let you know I
haven't forgotten your call concerning the sale of your share in the Rio
house...I've been extremely busy getting my immigration status in order and
setting up my company in London.

I've also asked Price Waterhouse to update all the accounts of Swanswalk Ltd
in Ireland (the company that owns the house) and see the best way forward
for a potential transaction seeking to minimize Brazilian and Irish taxes.

My personal matters should take me a few more weeks and I will contact you
to discuss the house shortly thereafter.

Regards,

Diomedes.
