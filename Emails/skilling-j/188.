Join the fun at the ISUZU MS 150 Post-Tour Awards Party! Did you raise$400 or 
more? If so, you qualify for a fabulous fundraising prize that you can pick 
up at the party! (Don't forget, you can choose to "donate your prize back" to 
the Lone Star Chapter, too).   The individual and team awards will be 
announced, so you won't want to miss this exciting event! Rumor has it that 
the Tour raised over $3 million, and the Enron team is now at $512,946.00.  
Please come and help us celebrate this record-breaking occasion!

 If you have paid your minimum pledge of $200 and RSVP, you will receive an 
"I DID IT" t-shirt at the party. Sorry, only those who
attend the party are eligible to receive the free t-shirt. No t-shirts will 
be available after the party.
