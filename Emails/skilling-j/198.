Jeff,
We've never met, but as a long time geophysical consultant to EOG and now
EGEP I thought I'd send a congratulatory  note from a fellow MS150 rider on
your top fundraising achievement announced last night at the Awards evening.
It's good to know that there's time to ride in what must be a very busy
schedule.

Best regards,
