Brothers,
?
Keep the messages coming.? Your messages are laugh out loud  funny.? My wife 
wishes she were a Beta and could get in on the fun  to.? For example, in 
response to our selection of Lakewood Landing for  Thursday night- Jim Dent 
writes:

Beek:

"I regret to inform you  that the Lakewood Landing is a gay bar. Looks like 
some of the brothers will  have to go in drag. Get it, Elvis."

I sent this message to Tom Benson and he  responded:
?
"No wonder everyone was so  friendly!? That explains the bathrooms being 
marked "shipping" and  "receiving" ." 

Tom 

Shortly thereafter, I get a message (Anderson, you're  gunna like this) from 
Bill Jansson:
"There is no problem so large,that it can not be overcome by  the use of
high-explosives." LTjg Bill Jansson,USN-1983
?
Bill also included the a photograph. (see  attached).
?
Another source of great entertainment was the copy from  the SMU Alumni 
On-line Newsletter that John Miller circulated.? I couldn't  help suspecting 
the influence of the Drow factor.? I hope the responsible  party will humbly 
step forward and receive the clicks due him for such a  creative and humorous 
piece of writing that captured the essence of a 'Gamma  Omega' Beta. 
?
Many clicks,
BEEK
