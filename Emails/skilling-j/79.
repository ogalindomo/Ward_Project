Jeff:

I am sending you a business plan for a financial SettlementMatrix.  This is a
marketplace that will handle all payments, settlements and risk/arbitrage
associated with B2B marketplaces.

I would like to discuss the potential for Enron to participate as an equity
owner in SettlementMatrix.  We are moving this very rapidly.  I will discuss
this with you when we talk on Wednesday.

Regards,
Greg
