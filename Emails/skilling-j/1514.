Mr. Skilling,

I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I was leaving NewPower.
My last day at NewPower should be in the week to come.

Foremost, I wanted to thank you for the time you have given me while I was at 
Enron and NewPower.
This past year at NewPower has been a very intense and intellectually 
lucrative learning experience, which have brought me many skills.
My experience at both companies has been wonderful, fruitful and exciting.

I was glade to see that the NewPower/Enron Employee program faired well.

Best continuation, as President & CEO of Enron Corp and to your family.
Will look forward to the chance of meeting with you again.


Regards,
Wilson Kriegel



I have attach my resume, so you would see the opportunities and experience I 
have gained at Enron & NewPower.
