Hi Jeff,
It was good talking to you last week!  The dates for the Aspen conference
that we talked about are Sept. 20, 21,  and 22.   We would want to target
one of those mornings.   Thanks again for agreeing to join us as a presenter
(and for any additional part of the conference as well).

We'll be in touch to zero in on the specifics.  Thanks again,

Bill
