Here are a few pictures you might enjoy.? The  brothers are all dressed up, 
so it must have been a "spring formal" or  something... but who can remember 
back a quarter century?? Are the guys  that were not wearing ties practicing 
the proverbial "Beta no  date-a"?
?
The 5 Betas are Jeff Skilling, Tom McSoley, Rene  Molina, Rob Bugh and Chuck 
Peterson.? Check out Bugh - looks like he's  posing for GQ.

Thompson, Molina, Baddour, Bugh, Zaremba,  Skilling, Stewart, Peeler.? In
