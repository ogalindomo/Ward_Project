Jeff:

This is to follow up on my conversation with you last November. At that time 
I had indicated an interest in moving from GTB in Bolivia to other job within 
Enron where I can utilize my experience more effectively.  You advised me to 
talk to Jeff McMahon at EIM because you felt my background fits well in his 
organization. Since than I have been trying to close a number of critical 
items at GTB. I am happy to report great progress. I talked to Jeff regarding 
my interest in EIM on Monday. He has indicated a strong interest in me.  I am 
looking forward to hearing from him soon. I would appreciate your support in 
this. I agree with you that EIM is a great fit for my experience. I really 
feel I can contribute significantly in Jeff's efforts in expanding markets in 
Europe.
