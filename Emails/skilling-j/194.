In our continuing efforts to become a "paperless" chapter, we will make
every effort to transmit information regarding programs, events and
announcements to you by e-mail.  The attached 2000/2001 Calendar of Events
for the Houston Chapter will also be mailed to each YPOer at his/her office
and residence in the form of a post card this week.

We are very excited about the upcoming events scheduled for this program
year and hope you will be also.
