Thanks to the efforts of Chuck Paul we have added to more brothers to our  
Beta message list.? They are: Jim Glass and Clay Coburn.? I'm sure  that it 
is only a matter of time before I can report that they too will be  joining 
the party in Dallas.
?
I've received a couple of ideas for a rendezvous for dinner on Thursday  
evening of HC weekend.? The first was from Jim Dent.? He suggests that  we 
chow down at The Double Tree and Central Expressway.? John Grumbles had  
another idea and elaborated: 
?
??????? "Fred: Gordo's is  reopened and has the same pizza. I can try to get 
us  ??????? an area set aside for Thursday  night
??????? if you wish. Also, right  down the street is the Time Out Tavern,  
shuffle
??????? board , pool, hole in the  wall with Harley's.
??????? Last time  Woody was there, he had to spend the night at my house;  
??????? last time Elvis was there he got into  
??????? small encounter that spilled  into the parking lot. Could be fun. 
Ask  the
??????? brothers and I'll set it  up."
