Dear Friend: 

The 3rd annual Forbes-Milken Institute Best Places Ranking was released 
today, showing what cities are the best for business and careers.

What city do you think is number one this year? Well, just go to 
http://www.milkeninstitute.org or http://www.forbes.com/bestplaces to find 
out.

This annual ranking of the top 200 metropolitan areas in the United States 
(with a separate ranking for 94 small metros) looks at which metros are the 
most dynamic based on jobs and earnings growth, and high-technology growth 
and output. 

All of the numbers were provided by the Institute's Regional and Demographic 
Studies group as part of its ongoing research into how high-tech impacts 
regional economies.

If you have any questions about the Forbes-Milken Institute ranking, or if 
you wish more information about the Institute or the high-tech work of the 
Regional Studies group, please contact us at (310) 998-2600.

We hope this is of interest to you.
