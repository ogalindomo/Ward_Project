The Thursday  Night question has been answered!
?
Rob Rossell and his brother Bill have  come through.? It's gunna be Lakewood  
Landing.? For a little insurance and your piece of mind, we  sent Tom Benson 
on a little reconnaissance mission.? His report  below:
?
"Yeah - I went by there.? Definitely our kind of place.  Looks like we can 
get as rowdy as we want.? They have got burgers, booze  and pool.? Plenty big 
enough and Bill said it's pretty hard to offend their  customers.? I told him 
its not like we were 19 year olds, just a bunch of  40 somethings who still 
think they are 19 year olds!"
?
They feature a variety of barley brews, Rock 'n Rye and Haig & Haig,  but no 
Zodiac yet.
?
Many clicks to Rob and Tom.
?
Address:????????5818 Live Oak  (Skillman and Live Oak) 1 mile off lower
Greenville.? We'll provide more  detailed directions later.
