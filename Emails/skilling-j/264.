Brother Tools,
   As of this date, I, your hard working ticket procurement master, have
only heard from Mannino, Beek, Jordan, Kretz, Wallace, Elvis, Grumbles,
Glass, C-Paul, John Miller, and Space re: ordering tickets to sit with the
brothers of the pail.  I'm figuring I've got about two more weeks to wait to
place the order to ensure we all get block seating, so....if you're wanting
to sit within the Eye of Wooglin section, which, by the way, WILL OWN THE
FRICKING STADIUM THAT DAY, you kinda need to let me know as soon as you can.
  I'll be sending this message a few more times, so get used to it
dirtballs.
    See you at the game.

Yours in -kai-,
  Drow

PS.  Who in the hell bid Ricky Baier?
PSS. Feel free to forward this to any brother not on this list.
