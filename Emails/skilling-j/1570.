Jeff, I've attached a copy of the letter describing
the loan of the Madeline O'Connor piece to the McNay
Museum in San Antonio this summer. Please let me or
Betty Moody at Moody Gallery know if you have any
questions. Also, have you had a chance to make a
decision about a piece for the niche between the boys'
rooms? Thanks. Leigh Edwards
