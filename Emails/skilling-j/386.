Thank you for taking the time to stop and speak with my wife and I at the EES 
Christmas Party.  We realize you had numerous people to meet and greet.  I 
was serious and very sincere when I said that Enron, under your leadership, 
has grown into one of the most successful and innovative companies in the 
world.  

I am personally looking forward to being a major part of Enron's future.  
Have a wonderful Holiday season and I look forward to a 2001 that is beyond 
anyone's expectations.
