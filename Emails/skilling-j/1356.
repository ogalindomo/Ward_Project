While you were gone I've been working hard in the interest of Boston
University!  As a result you will be hearing from a Mr. Jeffrey Skilling
and his daughter Kristen from Houston, Texas.

They were in town Friday for a visit. They went to the reception center
and took the tour.  They were favorably impressed. Kristen is a junior
and will probably be applying next year.

I told Mr. Skilling about you and was wondering when/if you could meet
Kristen. I don't think she will be coming back up here immediately. But
you visit schools in Houston and go to open houses there, don't you? At
the very least you could talk on the telephone.

If it is alright with you I'm giving him your email address and you
three could communicate. She will be an excellent candidate.  Her scores
are good and she plays field hockey and is a competitive swimmer.

Thanks Jane and welcome back,

Kay
