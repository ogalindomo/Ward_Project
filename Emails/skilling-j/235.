What ever became of Dan Bates anyway?? I don't know, but Bill Jannsson  
e-mailed to say that he was coming to the party to provide some adult  
leadership.? Jim Wallace is a yes, according to a recent message I received  
from him.? And Elvis assures me that Paul Porter is a definite YES!
?
Let's hear some more from our brothers in the classes of '72, '73, '74 and  
'76.? And what about you guys in the upper mid west?? Pretty quiet up  
there.? I might have to unleash Woody on you.? Here's a sampling of  his 
persuasive cajoling:
?
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  "...and??Dr. 
Fullerton is trying to clear 
his heart transplant  calendar as we speak.? I said to him, "Fu, what's more 
important, a  fricking heart transplant or a chance to end up face down in 
the gutter with  your pledge brothers?"? Think it really hit home with him on 
that  one.? I mean, what can you say to THAT? Should be a new low.? Can't  
wait." 
?
He's got a way with words.
