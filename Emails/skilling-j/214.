FYI
FirstWorld announced the company would not meet its projections for the next 
3 quarters and the resignation of CEO Sheldon Ohringer.

The stock is trading at less than $4.00 per share (near our original basis).  
We sold 80% of our position for $10.55 ($130 million).  ENA still holds 3 
million warrants.
