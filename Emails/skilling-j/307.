Beta Thursday Night Gang,
?
Significant progress has been made in our quest to locate an alternate  venue 
for our Thursday night rendezvous.
?
The suggestion actually came from Queensbury, NY of all places.? Yes,  
brother Rob Rossell ('77) has volunteered his brother Bill's  
establishment....Lakewood Landing.? Tom Benson says it's near Stan's Blue  
Note Inn.
?
A brief description, details and directions will follow.
?
I spoke to Mike Arends today...it looks like Mike will be joining us in  
spite of the fact that he will be at the alter 2 weeks later.? Rob Rossell  
tells me that Tim Strange is coming down with Harry Singleton.? The  brothers 
just keep on coming out of the woodwork.? Rob Bugh got into the  loop only 
recently- too late to make plans to leave the flock behind.
?
Though he's become a silver-gray, his hand keeps time and measure...check  
out Elvis doin' the hambone thing (attachment).? A Beta Top 40 included  too! 
(don't worry Jansson, I still have my day job)
