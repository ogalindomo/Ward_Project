No Beta reunion weekend would be complete without the Beta Brunch at the
Benson=01,s.  We will be serving Sunday Morning from 9:30 AM until we kick
the last Beta out of the house.  The menu is still being prepared, but
rest assured that there will be some good Zodiac vodka around the house
for Bloody Mary=01,s, Screwdrivers, Martini=01,s, Jello Shots or whatever i=
t
takes to erase the pain from three days of partying.

Below is a photo of C-Di enjoying some of that Benson Beta Brunch
hospitality.

Shoot me an e-mail and let me know asap  if you will be hanging around
for the brunch.  (Directions to follow)
