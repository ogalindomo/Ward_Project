Hi everyone,

One of my fellow Turkish students had a fancy camera, and took a picture
of me on top of a mountain above Istanbul on the Asain side.  He sent it
too me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version I
have isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind me
is the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connects
the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbul
in two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,
and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and the
portion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.

More later.

Mark-O
