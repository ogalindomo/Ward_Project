Ken and Jeff:

As you know, last year Enron produced its first ever EHS annual report with 
some mentions of our new Corporate Responsibility program.  We are producing 
this year's version, which is expanded both in the environmental reporting as 
well as our human rights and social initiatives covered.  Mike Terraso and I 
would like to include an opening letter by the two of you (last year Ken 
signed it).  Will you please review the attached and edit, comment or approve 
by next week?  We appreciate your help with this.
