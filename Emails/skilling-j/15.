Howdy,

Its me again.  Sorry about filling up your boxs with this "personal" junk
mail.

My tenant, who was excellent, is moving out at end of September, so will be
spending some of my time in SF looking for someone new.  Any leads?  Most of
you know its details; its expensive but competatively priced.

Mark-O
