Subject: Bike for sale

Amelia-
I am selling the bike I rode in the MS150.  I bought to ride in the MS, so it 
has very little miles on it.  It is a Trek 420 with all the ammenities needed 
on a bike.  I have a speedometer, air pump, gel seat, and a water bottle 
holder.  I'm asking for $500 obo.    Can you please forward this message to 
the club members?  

Thanks,
Petual
