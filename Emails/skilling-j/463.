Jeff,

Congratulations are your appointment to Chief Executive Officer of Enron.  A 
well deserved appointment and one that will keep Enron on its incredible 
performance path.   I look forward to expeditiously resolving the issues we 
have at Azurix without tarnishing the image or performance  you have worked 
so diligently to create at Enron.

Good luck and God Speed.
