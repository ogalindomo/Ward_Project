Fred,  I now have a scanner that works (actually the scannner has always
worked).  It's ME that doesn't know how to use the scanner but here's a
shot
at it.  This picture was taken at dinner the night before the SMU/KU game
last month in Big D.

Send it out if you get it OK!!

Chuck

Betas,
I heard back from Mike Arends.  He was out of town on a business/vacation
trip.  He said he is leaning 60/40 to attend homecoming.  He is getting
married on Nov. 11, but his fiancee is supportive of the trip.  (I wonder
how long that kind of cooperation will last?)
Anyway....if you want to give him a call, his number at work is:  800
