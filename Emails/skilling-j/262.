Beta Bros.,
?
Add two more names to the list of confirmed attendees:? Jim 'Pledge  Trainer' 
Glass will be arriving Friday night with his wife and daughter.?  Mitch 
Baddour and his wife, our little sister if memory serves me correctly,  will 
join us too.
?
Clay Coburn will be on the left coast prior to HC weekend and assures me  
that he is working very hard to arrange an alternative circuitous return 
route  to Kansas City that includes BIG D.? I trust that it is only a matter 
of  time before his name will be added to the growing list as well.
