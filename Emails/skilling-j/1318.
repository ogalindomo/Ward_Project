Subject: re: Pre-Interview Questions for Candidates


Troy said questions are OK.  Here are three suggestions from Troy:

1. Please explain briefly the type of government (i.e. City Manager,
Mayor, Council, Fire Commissioner) or other system that you had served
with as a fire officer in the past 10 years.

2. State whether the fire department has any employee group, association
or union that is recognized as the bargaining agent for the department.
If so, please describe your working relationship with that organization.

3. Does the department where you presently work have any type of state or
local civil service?  If so, explain.
