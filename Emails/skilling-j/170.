Subject:  Remarks from Sawhill Memorial Service


Les,

We had a Memorial Service for Nature Conservancy staff and board last week
in
conjunction with our board meeting.  I had the opportunity to say some
words
about John.  I thought you might be interested in seeing them.

Keep in touch,

Mike Coda
