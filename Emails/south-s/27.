Colorado Interstate Gas is holding an open season through May 31 to evaluate
whether it should add capacity from the Rockies to Nevada and northern
California markets.

The project, called the Ruby Pipeline, would total up to 750 million cfd of
incremental capacity and would begin service in late 2003. Bid sheets can be
obtained from CIG's Web site at www.cigco.com/business/colorado/index.html.

CIG said gas production from the Rocky Mountain supply basins "is projected
to increase dramatically over the next few years and the Ruby Pipeline
Project will provide access to these supplies." The Ruby project will
consist of approximately 850 miles of 30- inch and 36-inch pipeline running
from western Wyoming through Utah to Elko, Nev., to points of delivery near
Reno, Nev., Yuba City, Calif., and Sacramento, Calif.

CIG said it anticipates interconnecting with the northern California gas
storage facility of Wild Goose Storage, which is currently holding its own
open season to evaluate expanding its facility.

Ruby is considered the second phase of a project involving CIG and Questar.
The first phase, which entails an agreement between Questar and CIG,
involves Questar developing a 74-mile looping project in Utah. Questar plans
to sell 50% of the ownership interest in the phase I project to a CIG
affiliate, CIG Gas Supply, on the day the phase I facilities go online. CIG
Supply will then lease its 50% interest in the project back to Questar under
a 33-year lease, which would give Questar full operational rights.
