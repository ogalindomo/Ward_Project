Thoughts for the day:
?
We believe the May NatGas contract could come under significant selling 
pressure later in the  day, pehaps trading into the 470-480 range.? Assuming 
May drags June down  with it into the high 480's or low 490's, aggressive 
traders could consider  buying June for the next couple of days looking for a 
pop.? Short-term,  risking a few pennies.
