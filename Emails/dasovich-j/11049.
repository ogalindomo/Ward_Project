Here are the arguments / material that I am trying to round up by mid-day 
Friday.  Please add anything else to this to prove our point.

Enron's Agenda - Making the System More Reliable / Ending the Crisis 

1. Supply - really four key pieces to the puzzle (1) Streamline Generation 
Interconnection, (2) Mandatory Electricity Reliability Organization, (3) 
Public Power Transmission Facilities Fully Under FERC, (4) Complete Open 
Access - End the Native Load Exception

 The key theme:  Open Access "expands" the available generation and reduces 
the overall need to build.

2. Demand - Industrial & Commercial Demand Buydown

 The key theme:  Sometimes the cheapest watt is the watt that isn't used.

I want to add that I still think that the right message is reliability AND 
cost savings.  In California, the electricity bill could go from $7 
billion/year (1999) to $70 billion/year (2001).   No matter how big your 
economy is, there is no way that a price shock of that magnitude won't kill 
your future growth.

KEY PROOF

1. HEPG Presentation    Shapiro

2. Natural Gas Analysis   Carson

3. Balkanization Analysis   Walton/Comnes/Neustaedter

4. AEP Transmission Abuses  Novosel

5. FERC Staff Report Anecdotes  Novosel

6. TCA Analysis - Price Impact  Pickel/Tabors

7. TCA Analysis - Expanding Supply Pickel/Tabors

8. Western Power Market Abuses  Dasovich/Comnes

I will try and call everyone in the am to discuss.

Jim
