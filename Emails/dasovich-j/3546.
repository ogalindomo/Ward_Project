Here are all the pieces of the budget.  There are three sheets.  The first 
two correspond to the separate categories that Rick used at the budget 
meeting in Houston last Friday.  The third is our discretionary budget -- or 
RCR-related -- dollars.  I've included the estimate of existing RCRs that 
will run over and the potential new ones.  Most of our work is now being done 
in coalitions. 

ARM has decided to cut down on the monies spent at the CPUC and instead to 
put it into PR and lobbying.  This budget felects the switch -- with smaller 
dollars anticipated for the CPUC and a retainer requested for ARM's PR and 
lobbying firms.
