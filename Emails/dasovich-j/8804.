Harry raises some good points.  

I am attaching another copy of my comments from this morning--It looks like 
this draft came out before you got these comments.  

I will be traveling without access to my e-mail from 11-4 PST.  Please call 
on my cell phone 713 302 9089 if you have questions.  MDS

Subject: Re: Direct Access  

Initial comments for discussion:  

Fees (exit, entry):  should be transparent - in absolute terms and formula 
that will be used.  Can notional numbers be posted daily?

One-way tolling:  eliminate re-entry fees.  Puts new and returning customers 
on equal footing and eliminates additional admin burdens.

DWR stranded costs for exit fee:  should be an affirmative obligation on 
their part to mitigate any incremental costs (reselling, etc.)

KW threshold:  we're ok with 100 kw (or lower).

Limit on switching: once a year is reasonable.

Areas to clarify:
DWR carve-out:  if load departs (re-enters) DWR, does it simultaneously 
depart (re-enter) the utility? Assuming a clean break from bundled service, 
is there an exit fee from the utility portion of the bundle?

Closure:  need to specify when exit/re-entry fees no longer apply. 

Open Subscription Period:  if DWR does only 5+ year contracts, does this mean 
there will be no open periods for a long time?
