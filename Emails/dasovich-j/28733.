Yesterday the PUC defeated (3-2) on a party line vote the proposed decision 
of Commissioner Bilas re interim policy on standby charges.? Instead, the 
Commission approved Commissioner Wood's alternate, which several parties 
(State Consumers, ORA, New Energy, Capstone, et al) had protested.? My 
understanding is that Commr. Wood's alternate was approved with no changes.? 
It agreed with utilities that standby charges should not reflect diversity 
benefits of DG in distribution because none currently exist.

This decision may have negative implications for the sharing of grid benefits 
of DG with end use consumers and other distributed generators who may provide 
them.

Best, 

Jay Morse, ORA
