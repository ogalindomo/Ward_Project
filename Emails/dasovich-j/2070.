Subject: Protest to ISO Proposal for Price Caps


The attached must be filed on Thrusday (10/5) so please give me your comments 
as soon as possible in the morning.

As you will see, the first argument was lifted heavily from our answer to the 
EOB's complaint for price caps.  The second argument (the monopsonist 
argument) is new (although we have suggested this in earlier pleadings), so 
it may still be a little rough.

Sue: Since EES was in on our earlier protests to price caps, I assumed that 
it would be on this one too.
