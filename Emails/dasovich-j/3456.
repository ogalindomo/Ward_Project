Kevin,

Pursuant to your request for a term sheet that would propose legislation to 
enable broadband access for every home and business in an attempt to bridge 
the digital divide, please see the attached document below.  The term sheet 
incorporates several federal solutions to funding a fiber or DSL build-out 
that will support high speed connectivity for residential and business 
premises, including a "take-back" of HDTV spectrum and subsequent auction 
thereof, as well as the establishment of individual tax credits or a 
"Broadband Buildout and Internet Access Trust Fund."

While the term sheet describes different opportunities for the government to 
endorse the build-out of last mile infrastructure, the federal solutions set 
forth do not have a high probability of enactment by the next congress.  
Thus, we are identifying additional means of promoting broadband access 
through state and municipal governments, as well as private initiatives.  We 
will forward a supplemental document to you in the coming weeks that 
describes additional avenues.  Perhaps we could meet at that time to discuss 
the full array of options.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts or comments.

Regards,

Lara
