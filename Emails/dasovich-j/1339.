John,

I can't answer your questions with any degree of confidence.  I don't know if 
it has ever been done, but I don't know of any prohibitions.  For example,
many essential emergency facilities such as hospitals have back-up 
generation.  The only difference in this case is that there would still be 
energy
delivered from the grid.  However, this type of physical interconnection is 
accommodated for Standby customers.

Additionally, there currently is an open distributed generation proceeding in 
California.  You can contact Harry Kingerski on the status of that proceeding.

With respect to your question about the EPA, that seems more like a 
siting/environmental issue which is way beyond my expertise.  You can try 
calling
Jeff Dasovich.  He will be able to put you in contact with other projects and 
people who may have had to address similar issues.

In the meantime, you can access SCE's I-6 Tariff and Rules through

Subject: I-6

Roger,  We are working with a customer in California (Starwood) who we have a 
longer term deal with.   Some of their Hotels are on I-6 rider. 

The customer is on I-6 and are considering installation of diesel generation 
to run when called for curtailment under I-6.   Can they run the DG or is 
this not allowed under California rules?

I believe that if a customer elects to be on I-6,  the customer cannot claim 
that an emergency condition exist that allows them the use of the DG when 
curtailed under I-6.  In some states the EPA allows DG use in price or 
emergency times.   Or in California will the EPA allow specific under their 
rules?
