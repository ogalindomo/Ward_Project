Ratemaking has gotten no easier.  Maybe we can get the Government to realize 
that they can't even set rates for the little bit of retained generation 
without huge litigation?

		 Subject: UDC Advice Letter Filings on Retained Generation


Attached are some bulletpoint highlights on each of the three UDCs' advice
letter filings made on March 2, 2001 pertaining to cost of service
ratemaking for their retained generation.  Protests on the advice letter are
due on March 22nd.  I do not have e-mail versions of the filings, but will
fax copies to anyone who wants it.
