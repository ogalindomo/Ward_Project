Lisa,
As per your request, here is the email requesting information on the 
California Air Resources Board and its ability to influence pipeline 
specifications for gas quality.

We are requesting this information as we are considering supplying LNG into 
California and will need to fully understand published pipeline quality 
specifications and how these could change. We recently received quality specs 
from SoCal Gas which indicated various allowable percentages of ethane, 
hydrocarbons, etc. and then stated "If a higher figure is approved by the 
California Air Resources Board for the maximum allowable percentage of 
non-methane components, ethane, C3+, and/or C6+ in its Commercial 
Specifications for Compressed Natural Gas, for gas to be supplied s vehicle 
fuel in California, then Utility will so notify Producer, and such higher 
percentage will become the applicable maximum concentration under this 
Agreement;"

Please feel free to contact me with further questions.
Thanks,
