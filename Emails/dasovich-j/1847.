Jeff,

I received the good news yesterday that Edison (SCE) will be a sponsor of
our conference at the $5000 level. I know that you (and of course GSPP) want
Enron to be a sponsor as well. I am trying to help you make this a reality,
and to firm up commitments so that we can publicize them starting with our
first mailing scheduled for next week. By the way, Laura Tyson has given
preliminary acceptance to moderate our first panel.

Following this message, I am sending you a second message that you could
circulate to any others in your company that you wish. It describes two
levels of sponsorship. I wanted to be sure that you know of the options that
we are offering to all of our potential sponsors. I am expecting not only
SCE and Columbia Energy but PG&E and Reliance Energy to become sponsors (we
have a great alum at Reliance, Glen Sweetnam). One or more of them may well
go for the Major Sponsorship, which of course will be especially recognized.
Ticket purchases can count toward sponsorships as indicated. We would be
pleased to count the market value of in-kind streaming video services toward
sponsorship (which I understand is something like $1500).

Would you like me to contact Tim Belden about this? Anything else I can do?

Thanks for all of your help with this Jeff. It's going to be a great event
for the School.

Best,
Lee
