I had a conversation yesterday with Brian Fitzgerald, local counsel in CT, 
regarding the LighTrade issue.  He informed me that LighTrade has been 
successful thus far in its argument that it should not be regulated by the 
DPUC due to its intent:  LighTrade does not intend to provide the actual 
bandwidth to customers.  Instead, it wants to establish connections between 
various points as a service to those companies that sell bandwidth.  Brian 
has offered to monitor this issue for us.  I told him that we would let him 
know if we wanted him to do that.

Additionally, please use this link to access the LighTrade petition and other 
documents that are posted on the DPUC's website.  If you have difficulty with 
this link, please let me know.

I wanted to pass this along in the event you might find this useful.

Thanks.
