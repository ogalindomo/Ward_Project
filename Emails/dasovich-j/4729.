Steve:?? Burney Forest Power has been running flat  out since June, 
delivering close to 100% of our capacity every hour, less an  eight day 
maintenance outage.? Unfortunately, we will be reducing our  generation next 
month due to a shortage of fuel caused by the USFS locking out  some of our 
suppliers from Sierra Nevada national forest lands because of a  threat from 
an environmental organization's lawsuit.? This action,  effective as of 
December 11th by the USFS, could affect some 10 to 14 biomass  facilities in 
varying degrees.?? 
?
It would appear to me that Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis,  and Secretary 
Richardson would take steps to help alleviate this situation if  the best 
interests of electric energy users were considered.??

Subject: URGENT: REQUEST  TO PRODUCE AS MUCH POWER AS POSSIBLE


California Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis,  Secretary of Energy 
Richardson, and FERC Commissioner Hoecker held a joint  press conference 
related to the California energy problem.? They  indicated a critical need 
for supply TODAY to serve the California  marketplace.? Secretary Richardson 
indicated he will exercise his  emergency power under the Federal Power Act 
[section 202(c)] to direct  generation to California.? The Secretary 
indicated that DOE, under the  FPA, will set a fair price for the power.
?
IEP requests all its members to deliver  as much generation as possible to 
California ASAP in order to avert  potential shortages.? 
?
In addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein  called for regionwide price 
caps and mandatory, reasonable long-term  contracts between generators and 
the utilities.? They made the point  that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being 
exported from the state, currently a lack  of adequate planning and 
scheduling of resources/planned outages exists, and  indicated that the CPUC 
would moved to implement forward contracting.?  
?
IEP will forward the formal statement from the  Press Conference (or a 
summary) as soon as  available.
