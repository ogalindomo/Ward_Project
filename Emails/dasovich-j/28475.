I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if 
Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition 
of Spot Market
Service which says "and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical 
corporation to
provide retail electric service" which seems to me to go way beyond even 
energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S 
twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market 
service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best 
efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara
