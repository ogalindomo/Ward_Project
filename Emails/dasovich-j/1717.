Gas ESPs and CPAG members:

For our meeting on Thursday, part of our agenda is a detailed review of the
new gas ESP storage unbundling, and consolidated billing credits.  Here is
an electronic version of explanatory material that was mailed to gas ESPs
early last week to prepare them for these new provisions of core gas
aggregation service.

 <<Open Season for Storage.doc>>

This storage unbundling will be the subject of an October through November
open season, with implementation in December.

 <<Billing Credits.doc>>
These billing credits will be available in October.

You may wish to review these documents and generate questions for our
meeting in San Francisco.  If you have questions in the meantime, please
call.
