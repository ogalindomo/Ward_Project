Hey buddy-

Great to hear from you!  Hope you are enjoying life in SF and Berkeley and
hope all is going well for you.  I just love this place - I wish you were
here to share in my fun.

So, when is the big Haas field-trip to NYC???

Hey darlin'.  How are you?  Bet NYC is mighty nice this time of year.  Hope
to get there real soon.

Best to you and your better half,
