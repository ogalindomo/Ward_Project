IEP is continueing to cover the various CPUC/FERC/Fed Hearings in San Diego
related to the California marketplace.  We are doing this under the auspices
of the Market Response Project.  Below is a brief summary from Doug Kerner
regarding the series of San Diego Hearings last week.

IEP also is preparing draft comments in response to CPUC Commissioner Wood's
OII on Market Structure.  This will be circulated for your review and
comment in the very near future.

California
