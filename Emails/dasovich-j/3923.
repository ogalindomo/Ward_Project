My apologies, Linda.  Sometimes it pays to see what name pops up from the 
Enron address book before hitting the send button.  And thanks, Rick.  I'll 
note the two r's in Rrobertson.

Best,
Jeff

Rrobertson, not Roberts- maybe... Linda Roberts has some stroke w/ Diane 
Feinstein!

Subject: Ms Feintsein and California

Greetings Linda:

Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  

Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator 
Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a 
meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it 
will go, but wanted to pass it along.

Best,
Jeff
