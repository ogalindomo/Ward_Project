Energy Committee Members:
There will be a Public Participation Hearing before the CPUC on Friday, May
11 in San Jose.  The hearing will take place at 3pm at the Double Tree Hotel
at 2050 Gateway Place.  This will be an excellent forum for the business
community to express their concerns about the rate increase.  To participate
you must arrive early and sign-in to speak.  A member of the Public
Advisor's Office will be there for assistance.  To get more advice about
participation at the hearing contact the CPUC's Public Advisory Office.  I
will provide more information once I receive it.  Laura
