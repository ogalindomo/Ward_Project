Jeff:

To follow up on my voice mail message, I would like your feedback as I 
develop a message around the DWR stranded costs.  

Alan, Ban and I have been in touch with the EGM fundamentals and Utility Risk 
Management groups to build upon their financial/technical analysis of the 
contracts.  I have also had some limited feedback from Michael Tribolet on 
credit issues in the contracts.

Chris Calger just came by (I am in the Portland office today) to say that he 
wants to make sure that he is part of the discussion concerning our message 
on these stranded costs (apparently there are some commercial sensitivities - 
for example, a current deal with Allegheny). 

Some areas for input:
* Who is our audience (CA state or federal)?
*What is our message, e.g., contracts will impede DA; DWR has overcommitted, 
etc.?
*What form should our message take (presentation, memo, one-pager)? 

Attached is a presentation I started.

Thanks,

Jennifer
