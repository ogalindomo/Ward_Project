Hi,

I found your names in the evening MBA directory of the Haas web site.
Please ignore this message if you are not interested in being a key
founding player in an early stage startup.

I have a compelling business idea, have built a web site
http://www.jiss.com/, and have good management background in
software/web development.  I am looking for key members to form
a strong founding team to help secure funding and build the business.

If you have management experience in the functions of business
development, or sales and marketing particularly in the software or
consulting industry, and is convinced of the idea presented in my
web site, please contact me.

thanks,
Dowson
