Jeanne - I think you have all the relevant issues. On allocation, we said in 
initial comments we favor an equal 3 cents increase to all classes.  Can we 
tweak this to say now, what we don't want is a reallocation based on 
perceived rate inequities, and any of the other methods are acceptable (3 
cents, top 100 hours, 99px load weighted costs, equal % of gen costs) but 
after seeing all the testimony we think equal % of gen costs is preferable.  
If asked, that's what I will say.

Some of the other outline points will really require "new" testimony, so 
we'll have to talk about that.

		 Subject: Outline of Brief for Rate Design Proceeding


Attached is an proposed outline of the Brief we will file next week in the
Rate Design Case.  As you will see, the outline is more in the way of
putting out thoughts and highlighting where we need to reach some closure on
certain items as well as where I need some more input from you.  I would
like feed back on this by the end of the day Friday, as I plan to spend some
time on the brief this weekend. Perhaps we could spend some time talking
about it on either Thursday or Friday mornings' call.
