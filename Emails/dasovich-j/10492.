Rep Barton (R, TX) is circulating a list of measures to address the energy 
emergency.  This list may become part of a bill (i.e, not yet law, not even 
yet a bill) On the list is the concept  "ensure appropriate wholesale prices 
without discouraging markets."  FERC would be authorized to issue a Section 
206 proceeding to investigate unjust, unreasonable rates. Basically this 
would perpetuate the refund cloud the market is currently under but stops 
short of price caps, which appears to be Burton's intention.
