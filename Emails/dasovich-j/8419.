I have reserved conference room EB 4325 for the next 3 TAR&L meetings (1/25, 
2/1 & 2/8).  The meeting will run from 8:30 to 11:30 and a light breakfast 
will be served.

The dial in number for these next 3 meetings is as follows:

International Participants: 1-805-240-9463, passcode 449834
Domestic Participants:  1-888-232-3866. passcode 449834

Host (Wayne):   1-888-232-3866, passcode 860073 (host only)

There are a total of seven ports and automatic port expansion should 
additional parties wish to join in.  All that is necessary is to dial the 
appropriate number above.  

Should you have any questions, or need additional assistance, please do not 
hesitate to contact me at 713-853-7097.

Thanks!
