This advice letter filing submits a replacement to the utility=01,s existin=
g=20
Rule 21, dealing with interconnection standards for non-utility-owned=20
generation.  This replacement is supposedly made in accordance with the=20
Commission=01,s direction in D.00-11-001, the first decision in the distrib=
uted=20
generation proceeding, which directed the utilities to adopt a model=20
interconnection tariff which was contained in that decision.

If Enron is interested in distributed generation, then it may want to revie=
w=20
this tariff and become familiar with its terms.  FYI.  Please advise if you=

would like additional information.
