Alan,

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?
