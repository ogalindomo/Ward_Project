I have been trying to locate the right person in the organization to assist 
with some questions about   Socal Gas.  

Comment/Question:  Tricon, an EES gas customer behind Socal, paid 
significantly  more for marketer gas service (IF SOCAL BORDER)   in Q4 00' 
when compared to the cost of gas for Socal Gas customers.  How does Socal Gas 
adjust for its cost of gas?  Is there a delayed true-up mechanism???  What 
options are available should the customer return to utility service?

Tricon has been asking for the information for over a week.  I need an update 
as soon as possible.

I appreciate your help.  Call me at X35976 if you have any questions,

Michelle
