We would need to protest, but of course strategically.  Can we discuss
anything that goes out?

Subject:  PG&E A/L Setting Interim Value for Hydro

The phoenix keeps rising.  PG&E has submitted a new advice letter seeking
to establish an interim valuation for its remaining hydro assets at $2.8
billion effective June 23,00.

We have 20 days from October 26 to protest.  I would assume we will want to
protest, unless I hear differently.

Thanks.
