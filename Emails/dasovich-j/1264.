Below is a memo summarizing the EOB filing at FERC petitioning for the
application of price caps due to the dysfunctional market.  The memo also
summarizes the CALPX filing to implement its own price caps.  Comments on
the EOB filing are due Sept. 18.  Comments on the CALPX filing are due Sept.
12.

Some IEP members have indicated informally to me that that would like to
support IEP's intervention in these matters, particularly the EOB filing.
However, I have no written/email responses to the IEP
Restructuring/Transmission soliciation (or indeed, the email we sent out
last week alerting you to these filings) which would provide the resources
to engage counsel to draft an IEP response.

For IEP to respond to these pleadings, particularly the EOB pleading which
probably is the best target, then we need commitments to fund that effort.
Our latest Restructuring/Transmission Special Fund solicitation sought
$5,000-$10,000 per company to fund filings like these, as well as cover past
Accounts/Payable.  Only a few companies have responded.

Accordingly, IEP would appreciate an indication from the companies as to
whether they would support IEP's intervention in the EOB petition and to
what level ($).  I suspect that this intervention, which may require some
technical analysis from MRW as to operating costs in California, may cost
$5,000-$10,000.

If you are interested in IEP engaging in this matter, please let me know by
COB Monday the extent to which you would fund this effort.  This will allow
me sufficient time to inform the membership whether or not IEP will engage,
thus allowing individual companies sufficient time to develop their own
pleading if they so desire.  If IEP engages, we would circulate draft IEP
comments by Thursday, schedule a conference call for Friday, Sept. 15, and
file the document on Sept. 18
