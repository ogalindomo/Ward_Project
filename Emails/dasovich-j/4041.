The following is a statement for use in response to the lawsuit filed in San 
Diego today:

"This is a publicity stunt.  Three separate federal and state regulatory 
agencies have investigated the allegations rehashed in this lawsuit and found 
that no market power was exercised in California.  This lawsuit is completely 
without merit and is yet another attempt to fix blame rather than fix the 
problem in California.

California needs a strong forward market so utilities can hedge out the 
volatility in the spot power market and California needs incentives for 
companies to build adequate generation in the state."
