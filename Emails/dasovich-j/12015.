Hi All!

I was hoping to get some support and suggestions for putting together a baby 
shower for Catherine.
Her due date is early June, which doesn't leave much planning time.  I was 
thinking about purchasing
3-4 gifts from the entire office.  If you have suggestions, ideas, or want to 
make a contribution toward the gifts
please let me know ASAP. I will get back to everyone once I can secure a time 
and date.

Thanks,
April Hrach
