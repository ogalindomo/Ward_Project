The "Enron" list serve is now up and running.  To send a message to the
group, just put enron@lists.qgadc.com in the To: line and it will be sent to
the entire group.  The following is the current distribution list.  I have
asked that Karl Gallant, Terry Allen, and Governor Raciot be added.  Is
there anyone else who should be on the list?
