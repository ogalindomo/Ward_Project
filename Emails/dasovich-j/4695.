WPTF will be submitting a ton of data to the AG office tomorrow.  It consists 
of all WPTF-related data -- no member-specific data.  It includes a password 
to the WPTF web site so that the guy can read all the regulatory filings 
we've made -- and the burritos (weekly newsletters to the membership).  Also 
they are submitting all meeting minutes, Gary's day planner and the bylaws.  
This seems fine.
