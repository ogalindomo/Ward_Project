Colleen and I have been trying to figure out a date for dinner and I thought
it might be nice if we all had dinner together at our house next week
(Colleen and I will cook - don't be scared).  We figured out Thursday works
for us both, so I hope it works for all of you.  Scotty, I realize you might
not be at home until 8:30 or so, but that's ok.

OK??
