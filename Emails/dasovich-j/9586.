In my opinion, end game here is a CYA for SoCal to at least "appear" to be 
concerned, and a means to collectively gang-up on the CPUC to give the LDC's 
cost recovery mechanisms for any needed investments.

Thanks.  My guess is that someone ought to go and represent TW.  Fawcett and 
Harris ought to make that call.  Jeff D:  I assume you know who Lad Lorenz 
is.  Either Jeff:  does Lad's involvement signal anything to us--i.e., is he 
their "get stuff done guy" or their "try to look like you are getting stuff 
done guy" ?  DF
