As EBS moves further into 2001, we would like to take some time to reinforce 
our strategy and establish common goals for the year.  We have scheduled the 
following all-employee meetings for EBS' various locations:


HOUSTON & PLEASANTON (via video conference)  Wednesday, February 14  Hyatt 
Regency - Imperial Ballroom 
        3:00-4:30pm (CST)

PORTLAND       Thursday, March 8   Marriott Hotel - Salon E
        1:30-3:00pm (PST)


The date for a meeting in London is currently being finalized.  Pleasanton 
employees will again be linked into the Houston meeting via video conference. 

At each of the meetings, we will share a portion of the EBS analyst 
presentation.  We'll also take time to answer your questions.  If you wish to 
submit questions in advance, please send them via e-mail to Jessica Nevin.

Refreshments will be provided at each of the meetings.
