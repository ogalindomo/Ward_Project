NOTE FROM LUISCARLOS:

Christine,

I'd like to extend another invitation to those Haas Students that are
interested. On Dec. 6th, we're having a "live taping" of two startup-focused
presentations, one by the Founder of Real Communities, and an expert on
virtual communities, Cynthia Typaldos.  Our other speaker is the founding
General Partner of Blueprint Ventures, located in San Francisco.  It is a
good opportunity for Haas students to hear expert views and have a chance to
meet them as well.  Simply have students RSVP directly to me.  The first ten
to respond will be assured a seat (no registration fee).

Best Regards,
Luiscarlos
