Thanks.  Was aware of the power/gas split, but FYI, Chris Foster on the 
Portland desk is a great source of information--Midmarket electricity trader 
and a very straightforward guy.

Apparently their credit limit has not been reached.  They haven't been doing 
any deals, but because PG&E hasn't been online.  I didn't realize that the 
Portland office only does power sales.  Gas desk is in Houston.  I'll let you 
know if I find out anything more.

Thanks.  I was literally just about to call the Portland desk.  You saved me 
the trouble.  Did they say whether they have any plans to cut PG&E off (from 
gas sales) in the near future?

FYI, Mark just walked down to the trading floor, and we have not stopped 
selling to PG&E.  Apparently, the ISO put out another list and we're on it. kd
