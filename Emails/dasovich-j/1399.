Attn: Faculty and Students,

Izio has advised us there is an incompatibility with Infopier Courseware Web
Management System and Internet Explorer 5.5.  Izio's developers are  fixing
this problem in future releases of the software.  In the meantime here is a
work around Izio has suggested.

Symptoms:

Students have reported trouble downloading handouts especially Word and
Excel files from course web sites.  The students are reporting getting a
blank screen when they try to access web pages where handouts have been
posted.

Work around:

Instead of just clicking with the left mouse button as usual, click with the
RIGHT mouse button, and ask to save the document on your hard drive. You'll
then need to load it from your hard drive into Excel.
