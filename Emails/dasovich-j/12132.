Hello all.

Well, remember Stephen King and his book that was published only on the
web?  The site later went down, because people couldn't handle the honor
system.  (Pay as you read.)

So, we're working on something like that for our Evening News.  The latest
issue of the Evening News is on the web at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/EvMBA/ .  Just click on Evening MBA News in
the "Evening MBA News" section on the right.

Unlike the other web site, we're not requiring any type of payment.  It's
yours free of charge.  Feel free to print, make copies, and distribute it,
as you like.  No need to worry about paying royalties or copyright
infringements.  Isn't it grand?
