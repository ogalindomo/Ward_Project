To All,

For security purposes, the custodial crew has been asked to lock classroom
doors nightly at 10:00 p.m.  They have been directed as follows:

If students are in a classroom when a custodian comes to lock the doors at
10:00 p.m., the students may remain in the room, but the door will be
locked.  If students leave the room after 10:00 p.m., they will not be able
to re-enter.

As previously agreed:  1) Students will be asked to, and are expected to,
leave a classroom when a custodian comes - at any time - to clean the room;
2) Students may remain in the building until midnight; and 3) If students
are asked to leave the building after midnight by a member of the custodial
crew or the Security Guard, they should do so.

Security is important to all of us.  Your cooperation will be
appreciated.  Thank you.
