Hi everyone,

I just wanted to let you know that our new baby has arrived.

Michael Ryan Courtney was born Sun Sep 17 at 12:42 pm
and weighed 7 lbs 10 oz. Just to make life interesting, we
moved into our new house the following day, Mon Sep 18.
So Mom left for the hospital from the old house and came
home to a new one.

Everyone is doing fine. Hope to see you all soon.

Katy Jenkins
