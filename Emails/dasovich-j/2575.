Confidential Settlement Document Under CPUC Rule 51

PARTIES:

This is a reminder that we have a Gas Accord II Settlement Workshop next
week on Wednesday and Thursday, October 25 and 26.  The workshop on
Wednesday will start at 9:30 a.m. and end around 3:30 p.m.  We will provide
lunch this day.  On Thursday, we would like to start at 9:00 a.m. and end
around noon.  The Workshop is at PG&E's headquarters, Conference Room 300,
77 Beale Street, San Francisco.

Please respond, to let us know whether you will attend next week's workshop,
so that we can get a head-count for lunch on Wednesday.   Please RSVP to
Darcy Morrison at D2mr@pge.com, or by telephone at (415) 973-6644.

Attached below is our proposed agenda.  The topics include:  balancing,
transaction information, open-season rules, PG&E core procurement, and core
aggregation.

Also on the Wednesday agenda, we have set aside some time for a feedback
discussion with you.  We are looking for your thoughts on the material we
have presented in the Workshops to-date, topics for our final Workshop on
November 7 and 8, issues you may wish to have addressed at that workshop,
and any process suggestions.

Looking ahead, our initial thinking for the November 7 and 8 Workshop
includes the following topics:
* A more comprehensive supply/demand/pipeline capacity forecast and
the implications on facility needs, including under cold weather conditions.
* Further explanation of the Supply Reliability options discussed at
the September 27 Workshop.
* More detail on the Capital Expenditure forecasts.
* Additional analysis of the Direct Connect to Backbone and Local
Transmission rate design options.
* Continue the feedback discussion.

Please be reminded that we would like everyone involved in the Gas Accord II
Settlement to fill out our information form, including initials indicating
