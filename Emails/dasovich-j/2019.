It's not good.  Davis wants to cut the price caps in half.  He believes you 
need to keep the utilities in good financial shape or there won't be any 
"California-based companies to invest in generation and transmission." And he 
wants "CA companies to determine the destiny of CA consumers".  All this 
sounds pretty bad to me.
