Subject: California Update--07.24.01

The Assembly passed the budget late last night.
The Assembly recessed without passing out any energy bill.
There is some talk of a working group being convened beginning next week 
comprised of Legislative staff and industry to continue to try to work out a 
deal.
For now, however, the free world is safe from the CA Assembly and the 
Senate--they've left and all Legislative activity is on hold until the 20th 
of August, unless leadership, or the Governor tries to bring them back early.
The activity now moves to the PUC.

Best,
Jeff
