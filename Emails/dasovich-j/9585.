Drew, Jeff
I've been out of pocket a couple of days... sorry I didn't get back sooner.  
Yes, TW did know about this meeting.  We got a call from Lad at the beginning 
of the week letting us know it was coming and asking us would we 
participate.  In fact, we've tentatively arranged a follow-on meeting on 
Friday with SoCal to discuss TW-only issues.

Thanks.  My guess is that someone ought to go and represent TW.  Fawcett and 
Harris ought to make that call.  Jeff D:  I assume you know who Lad Lorenz 
is.  Either Jeff:  does Lad's involvement signal anything to us--i.e., is he 
their "get stuff done guy" or their "try to look like you are getting stuff 
done guy" ?  DF
