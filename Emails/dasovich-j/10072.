This is the right document reference.  Just to be sure, I am attaching the 
final version from my directory as well.

Jeff,
Chris asked me to forward to you our CDWR bid from February 6.  Attached is 
what I think is the final version, but I'm asking Dale to confirm to you that 
I've pulled the right version from his system.  Thanks.
