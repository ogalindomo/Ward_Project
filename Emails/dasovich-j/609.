Below is a draft standby tariff that was prepared by Enron and others during 
settlement negotiations in Mass (the tariff was never formally submitted) 
that might be of use as we prepare for California Ph II (and New York).  

Also, I was talking with Sara McKinley of the DPCA and they are not going to 
participate in the Phase II proceeding due to lack of funding.  However, she 
mentioned that CMA, Capstone, New Energy, and Honeywell have jointly hired 
John Nimmons for this phase and that DPCA may endorse their testimony.  She 
also asked if she could get a copy of our testimony to review and perhaps 
endorse.

Tom,  

Here's the Pro-Forma Standby Tariff that we prepared for settlement 
negotiations with Mass Electric in 1998.  

Hope this helps.

Jeff
