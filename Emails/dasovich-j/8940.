PP =01) I know you said that you didn=01,t have reservations for dinner on
Valentine=01,s Day and hopefully you still don=01,t and hopefully you both =
don=01,t
feel strongly about doing something alone on the night of Valentine=01,s Da=
y.
It=01,s Sean=01,s birthday and Molly just told me that no one can ever do a=
nything
on his birthday because they go to dinner and stuff.  We were thinking of
having a small get-together (just us and any good single friends that he
has) on February 14th and making a special dinner just for him (might be a
lot of lentils).  Could you guys do that with us?
