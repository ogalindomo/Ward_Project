Wanda Curry mentioned that SCE was going to have a couple day delay in giving 
us more information about our PX credits because they were working on a 
request from Loretta Lynch to forward details on PX credits to her.  The 
context is probably the SCE/PGE Advice letter filings to change PX credit 
formulas.  Could result in our SCE PX credit exposure ($130 Million) soon 
becoming public through some CPUC document .
