This is the final session for review sessions.  The Haas review will be
held from 9-12 Saturday morning in the Anderson auditorium.  The Peninsula
review will be held from 3-6 at Geron as per Pamela Smith's e-mails.  The
format will be as follows.  For the first hour and a half I will review
the course material. The following time will be spent answering questions.
Questions on the most difficult problems from the problem sets should be
asked at a different time so as to maximize class welfare.  Once again,
you should determine areas of confusion some time this week so we can deal
with them with sufficient time.   I am willing to provide plenty of help
this week, whether in person or over email.  Just to warn you, I will not
be spending Sunday at my computer answering emails.  Therefore catch me
while I am stuck at my computer, namely all this week.  I hope you all are
well, and will see you either tuesday or saturday.  One more thing.  We
will be passing out GSI evaluations today and tomorrow. Please take these
seriously.  Your suggestions are extremely useful to me.  The results of
these evaluations do matter.  Thanks for taking the time to do these.
