To:  All PX Participants

On Friday, December 15, 2000, the CalPX will be conducting an upgrade of the
CalPX Network in Alhambra.  The work is scheduled to begin at 21:00 (12/15/00)
and run through 02:00 (12/16/00).

During the upgrade, all network connections will be shut down; thus the CalPX 
is
requesting participants to submit the following schedules in advance by 21:00
(12/15/00):

1.   Supplemental energy bids for hours-ending 23:00 (12/15/00) through 05:00
(12/16/00)
2.   Day-of Adjustment and Ancillary Services for hours-ending 01:00 
(12/16/00)
through 06:00 (12/16/00)

Due to the nature of the upgrade, Day-Of Finals will not be communicated to
participants via the PXTA, but through electronic mail.  The same electronic
mail address submitted to the CalPX for Daylight Saving earlier this year will
be used.

A test electronic mail will be sent to that address for verification on
Thursday, December 14, 2000.  If you do not receive or choose to use a 
different
electronic mail address, please contact the Trade Floor at 800-464-8831.

The Real Time Operations should not be affected by this outage, and can be
reached at the regular number during the upgrade at (626) 537-3232.
