Hi Evening MBA students:

We're posting the Spring 2001 course descriptions to the web on Thursday
and Friday.

Until then, I've attached course descriptions for:
E210 Competitive Strategy (Tiffany)
E259-1 Management.Com (Griffith)
E 268 Sales Management (Cain)

You may want to look at course descriptions for the other spring courses by
looking at Spring 2000 and Spring 1999 descriptions to get an idea of the
course itself.

Spring 2001 course descriptions are at the front desk too, if you come by.

Thanks and see you,
TJ
