Hello Steven,
It was a pleasure talking to you this morning. I am following up with an
attachment that you could pass on to your clients. The agenda for hte
conference is being developed and I will send you the brochure copy as soon
as it is done. This attachment will help folks to mark their calendars and
may be register prior to the cutoff date to avail the lower registration
fee.

Thanks, please call me if you have any questions.
Jairam.
