conference call schedule.  Since PJM made its RTO filing on October 11th, and 
RTO West has made public its intent to file its substantive RTO proposal one 
week after the October 16th deadline, we will discuss the PJM filing on 
Friday in place of RTO West.  We will schedule a call on RTO West and any 
other significant filings that may be made for Friday, October 27th.  A 
schedule for those calls will follow.
