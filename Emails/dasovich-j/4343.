No invite here.

I thought Gray was too old for birthdays!

Maybe IEP should give him a nice big candle to light the cake.

Julee, Williams received a faxed invitation to the Governor's
Birthday party at Haim Saben's house about a week and a half ago.  Do you
know if any other generators or marketers in IEP received the invite?  Who
in IEP would know?
