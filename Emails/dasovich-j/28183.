Subject: Core/Non-Core Analysis

Per our discussion, the updates to the core/non-core analysis - this includes 
the payment for the $1.045 pro-rata to PGE, SCE, & SDG&E and then divided 
between core and non-core based upon the 75%/25% 20kW and above break-out.  
Please review and let me know if we need to do any further updates.
