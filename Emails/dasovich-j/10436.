Here are my suggested amendments for AB 21X.  I am off to the oral argument
on the rate orders.  If Scott doesnt hear from Enron internal people or from
Aaron by 2:30, get these amendments to the Direct Access coalition.  Try to
accomodate Enron and Aaron as best you can if there are changes.  Mike Day
