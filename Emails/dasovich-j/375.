Author Sponsored
Summary:
This bill would, for each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2000, 
and before January 1, 2005, allow a one-time refundable personal income tax 
credit, not to exceed $500, in an amount equal to 80% of the cost paid or 
incurred for obtaining a personal computer, printer, and access to the 
Internet, as provided.
This bill would require the commission to establish a class of lifeline 
Internet access service necessary to meet minimum residential Internet needs, 
set rates for that service, develop eligibility criteria, assess the degree 
of achievement of universal Internet access.
The furnishing of lifeline Internet access service is in the public interest 
and should be supported fairly and equitably by every Internet Service 
Provider, and the commission in administering the lifeline Internet access 
service program, should implement the program in an equitable, 
nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral manner for the Internet Service 
Provider industry.
