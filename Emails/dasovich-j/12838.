The Assembly Appropriations Committee, which had  intended to hear AB 2xx 
(Corbett) next Wednesday, will instead hear this bill  this Wednesday, May 23 
at 9:30am.
You should be aware that Corbett is really pushing  the bill (she asked for 
the earlier hearing date) and that she will be holding a  press conference in 
the morning to tout the bill.? There are significant  concerns being 
expressed on the bill by the fiscal committee, but it is likely  to be passed 
out.
Also, the bill will not go to Suspense because it  raises revenue for the 
State.? Therefore, it will be voted upon on  Wednesday.
