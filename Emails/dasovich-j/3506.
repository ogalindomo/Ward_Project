I'll take a wild guess about what will be in the plan.

1. Marshall Law
2. Nationalize the grid.
3. International energy crimes trial.

No rumors from the AB 1890 group either.  Seems like the plan is being 
developed by a select few and very close to the vest.

Subject: Gov. Davis' Dec 1 Plan

The Governor obviously picked Dec 1 so they could review everyone's filings 
from the 22nd.  I've asked our lobbying firm -- governmental Advocates -- to 
see what they can find out about the plan.  I haven't even heard any rumors.
