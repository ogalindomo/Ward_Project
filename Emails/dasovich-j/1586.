I want to use you as a personal reference.  Is that OK?  I need your title
and direct dial number (i think it's 415-782-7822).  Write back soon.

We want to go ahead with the road repair.  Nancy said the cost was about
$900.  However, we want to hold off on doing the stumps.  Nancy doesn't
think we go there often enough to spend the money right now to do that.
Can
anything be done about the culvert that didn't entail too much expense?

I'm having difficulty finding out what the duty is on the wine we
brought in
here.  If you could, without spending a lot of time, find out what it
costs
per liter above the 3 liter amount you can bring into Mexico duty-free.
It
would help us negotiate with the authorities here if we knew what the
amount
should be.
