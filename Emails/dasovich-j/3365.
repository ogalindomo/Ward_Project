Subject: Talking Points for UC Berkeley conference on CA Electricity Mess

Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday.  
If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL:  
http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.

I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?"  I've been asked to 
identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the 
solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).

There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and 
used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The 
other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10 
meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the 
"facilitator."

All comments are appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
