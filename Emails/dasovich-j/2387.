Sounds good to me!

Do you want to try to read the case on our own and meet during the break on
Tuesday to discuss?

Let me know what you think!

Hi Kelly,

What do you think about the idea of getting our group together to talk 
about the finance project soon?  If we wait too long, it will sneak up on
us.

Cheers,
