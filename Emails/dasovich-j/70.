Subject: Update on Electricity Restructuring Legislation

Ginger - please forward to the folks in Rick's group.  Many thanks.


Here's an update on the recent developments on electricity restructuring 
legislation in the House and Senate.  Two legislative mark-up vehicles have 
been unveiled, HR 2944 and a Senate bill sponsored by Senator Murkowski that 
has yet to be formally introduced.  On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, 
the Energy and Power subcommittee held the legislative hearings on 
Congressman Barton's bill, HR 2944.  Betsy Moler testified on behalf of AAE 
and her testimony is attached, along with a one page summary, and a copy of 
our proposed amendment submitted to the subcommittee.  We support the Barton 
bill, if and ONLY if, this amendment is incorporated.  Currently, the outlook 
is very positive that the amendment will be adopted and the legislation will 
move forward for full House consideration.  We need your support to contact 
state advocates in order to get them to support this amendment.

The second piece of electricity legislation was released last Thursday and 
the draft legislative language is attached.

We feel very positive that we can pass electricity legislation this Congress 
(ie. next year).   We see the critical pitfall as subcommittee action, but 
remain confident that enactment is possible.  We will be sure to keep you 
updated on any developments as they occur and appreciate your continued hard 
work in the states to help push federal legislation.

Thanks.
