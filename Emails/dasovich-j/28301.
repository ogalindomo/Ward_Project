PG&E argues that since the Commission has  not completed market valuations=

for PG&E=01,s generating assets,?it  therefore may not legally determine th=
e=20
value of those assets for ratemaking  purposes until such time as those=20

The utility stresses that Section 367(b) of  the PU Code?requires the=20
Commission to market value the utilities=01,  generation assets =01&not lat=

method.

PG&E concludes that effective January 1,  2002, its non-nuclear retained=20
