As discussed on the conference call yesterday, attached is today's copy of 
Bandwidth Market Report.  I realize a few of you have access to this.  Please 
forward comments regarding this publication to me so I can contact the 
publisher and get additional pricing information if more of you are 
interested.  

Thanks.
