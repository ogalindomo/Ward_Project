Folks,

There will be a final Q&A teleconference call between the ISO and market
participants regarding the establishment of a Super Peak Energy
product/matching-service. The teleconference will be on Wednesday,
August 30, at 2 p.m. Pacific time.

The call in number is: 312-470-0030
The passcode is: 58305

Whereas I don't have an agenda for the meeting, I will begin by asking
those of you calling in to pose your question, and everyone will get at
least one shot at it.  Representatives from both the ISO, APX, and the
California PX will be on the call, too.
