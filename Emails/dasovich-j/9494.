Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows 
about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers, Kistler, 
etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number is (707) 
829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but you can 
"double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the winemaker at 
Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric on some 
projects.
