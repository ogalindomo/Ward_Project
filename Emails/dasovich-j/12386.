Greetings Piper:

My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think
you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials
on our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be
forwarding those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work
for you?

Best,
Jeff Dasovich
