Gary,

It was not my intention to have WPTF carry the ball on this effort, but only 
to
alert the members of this proposal. Dynegy will be participating on its own. 
We
hope that others will also particpate.

Subject:  WPTF Involvement in Cal PX Code of Conduct



Folks,

Reliant and Dynegy have asked if WPTF can work with parties to craft a
Cal PX code of conduct for PX market participants.  I have instructed
Dan that he can review documents which need legal attention subject to
the proviso that Dynegy and Reliant will pick up Dan's costs.  If the
Board wishes to motion this item, and hold an e-mail vote, I will be
happy to conduct that, and then solicit other funders.

I await your instructions.  Specific questions about the COC should go
to either Joe Paul at Dynegy, or Curtis at Reliant.
