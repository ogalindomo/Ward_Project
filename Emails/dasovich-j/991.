FYI. All articles that I have sent out regarding the California Power Issue 
and national electric deregulation issues are available on the home.enron.com 
website or at this link 
http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/Public_Affairs/CalDereg.nsf/MainHome?OpenF
rameSet . There are also other electric deregulation news articles and some 
statements from EPSA on this site that I have not sent out. Please feel free 
to check out the site. Currently, we have had close to 2,000 hits on the 
site. A new section has been added to the website called Enron Talking Points 
and Speeches. This site has not been populated, but as soon as there are 
internal documents/speeches/talking points that are available for public 
viewing I will place them on the site. 

Thanks,

Gavin
