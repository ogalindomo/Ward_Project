Sorry, Mike.  Just got this.  Will try to turn it around pronto.  Our guy 
John Neslage is trying to pull together exactly what you're requesting.  
He'll get it to you as soon as we've got it pulled together.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff--can you send me asap  a real quick message listing all of the current 
"X" legislation that is out there that we are following, along with a brief 
description of what each bill is about and whether we support or oppose.  
That will help me keep track of the alphabet soup.  Thanks.  MDS
