Colombia's Medellin Utility Drops Isagen Investment, Papers Say
1/25/1 8:49 (New York)


     Bogota, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Colombia's largest municipal
utility, Empresas Publicas de Medellin, won't seek to buy a stake
in state-run generator Isagen because leftist guerrilla attacks on
the power grid have increased its costs, newspapers said.
     The newly sworn in mayor of Medellin, Luis Perez, told a
Senate hearing that the country's third largest city would instead
seek to invest the estimated $400 million the purchase would have
cost into programs to generate jobs in Medellin, the daily El
Tiempo reported.
     ``There is no sense in crying over spilled milk,'' Mines and
Energy Minister Carlos Caballero was quoted by El Tiempo as saying
upon hearing the news.
     The government last year pushed back until 2001 its plans to
sell the state's 77 percent stake in Isagen due to a series of
lawsuits filed by EPM, as the Medellin utility is called. EPM
alleged it had been discriminated against in the sales process
because of anti-monopoly regulations.
     EPM was planning to purchase the government's stake in Isagen
together with Enron Corp. of the U.S. to avoid the anti-monopoly
regulations. AES Corp. of the U.S. and Union Fenosa of Spain were
also interested in Isagen, Caballero said last year.
