Subject: FW: Steve Peace Video Tape Update


Steve Peace's office called Bob Hertzberg's office back this morning and
told them that the video was incomplete and that they would send the tape as
soon as they finish making changes.

We are still trying to get a copy of the tape.  Our friends in the Speaker's
office will call Sen. Peace's Sacramento office today and try to get a copy
from the Sacramento staff.

Karen:

Our friends in the Speaker's office have requested for a copy of the Steve
Peace tape.  Mr. Peace's office is supposed to send a copy to the Speaker's
office next week.  We will Fed-Ex a copy to you as soon as we receive it.

Happy Thanksgiving.

Sandra
