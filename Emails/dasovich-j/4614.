For what its worth, I forgot to include the latest rumor, picked up
yesterday:
As a result of Julian Dixon's death, there's a free-for-all underway on
who's going to run for his Congressional seat.  Rod Wright is definitely
considering it, and has begun making phone calls to test the waters/gather
support.
