Dear Haas Community,

Wednesday,  Nov 22nd, between 7:00 and 8:00 AM portions of the Haas network
will be shut down for brief periods for upgrading.  Communications and
Network Services network technicians will be installing new network
equipment.   This is one of the steps required for the upgrade of the Haas
network  to switched 100 Megabit/second service.

The network service interruption should be short (less than 30
minutes)  and is scheduled as follows:

Wed. Nov 22nd, 7:00 to 8:00 AM:   Cheit Hall third floor classrooms, Wells
Fargo, S495, S497, and S499 (subnets 128.32.69 and 128.32.71) .

During the brief outages email will be held for later delivery.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the upgrades, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
