Hi Everyone,

Last month I announced a new seminar we're offering called "Show Me the
Money...The Perfect Pitch", taught by Peggy Klaus.  We will have signups
available in the office from Wednesday, March 15 through Friday March 24.

THIS IS NOT FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED.  Seats will be assigned according to
seniority in the program.

I've copied, below, the description of the seminar.  It should be great!

*****************

"You may have an incredible idea, the best product, or the most dynamic
company in the world.  But if you can't talk about your assets in ways that
make your audience as excited as you are, you've struck out.  Whether
asking for seed money for a start-up, taking the company public, or just
debriefing investors at a quarterly meeting, you will need compelling
presentation techniques that ensure a winning delivery.  This interactive
workshop is designed to keep you out of the bull-pen and on the mound,
pitching a perfect game with no walks and no errors."

This workshop will include assessments and enhancements of personal style
including creating a positive first impression; effective use of voice,
body language, and humor; and managing stage fright.

"The Perfect Pitch" will be taught by Ms. Peggy Klaus of Klaus &
Associates.  Peggy is an executive coach who trains executives, managers,
celebrities, professionals, media personalities, and political candidates
to project a more dynamic presence.  I'm really pleased that she has agreed
to join us, and I hope that you consider attending this workshop.


Cheers,

Diane
