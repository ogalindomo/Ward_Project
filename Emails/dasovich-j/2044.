I like the idea.  Particularly in view of the "California Crisis."  Makes our 
positions that much more compelling and offers at least part of the 
"solution" for California.

		 Subject: DG case

Jeff/Sue, what are your thoughts about trying to meet with commissioners or 
key staff to advance our quite reasonable positions in the DG case?  The 
Phase 1 ruling is only a month away.  It still baffles me that such contacts 
are permissible, but obviously the utilities are doing whatever they can to 
oppose our positions on UDC ownership, open access D tariffs, and standby 
rates.
