I have asked John Klauberg  of LeBoeuf Lamb to look at the letter.  Are we 
using Bracewell on matters relating to the PX? I do not know  who Ron Carroll 
is.

Do we need to add the PX letter to the agenda for tomorrow's 10 AM call?  If 
so, make sense to have Bracewell (Ron Carroll?) and Mike Day on as well?
