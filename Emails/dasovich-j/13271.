To the due diligence teams of Project Raven--

As you may have already heard, EBS decided this week not to pursue continued 
discussions with Raven.  I wanted to take the time to thank each of you for 
the many hours you put into the transaction.  I firmly believe that we did 
the most thorough due diligence possible given our time constraints and the 
relative disarray of Raven's organization.  Each diligence team pitched in 
with helpful suggestions and worked toward a common goal, and we should be 
proud of the manner in which we arrived at our conclusions.  But as is the 
rule in business, you win some and you lose some.  Regardless of the outcome, 
I sincerely appreciate your efforts and hope that we can meet up again on the 
next deal.  In the meantime, if you have any questions about the process or 
would like to tie up loose ends please fell free to stop by.

Thanks again,

Brad Richter
