Hi Continuing Evening MBA Students,

You may have recently received an invoice from the Registrar for Fall
2001.  Payment for Fall 2001 is not due until August 15, even though the
statement mentions a minimum amount due in May.  Just take a look at the
minimum amount due and most likely it says "$0".

If it is not $0, you may still have a balance for Spring 2001.  If so, you
can call Loans & Receivables with your questions at (510) 642-3190.

Thanks!
TJ
