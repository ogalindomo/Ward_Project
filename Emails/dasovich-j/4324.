There are only 19 shopping days until Christmas!  But even more importantly,
today is the LAST DAY to vote in the HaasWeek Survivor Contest!!!  Quick -
go to www.haasweek.net to place your vote and help choose our glorious
champion.  You can find out the results in the final issue of HaasWeek for
the semester, next Monday, but I will tell you now that it's currently way
too close to call.

Polls close at 5pm this evening, so vote now at www.haasweek.net.  Time is
running out...

Thanks,
HaasWeek
