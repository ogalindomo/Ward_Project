Doesn't jibe:  you've already been reimbursed $398.21 on your *last* expense 
report & check 
(called "Jeff07062001" for $2,069.38) -- this is your June bill we're talking 
about; 
don't think you've received your bill for July yet........unless you are 
trying to pay that now with this different amount 
(below) so now I'm not sure what you're doing - please clarify.

Thanks,
Joseph
