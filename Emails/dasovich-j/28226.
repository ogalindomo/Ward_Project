EBS Government Affairs Website Launched Today!


I am happy to announce that the EBS Government Affairs Website was launched 
today.  The site contains a wealth of information pertaining to the issues 
and projects that Sue Nord and her team are currently working on.

The site is located in the "Communities" section of the EBS intranet page, 
called wEBSource.  You can access the website by using this link:  
http://websource.enron.net/intranet/intranet.nsf/website/governmentaffairs.  
You may want to bookmark the site so you can access it easily in the future.

Please visit the site when you have some time and feel free to send comments 
or questions to me.



Thanks very much.
