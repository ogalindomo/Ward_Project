Hi guys!

Hope life is treating you well!  I am at my in-laws in up state NY in a
small town called Corning - I call it the small town with big millionaires
(have you checked out Corning stock lately???).  I couldn't sleep - so I
decided to ck. email (yes, it is actually 3:30am EST time!)

Anyways, beside writing to say hi and that I miss you guys...I wanted to let
you know that it is our lovely Jackie's B-day today - 8/22.  I wish I was
there to setup a happy hour for her big day...but since I am not, one of you
has to!  Give her my best and a big hug for me.

Later alligators,
Deepika
