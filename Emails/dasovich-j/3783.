While there are certainly pros and cons both ways, I agree with Jim to lead 
with the market structure issues.  This was the focus of FERC's order and we 
perhaps overemphasize the refund issue by elevating it to number 1.  Plus, we 
lose a little credibility since, like the UDCs, we would come across as, at 
bottom, primiarily concerned only with maximizing our financial position, and 
less concerned with trying to be a constructive force in shaping a 
competitive market in California.  That is not FERC's priority.  Finally, and 
I say this will great equivocation, I believe that FERC carefully drafted the 
refund language, that it knew exactly what it was doing, and is unlikely to 
move off that formulation either way.  The issue is still of utmost 
importance but for the foregoing reasons as well as those stated by Jim, I 
would prioritize it just below the $150 soft cap and prospective refund 
issue.  Ron

As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus
on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible
for business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think
that the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2)
reducing the burden/risk of the prospective refund period.

I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power
/ retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much
more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can
given the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds
become an issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later
fight this fight.

I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to
bring these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all
of our other arguments.

Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by
quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara,
can you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to
file?  I want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but
not getting too soft.

Jim
