> Calif Gov To Make 'Important' Energy Announcement Thurs 
> LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In a highly unusual move, California Gov. Gray
> Davis Tuesday requested radio and television stations in the state to
> clear five minutes of time Thursday evening so he can make an important
> announcement regarding the state's energy crisis. 
> Davis is expected to deliver a speech at 6:05 p.m. PST and will likely
> talk about the state's conservation efforts, a 4,000 megawatt shortfall
> expected next month, the need to bring new generation online, recent rate
> hikes ordered by the California Public Utilities Commission, and the
> possibility for further rate increases this summer to keep the state's
> three investor-owned utilities solvent, sources close to Davis told Dow
> Jones Newswires. 
> The source said Davis is not expected to discuss a final agreement to buy
> the power lines owned by PG&E Corp., unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison
> International's unit, Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy's
> unit, San Diego Gas & Electric. 
> Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, would not comment on Davis'
> speech. 
> In a memo to the media, Davis' office said the governor will "deliver an
> important live address on energy from his office in Sacramento. During
> this historic address to the people of California, the governor will speak
> in detail about California's energy emergency and make an important
> announcement." 
> The last time a California governor interrupted a broadcast schedules was
> in 1992, when Republican Gov. Pete Wilson delivered a speech about the
> state's budget problems, a spokesman in Davis' office said. 
> But Davis' staff said "this is the first time in recent memory that a
> Governor has asked for time statewide to deliver a live address to the
> people of California."
