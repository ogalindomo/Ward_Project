Folks-
Above is a link to the Governor's press release issued late yesterday on a
new bill he is working on with Senator Alpert and Assemblymember Davis. The
bill is now being identified as Senate Bill 1433 by Senator Alpert. The bill
is currently on the Assembly Floor. Senator Alpert, in the press conference
yesterday, said the bill could be amended and heard as early as TODAY!!!! I
will let you know as I hear more.

Thanks,
Delaney
