Jeff, please forward this to Prentice.  I will call Mom and Dad.

Finally, Mike and I are hosting Christmas Day at our house with a big assist
from Jeff on the dinner preparation.  I will probably do it the same way we
do Thanksgiving at Steve and Charry's by asking each of you to bring/make
something.  We are looking forward to having you all here.

Debbie
