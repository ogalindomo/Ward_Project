Here are two files I have assembled to assist in our discussions related to
legal budgeting.  The first is a list of open matter numbers which either a)
have been approved for some level of activity; or b) the attorneys assigned
to the case believe there may be some additional level of activity expected
or warranted in the future (in which case authorization will have to be
sought at the appropriate time).  The second list consists of matter numbers
we believe should be closed as we expect no more costs or activity in any of
these matters.  Please comment on either at your convenience.  I will
provide copies of them to Paul Kaufman tomorrow.  Mike Day
