Trade Application

The final version of the trade application for the launch of State 6.7 will be
posted behind the Participants only section in the folder entitled "Inter-SC
Trades" on Monday, September 18th.  We anticipate this will be the final 
version
of the trade application prior to launch.  We will send a market message when
the trade application is ready for download.

Market Simulation

This is our final week of market simulation. As of late Friday afternoon, we 
had
not been given any information regarding additional testing with the ISO 
direct,
however they have made the emmunlator available to us to turn schedules 
around.

NOTE: If you have not taken the opportunity to test your systems against the
trade application during previous market simulation days, we encourage you to
test with the trade application being posted today sometime this week.

DATA FREEZE

In preparation for the launch of Stage 6.7, there will be a data freeze
effective September 24th through October 11th.  To ensure the stability of our
