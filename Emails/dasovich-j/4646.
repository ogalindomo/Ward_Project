Jeff -  I know you are always looking for market opportunities and here's an
idea.  It is my understanding that ORA and SoCalGas have reached a tentative
agreement to blow-down and salvage the Montebello storage field.  The plan
(based on my previous knowledge) is to sell the inventory forward to capture
some of the prices we are seeing today.  I'd think Enron might be well
positioned to engage in this type of transaction (but I know there are many
in SoCalGas who would like to see anybody BUT Enron).  It is my
understanding also that there is 3 Bcf of working gas and about 24 Bcf of
cushion gas.  I don't think they plan on having the core sell it, so it
would be done in Lad's shop.  You might want to follow-up.
