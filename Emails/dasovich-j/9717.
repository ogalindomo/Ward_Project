Bill and Roger,

Thanks for the quick turn-around on the analysis.  I hope the weekend was not 
totally ruined.  After review of the study, we thought it would be useful to 
further expand the scenarios into a Worst, Base and Best Case.  The scenarios 
we would like you to run are outlined in the attached file.  Each scenario 
would reflect a wet, dry and normal weather case.
Please note that each scenario has a different date for surcharge 
implementation.  The Best Case reflects the date included in your original 
analysis.  Along those lines, would you please expand on the rationale for 
assuming the 1/01/02 implementation date.

In addition to reflecting the rate impact on a cents per kwh basis, please 
include a percent impact as well.

Like our original request, we are on a fast-track.  We would like to schedule 
a conference call for 2:30 p.m. central time Wednesday (March 7) to discuss 
the results of your analysis.  Hopefully, the data you have already generated 
can be quickly "massaged" to accomodate the scenarios requested.

Please call me at 713 853 3170 if you have any questions.

Robert
