Hi Everyone,

I'm pleased to announce that we have two new electives to offer next 
semester, as described below.  Please note that TJ will be sending you your 
class schedules via e-mail on Wednesday and that you have until Monday, 
November 20 at noon to adjust your schedules by responding back to TJ via 
e-mail (NOT TeleBEARS).  Please keep these two courses in mind as you 
consider your schedule adjustments.

REMEMBER!  The second round of pre-registration is not done on TeleBEARS - 
it's done via e-mail to TJ.  

(1) E296-10, Pricing (3 units; Thursdays 6:00 - 9:30 pm).  This course will 
be taught by Scott Davis (Stanford PhD; faculty member at Washington 
University and UC Davis; currently is a Principal at Strategic Marketing 
Decisions in Sacramento).  The objective of this course is to deepen your 
understanding of pricing issues faced by organizations and to develop pricing 
strategies that will be used to increase profitability.  More information is 
available in the attachments.  I think this is going to be a great course - 
Scott has great experience and has won the Outstanding Teacher award in the 
EvMBA Program at Washington University.

(2)  E296-9, Managing Innovation and Change (3 units; Tuesdays, 6:00 - 9:30 
pm;).  This course will be taught by David Palmer (Claremont [Drucker School 
of Mgmt] Ph.D., Wharton MBA; instructor at Santa Clara University; currently 
Partner at  Customer Manufacturing Group in Santa Clara).   This course will 
explore the organizational structures and management processes that 
facilitate or impede innovation.  Class requirements will include a major 
case project.  I believe that this course, too, will be excellent.

Cheers,

Diane
