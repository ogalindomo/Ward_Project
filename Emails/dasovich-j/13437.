The ALJ has confirmed that Commissioner Wood has amended an order about PX
credit modifications to include an end to direct access and placed it on the
agenda.  We do not have access to the proposed order to verify the precise
language.  The order is NOT an order from Commissioner Bilas as the agenda
improperly suggests.  Parties seeking to retain direct access rights should
contact Pres. Lynch and Commission Brown in particular, as well as
Commissioner Duque and Commissioner Bilas.  There is some indication that
Commission Bilas may prepare an alternate omitting the ban on direct access.
