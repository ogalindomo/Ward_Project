Hi Everyone,

I'm very excited to announce that Meg St. John has joined us in the Haas
Evening MBA program office as Assistant Director of the program.  Meg will
be working with Julie Ito and me in the admissions and marketing area, and
again with me in the student services area.  Meg earned her MBA at the
University of Washington (who we play next Saturday!), and most recently
she worked at the Federal Reserve Bank as a marketing research analyst, so
she brings a wonderfully strong set of skills to the evening office.

If you get a chance, please stop by and say hello to Meg!

Go Bears,

Diane
