Hi Everyone,

Each semester, Deans Tyson, Stowsky, and Shogan host two small dinners with
the Evening MBA students.  The deans invite 20 evening students to join
them during the break (7:30 - 8:15 pm) to talk informally about whatever
might be on the students' minds, while enjoying a sumptious meal not cooked
at Jimmy Bean's.

This semester, the two dinners will be held on Wednesday, November 10 in
the Helzel Board Room (next to Andersen Auditorium) and Tuesday, November
16 in C250.  You will need to sign up for these dinners in the office.
Please DO NOT respond to me directly by e-mail!

The deadline to sign up for the November 10th dinner is Thursday, November 4.

The deadline to sign up for the November 16th dinner is Thursday, November 11.

Cheers,

Diane
