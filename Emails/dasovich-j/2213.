I got a call from Christine around lunch, pointing out here input to 3 and
4.  I added one of here paragraph to #3.  Let me know immediately if you
disagree with the change.  We also need to talk tonight about how we're
going to coordinate these cases in the future.  I can't work on these cases
at work (I'm a supervisor in a union environment).  I got Christine's email
Sunday at 10:53 pm and it was not combined with Jeff and Kim's.  Lets make
sure we have a commitment tonight on how we're going to execute these in the
future!
