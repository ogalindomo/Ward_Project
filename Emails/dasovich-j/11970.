Hello,

Well, it's Wednesday, hump day.  It's mid-week and we're heading into the
weekend. It's also time when you get to experience CATERED DINNERS, again!
Yes, the glamour, comfort and joy of this wonderful event is going into
its third day.

Today's dinner will be:  ITALIAN BUFFET.

No, it's not pizza from Jimmy Bean's.  It's spaghetti from Jimmy Beans.
Those of you who have had pasta from Jimmy Bean know what a real treat
this is.  Just kidding, Jimmy Bean is not involved in this event.
