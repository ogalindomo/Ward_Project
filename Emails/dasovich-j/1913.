Attached is a draft of IEP's Comments on CAISO Amendment No. 31.  Due to the
heavy schedule next week, including the IEP meeting on Monday-Tuesday and
the CAISO CMR Board meeting on Wednesday, I don't think we will have time to
have a formal conference call to discuss this draft prior to filing on
Thursday.

Accordingly, please review and forward any comments to me [steven@iepa.com]
and Andy Brown [abb@eslawfirm.com] by noon on Wednesday, October 4.  Thanks.
