Dear DG Posse, 

Did anyone file protests on UDC tariff filings to implement new Rule 21?? Our 
sense is it was pro forma.?? Comments were due Monday.

Anyone find anything in Cooke's PD on interconnection to comment on next 
Monday?? If we can't comment Monday we could consider supporting in reply 
comments due the 18th.

Also, the PUC didn't docket CAC/EPUC's application to get the PUC to act at 
FERC re ISO EMS metering requirements and transmission charges.?? Grounds 
were procedural ("we only take applications from utilities we regulate"), and 
that the issues are already in the DG OIR.

Take care, 

PS I hear that gas prices are killing the economics of gas powered 
customer-side DG.? True?
