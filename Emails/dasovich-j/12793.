On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials 
developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to 
try to resolve it.  Attached are:

A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last 
week
A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more 
detailed "backgrounder."

If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give 
me a call at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
