Hi,

If you're not able to get into Bearfacts for your grades, try the "Change
Your Password" section.

Then proceed to "Current Passphrase."  If you haven't used this before, try
your PIN# or "password."

If that doesn't work, there is a link on the site that says log-in problems
to guide you.

We'll be sending grade letters next week!
Thanks!
TJ
