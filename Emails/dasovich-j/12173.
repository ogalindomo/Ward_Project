FYI - 

Public comments were recently posted in response to the FTC's February 2001 
notice seeking information regarding different regulatory approaches to 
competition in the retail sale of electricity.   Below is a list of 
contributors.

If you are interested, you may view comments at 
http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/eleccompetition/index.htm.  We have also 
posted the comments on the internal Deregulation Info Central site 
(http://eeshou-ln3.ees.enron.com/energyservices/deregulation.nsf/Home+Page/Sta
rt?opendocument).

Alternatively, I have a number of complete sets of all comments (the set 
comprises two big binders) at my desk.
