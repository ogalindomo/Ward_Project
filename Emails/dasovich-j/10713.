Q: What do we expect to be the main points of Governor Gray Davis' address=
=20
this evening?
CUEVAS: His office has said that the basic theme will be conservation.=20
Basically, he is trying to motivate everyone to conserve. Also, we are=20
expected to hear a stern warning involving the power situation this summer.=
=20
It is expected to be a warmer than average summer. Davis e is also going to=
=20
address that. We have also been told that he will make some sort of=20
announcement and that the announcement is being kept under tight wraps; it =
is=20
top secret. At this point we can=01,t even speculate as to what it will be.=
 But=20
there will be a big announcement.
It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will=
=20
start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT.




Q: How has the energy crisis affected the Governor's popularity?
CUEVAS: The latest polls -- and these were probably around Mid-March =01) s=
how=20
that his popularity and his approval ratings have declined. The latest poll=
=20
commissioned by the Service Employees International Union shows that only 2=
9=20
percent of those surveyed said that they would vote for Davis again. He,=20
however, is trying to distance himself from this energy problem saying that=
=20
it is the responsibility of the Republican lead Senate and Legislature who=
=20
were the ones that passed these deregulation laws and that basically, he ju=
st=20
got handed the problem and he is trying to solve it.=20
There was the first ever state Democratic convention in Orange County last=
=20
weekend =01) Orange County has traditionally been highly Republican. Everyb=
ody=20
there said that they supported Governor Davis and that they believe that th=
e=20
Democratic Party in this state will not be affected by this crisis, that th=
ey=20
are basically trying to fix what the previous administration did.
Q: What impact will the California energy crisis have on Davis=01, politica=
l=20
future?
CUEVAS: Davis says that it will not impact his future. He feels very=20
confident that he has been able to send out the message that he is not=20
responsible for this crisis and that he is doing everything in his power to=
=20
fix it. One of the things that he mentioned in a press conference on Saturd=
ay=20
is that there are already new electrical plants that are under construction=
=20
that should be ready by either 2004 or 2005. He says that he is doing=20
everything in his power to be able to solve this crisis. Again, as things=
=20
worsen and as the rolling blackouts begin and continue over the summer,=20
obviously, everybody is trying to find somebody to blame and he is in the=
=20
perfect position. That is why a lot of fingers are being pointed toward him=
.
Q: What actions has the Governor taken so far to try to avert the energy=20
crisis?
CUEVAS: One of the things that he has approved is the construction of new=
=20
energy plants. Also, he is asking that private companies and other large=20
power users be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. This=
=20
is different than what the Public Utilities Commission had been arguing for=
.=20
He has also put forth called the 20/20 plan that says that if you save 20=
=20
percent on your consumption of energy as compared to last summer, you will=
=20
get 20 percent off your energy bill for the four summer months. He is doing=
=20
everything in his power, he says, to try and avoid an even higher rate=20
increase. However, there are a lot of people who are arguing for a higher=
=20
rate and saying that would be the only way to try and stop this crisis.
Q: Do you have any final thoughts to share?
CUEVAS: When you go down to the consumers themselves, everyone is trying to=
=20
make sure that the average resident is not the one footing the bill for the=
=20
problems that are taking place at the governmental level. There seems to be=
 a=20
lot of frustration from both residents and businesses. There was a symposiu=
m=20
at UCLA yesterday where the Anderson Business Forecast, a group that usuall=
y=20
does economic forecast for the state of California, said their concern was=
=20
that California would be affected in the long run. They said that those tha=
t=20
are thinking about doing business in California might be hesitant and might=
=20
look at other states that do not have this uncertainty with the energy=20
situation and therefore, may not establish operations in California. That w=
as=20
one of the biggest concerns. Right now California ranks number 48 or 49 in=
=20
energy consumption so it is very energy efficient and aware as far as=20
conservation efforts. So, hopefully, by conserving they might be able to ge=
t=20
past this summer and have a solution by the end of the year.
