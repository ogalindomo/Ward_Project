As promised, these are my section notes from Saturday.  Note, there are
always some ad-libbed parts, and comments and questions from students
that are not in these notes.

I've attached the file as a Word97 file.  If you have problems reading
this or importing it, let me know.  I also plan to have prof. Levine
post it on the class web site.
