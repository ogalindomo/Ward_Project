Jim and Harry:

This is our proposed amendment to fix the "ban" on direct access.  It
works off of the concept of CMA, which allows the CUC to impose some
conditions or fees, but it clarifies that the CPUC can't hit direct
access customers with costs they didnt cause.  Call Sandi ASAP to
confirm approval.  We need to get this to staff within 30 minutes or it
will be too late.

 Thanks for the fast turn around.   Mike Day
