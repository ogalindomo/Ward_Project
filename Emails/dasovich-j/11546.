Moveon.org, a group that positions itself as an internet based consumer 
watchdog, has mounted a campaign in support of the Federal Energy Reliability 
and Stability Act of 2001.  The campaign takes direct aim at enron, dynegy 
and other companies. Have a look at their website, at 
http://www.moveon.org/priceshocked/index.html.  In the meantime, here's a 
copy of a mass, unsolicited email that someone at our PR Firm in NY (ss+k) 
received from moveon.org (see below).

Dear Friend of MoveOn,

Energy prices are skyrocketing across the nation, yet Washington is
doing nothing.  Energy producers are taking huge windfall profits. 
Consumers and taxpayers are given the shaft.

Enough is enough.  Join our citizens' campaign by sending an instant
email to your representatives in Washington.  Go to:

   http://www.moveon.org/priceshocked/index.html

The energy markets are controlled by a small number of companies --
Enron, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant, etc -- which supply local utilities
throughout the country with gas and power.  These companies are so
big, they are more like monopolies than players in a price-competitive
market.  Their irresponsible behavior calls for a strong federal hand.

In California alone, these companies and their affiliates have already
overcharged by more than $6.3 billion (1).  If nothing is done, the
number is expected to rise to as much as $70 billion (2).  That's $2,000
for every man, woman, and child in the state.

This may be the biggest scam ever to hit the U.S. -- potentially
dwarfing the Savings and Loan mess of the 80s.  Yet FERC, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Bush administration are taking
no action.

A new bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein (D-CA), Smith (R-OR), and
Lieberman (D-CT), would direct FERC to set temporary "cost-plus" rates
allowing wholesalers to charge a reasonable rate of profit, not the
excessive premiums they are now charging.

Join us in voicing your support for this important bill at:

Thank you for your help.  And pass on the word.  We cannot let this
go unchallenged.

Sincerely,

-Wes Boyd

P.S. Beware myths spread by the energy lobby.  
     Here are two corrections:

- Rising demand in California HAS NOT created the problem.  California's
monthly peak electricity demand actually declined in July, August,
October, and December of 2000 relative to the same months in 1999 (4).

- More drilling and relaxed environmental standards ARE NOT the answer.
Opening new domestic supplies takes decades and only adds months of
additional supply (5).  Increased efficiency, immediate investment in
renewables, and market stabilization are the only short term answers.
