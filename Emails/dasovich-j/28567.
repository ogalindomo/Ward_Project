Hey Guys,

Molly and I are having two West Point Inn parties in August and we would
love you guys to come to one or both of them.  Jeff, it would be great if
you could bring the ice again.  Below is the e-mail with all the info.
 Hope to see you soon.

Sean

Hey Everyone,

Attached below are invites to a couple of overnight affairs I am organizing
up on Mt. Tam in August.  I have reserved the West Point Inn on both August
4 and August 18th.  It is usually a great great time.  People hike up
there, and hang out all
afternoon and evening and then sleep over.  We cook dinner and do various
things in the evening (ie games, singing, guitar, etc.).  EVERYONE helps
with the process (ie cooking, cleaning, etc.).  In the morning we will make
up breakfast.

The cost is $50 per person.  This covers lodging ($30 per person), snacks,
dinner, drinks, and breakfast.  People should not have to bring anything to
eat or drink except for maybe water for the hike.

I usually try to have a mix of couples and singles to make it fun for
everyone.  I hope you can make it.  Let me know if you are interested.

Sean
