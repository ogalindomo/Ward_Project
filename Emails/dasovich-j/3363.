John:

I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting.
Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in
the papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's
taking up a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to
reschedule for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
