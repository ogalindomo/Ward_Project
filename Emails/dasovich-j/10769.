Folks, I need your help:

Fast approaching is Sue Mara's next birthday.  She has made it 
verrrrrrrrrrrry clear to me (ahem) that she does not want a lot of attention 
or fuss; however, I do think it would be nice if she received a card with 
lots of signatures and well wishes!

Therefore, this is what I propose:  In order to be as discreet and "secret" 
as possible, *please* send your birthday wishes to her to my attention via 
this e-mail address and I will then print out each person's missive and 
enclose it with a card.

If you are interested in submitting something to me on Sue's behalf, PLEASE 
get it to me by THURSDAY, April 15th!!! [just think tax time, LOL!]

Again, please submit via this e-mail only to:  joseph.alamo@enron.com

THANKS SO MUCH in advance for your participation!
