FYI - today we received a copy of the order indicating that EBS's Rhode 
Island application has been approved effective November 1, 2000.  The tariff 
was allowed to go into effect on November 1, 2000.  EBS must send registered 
notification to the Commission when we commence operation in Rhode Island.  
The Order outlines the applicable fees and taxes that EBS will then be 
required to pay.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
