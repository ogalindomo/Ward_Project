Also quite a lot about how lax FERC is in using what subpoena powers it does 
have to get information it needs to really see what's going on.

Subject: San Jose article Criticizing FERC

Attached is a two-part series article (from this past Saturday and Sunday) 
from the San Jose Mercury News on FERC, the energy crisis, and FERC's 
inability to monitor the markets (and it's cozy relationship with industry).  
Apparently it is making the rounds at FERC and causing quite a bit of agita...

I've read through Part 2, and so far it's all on the power side, but there 
are quite a few FERC staff, both policy, enforcement and economists, 
mentioned and criticized.
