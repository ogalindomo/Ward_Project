Jim Steffes asked me to call Seabron Adamson to get his take on what a "Top 
5" list should include for California.  Seabron sent me the attached list, 
which, as you will notice, is just his first cut on this.  I thought it might 
be helpful for everyone for the conference call today -- but please remember 
that this is really just a first attempt at putting the problems down on 
paper.

Subject: California "Top Five" list



Sarah:

Please find attached a "top five" list on California market reform, as
requested, with some annotations on why I think these changes would be
beneficial etc. It is quite rough - not much more than a brain dump really -
but can serve as a basis for discussion.

Have a look and see what you think. Perhaps we should set up a call to
discuss sometime later this week?
