 I just saw this monster bill on the Senate website.  It is a
Keeley-Hertzberg bill that looks like it is intended to be the Hertzberg
version of the MOU.  It was just introduced yesterday.  Does anyone have
info on what the story is with this bill?  I have not finished reviewing it
but it does prohibit additional direct access until January 2003.  It
clearly does not have our recommended DA language in it.  Mike Day
