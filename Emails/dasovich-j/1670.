Folks-
Here is the FINAL (and I mean final) draft of the letter to Governor Davis.
You will note that the signatorries list has reduced. If you are still
listed and DO NOT want to be send me an email and I will take you off. If
you are not listed and YOU WANT to be added also send me an email. If you
are listed and YOU STILL WANT to be please fax to my office your signature
(thank you to Bill Booth and Bill Dombrowski for already doing this) and I
will place it on the letter.

Thank you to all of you for your work on this letter. Also, sincere
apologies from me to those parties who feel they were not properly
represented in the letter. It was never my intention to cause a rift between
any of our members with inclusion or exclusion of language or issues. I have
struggled this week with the letter. Tony Braun's question about how the
Group should deal with disagreements between members made me think that
maybe we ought not send the letter under AB 1890 Group banner but rather let
the signatures speak for themselves. I am entertaining your thoughts on this
subject -- granted answers come back on Monday morning so that I can get the
letter out by MONDAY AFTERNOON.

Hope everyone has a beautiful and restful weekend. I look forward to working
with each and everyone of you on the issues facing us all.

Take Care,
Delaney
