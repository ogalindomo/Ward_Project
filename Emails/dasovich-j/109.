Dennis,

I spoke with Rick Counihan from Green Mountain who is closely following this 
issue.  He told me that the Commission is scheduled to issue a final decision 
on the CEC credit on Nov. 17.  He spoke with CPUC staff who will be 
recommending that the credit be reduced by 0.25 cents/kWh beginning December 
1, 1999 through June 30, 2000.  Beginning in March or April of next year, 
discussions will resume on what adjustments will be made beginning July 1, 
2000.
