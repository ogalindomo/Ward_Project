Subject: FERC Valentine: Order on ISO Amend.  36: Creditworthiness
Importance: High


The FERC issued an  order today on ISO's unilateral relaxation of the 
creditworthiness standards for  PG&E and SCE.? The decision is available at 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower/ER01-889-000.pdf.?  In the order, 
the FERC allows the utilities to self schedule for their own  generation, but 
does not allow the relaxation of creditworthiness standards as  it would 
apply to transactions with third parties.? Stated differently, the  utilities 
can schedule at the ISO for load served by their own resource, but  they have 
to meet the ISO tariff creditworthiness requirements if they are  buying 
generation from anyone else.? This means that ISO can't "dump"  imbalance / 
AS costs on the utilities if DWR doesn't buy it.? It also  indirectly 
addresses the Reliant, et. al. / ISO TRO suit, as well as Duke's suit  
against ISO and DWR.? ABB
