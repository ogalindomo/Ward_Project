		 Subject: Paper on gas diversion, curtailment, etc.

Here is the paper in its latest form.  We are still waiting for the rest of 
the interstate pipeline tariffs to be summarized and I will have to add 
Keyspan and Peoples when I get the tariffs.  Paul, you may want to have Mike 
Smith do more of a discussion of the issues, as the bullets are not always 
that informative, but see what you think.  Thanks.  And Becky, when I print 
out the document, the pipeline matrix gets lopped off.  How do I fix that?
