Note, as the Hearing is Thursday, we are working in  real time to finalize 
this Statement.? This is a work in progress.?  IEP will be translating the 
draft outline into prose continually between now and  Wed noon, when we hope 
to finalize the Statement.
?
As a point of reference, building off the IEP  Workshop we held last Friday, 
IEP is moving forward to develop detailed comments  for the FERC proceeding 
on California market structure matters? These  comments are due Nov. 22.? We 
anticipate these Comments to be detailed  (e.g. 20-50 pages).
?
This Statement for the FERC Hearing on Thursday is  building off of the 
discussion during the IEP workshop.? The Statement is  expected to be 5-10 
pages, therefore by necessity it will be less substantive  and exhaustive as 
the Nov 22 filing.? We are attempting to hit the 'high  points" and provide a 
framework for FERC to (1) consider the specific details of  their proposal, 
and (2) address certain FERC/state matters regarding roles and  
responsibilities.
?
We will be developing "talking points" as well, but  these will be driven by 
the overall Statement.
?
Talk to you tomorrow.
