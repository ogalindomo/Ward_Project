Mike, here is the edited document.  I have changed references to "Enron's" 
meters to "University's" since they either own or lease them.  I have also 
deleted references to "billing" data, since these meters will no longer be 
providing that.  For example, if we proceed with installing the adapters, the 
billing data will still come from the SCE meter.  The data from the 
University meter will be used to populate Energy Sense and for any other type 
of usage report they may request.

Hope this is clear.  Let me know if anyone has questions.

Mike, there are several comments in Natividad's Declaration that I would like 
to revise.  Maurice Winter is currently reviewing it for accuracy on the 
meter aspects.  When do you need this?

Attached are my comments to all declarations.  For the most part they look 
great.  

I have no comments on Navidad's (the metering expert)--but I ask Evan and 
Diann to review for accuracy.  I would also like Peggy and Jeff to review 
very carefully Dennis' declaration--there are several direct statements about 
our hedging strategy and our financial losses under the UCCSU K that will 
become public.  We either need to be comfortable with these statements or 
tone them down.  This is very important.

Please send me any comments.  MDS
