=09=09 Subject: Action Items from IEP Lobbyist Call

Summary of action items from today's IEP member company lobbyist conference
call:

Discussion re: SB 28x (Sher) and direct access

- Chris Ellison and I are meeting with staff from Sher and Wright=01,s offi=
ces
to discuss amendments to SB 28x to make it more comprehensive.  I will
report to IEP and members the results of the meeting in my weekly
legislative status report tomorrow.

- IEP has an appointment with Asm. Cox on Tuesday at 8:30 am.  The message
to him is support linking SB 28x and a direct access bill with SB 5x, and
oppose =01&California first=018 language and changes to the outage and main=
tenance
coordination (i.e., AB 60x, AB 8x, and SB 39x).  IEP members are invited to
join.  Please let me know if you are going to attend.  I will report to IEP
members the results of the meeting.

- In the meantime, since SB 28x is likely to be heard on Monday, all
available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members of
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee to support SB 28x with
the caveat that we would like to see some additional changes.

Discussion re: AB 60x (Hertzberg)

- Available IEP member company lobbyists should make contact with members o=
f
the Senate Energy Committee to oppose AB 60x.  The message is twofold: 1)
the bill creates another obstacle in the siting process when the state
should be streamlining it; and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be
sending the wrong signals to its neighboring states that send us power in
our time of need.  I will forward under separate cover the agreed-upon
amendments that we would be willing to live with if we can=01,t kill the bi=
ll.

Discussion re: AB 8x (Migden)

-  All available IEP member company lobbyists will, once again, make contac=
t
with Assembly Member Migden's office to support a meeting to discuss IEP=01=
,s
proposed amendments to make this bill work.
