Rick has scheduled a  meeting for Thursday, February 15 to discuss the 
national campaign around California.  The meeting will take place in Houston, 
TX. and at the moment, I am in the process of locating a meeting space, but I 
wanted each of you to be aware of this meeting so you could block your 
calendar.  The meeting will begin at 11:30am (CST) and conclude by 3:30pm 
(CST).  If for any reason you are unable to attend this meeting, please 
inform Rick via e:mail or v:mail.

I will keep everyone apprised of the meeting location and please feel free to 
call me if you have any questions.

I would also like to request confirmation of your attendance and if overnight 
accommodations are needed, please let me know that as well.
