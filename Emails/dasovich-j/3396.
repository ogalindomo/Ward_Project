Good news, Chris received the ok from little b, and is able to join our
team.

Attached is the spreadsheet that we worked on thus far.

We should probably set up a time to meet this week.

If we are all going to be at school tonight, why don't we head up to the
i-house and discuss a suitable meeting time for all of us at the break.  If
you guys already have plans, how about the first five minutes of the break
outside of Jimmy Beans?

See you soon,
Jackie
