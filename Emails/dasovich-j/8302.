Jeff and Sue,
 
I have a potential lead which may be of interest to Enron.  However, I don't 
know if you have any interest in Eastern European projects.  
 
Who would you suggest talking to with regard to a Bulgarian power plant 
development?  It involves a 25 year requirements contract with the national 
energy company, the retrofit of two existing units and building three new 
hydro units.  Total around 450 MW.  Party with exclusive deal with government 
wants to deal with an engineering company who could finance and do work ( @ 
$160 million).  Any suggestions on how to proceed?  My guess is that few 
engineering companies are into financing these days, particularly in emerging 
nations.  However, what are your thoughts/suggestions?
 
Thanks, and Happy New Year!
 
Dan
