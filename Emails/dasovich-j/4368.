Subject: Revised CalJournal Ad


IEP Team,
Attached is a revised January CalJournal ad for your review. Based on
the group's comments, which were significant, we have developed an
entirely new ad. However, since the deadline has not changed (art is
still due today), we need your feedback asap. Please e-mail or call me
at 916-447-8186 as soon as possible with any comments. If we do not hear
from you, we will assume you are fine with the ad as is. Thank you for
all of your help.
Kelli
