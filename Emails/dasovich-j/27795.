Good evening:

At this point, I have received only two redline edits (from Mike Florio
and Ann Cohn) of the issues draft I circulated last evening.  I have
attached them for your reference, but will not merge comments until we
have a "complete" set.

Please let me know if you plan to provide redline comments prior to
Thursday's meeting or whether we should merge comments without you.
