IEP's conference facilities hold up to 18  persons.? As we do not know how 
many folks are coming to the IEP  Restructuring/Transmission Task Force 
meeting, PLEASE RSVP TO DEBBIE CLINE AT  IEP@IEPA.COM].? Thanks. We we get  
overbooked, we will attempt to locate an alternate spot.
?
Note, the original purpose of the  meeting was to develop an IEP response to 
the various FERC filings on the  California market structure.? Given the FERC 
Nov. 1 Report, we will be  focusing on responding to that Report.?? The IEP 
recommendations  should not change much.?  IEP will be attending the Nov. 9 
FERC Conference  on these issues.

Subject: IEP Restructuring/Transmission  Task Force Meeting Scheduled for 
9:30 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 3

IEP has scheduled a Restructuring/Transmission  Task Force meeting for 9:30 
a.m. on Friday, Nov. 3.? The meeting will be  held here at IEP.? While we 
would prefer an in-person meeting, we will  also provide teleconferencing 
capabilities for those who would like to  participate by phone.
?
The purpose of the meeting will be to review and  discuss the draft IEP 
response to the various FERC filings addressing a  dysfunctional market in 
California and alledging generator/marketer market  power abuse.? As noted in 
our previous email, IEP is developing a  response to these FERC filings 
compatible to the work being accomplished by  the Market Response Project.? 
?
In addition to reviewing and discussing the draft  response, we will be 
discussing specific recommedations to the FERC/CPUC/EOB,  etc. to improve the 
functioning of the marketplace.? We will be  circulating prior to the meeting 
the latest thinking on this, and we expect to  discuss in detail the range of 
recommendations which might be inserted into  the FERC response filing.? This 
will be a followup to the IEP Board  discussion on Wednesday at IEP's Annual 
Meeting.
?
A draft agenda for the meeting is as  follows:
?
