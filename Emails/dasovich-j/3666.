Hello Gang,

I am leaving town Wed, not to return until Monday.  So I will work on the 
next case tonight (early questions) and send what I have to the team.

According to our schedule, I am supposed to be coordinating this 
case.  Jeff - can I switch this one with the Daimler-Chrysler case 
(assigned to you)?
