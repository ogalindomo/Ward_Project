		 Subject: Asian Regulatory Affairs

Dear all:

Due to the departure of David Merrill we will have to re-organise our 
regulative effort for Asia. Mark Schroeder has asked me to co-ordinate our 
efforts for Asia excluding India for the time until we will hire a regulatory 
manager for this region.

Since I have not been involved in all issues, we decided that I will come to 
Houston next week in order to meet as many of you as possible in order to get 
a clearer understanding of the pending questions. I asked Beverley Ashcroft 
to schedule individual meetings with you for the period between Tuesday, 16/1 
and Friday, 18/1.

Could you please indicate a time for a meeting and where your offices are 
located. After Beverley will have brought everything into schedule,we will 
confirm. Her direct line is +44 207 783 53 02.Thanks.

I look forward to seeing you soon
