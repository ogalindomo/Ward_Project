Thanks for the update! - In the future, you will need to spell my name 
completely - there are too many smiller's!

I am planning a trip to San Fran to meet with PG&E (tentatively June 6)  - 
will make sure I stop by to meet you.

Regards,

Stephanie

Got a message from PG&E.  Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll 
be accepting bids up to 30 years.  Will talk to PG&E and get back with more 
information.  If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.

Best,
JEff
