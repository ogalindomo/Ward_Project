To follow-up on the section 214 licensing issue, I spoke with Robin Hill and 
found out that Networks YK is 100% owned by the Netherlands BV, which in turn 
is 100% owned by EBS, Inc.  

In addition, my contact at the FCC confirmed that, with our existing 
ownership structure, Networks YK would be able to use the 214 authority of 
EBS, Inc.   As a result, EBS, Inc., would need to send a one-paragraph letter 
to the Secretary of the FCC (and a copy to the Telecommunications Division of 
the International Bureau) referencing its license number to invoke 
authorization and listing its intervening subsidiaries to better assist the 
FCC with identifying the chain.  In addition, we would need to certify in the 
letter that the chain is entirely 100%-owned, which is not a problem in this 
case -- but an issue that we will need to monitor and address in the future 
with regard to other foreign entities.  

Finally, this is a one-time notification process.  The only cause for 
providing additional notification relates to a change in ownership of the 
subsidiary or a name change.

Please let me know if anyone has any other questions or concerns.

Regards,

Lara
