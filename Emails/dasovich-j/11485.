I have just been informed by my inestimable -- dare I say indefatigable?? -- 
colleague, [the soon-to-be-Mrs.] Lysa Akin, that the previously selected time 
conflicts with a Rick Shapiro conference call and therefore, the Staff 
meeting is now moved up to 8:00 AM, same day (Friday, the 27th).

Thanks,
Joseph
