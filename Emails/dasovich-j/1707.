		 Subject: PLEASE READ AND RESPONED

As Rick mentioned at the staff meeting in DC, we are compiling a list of 
suggested names for Presidential appointments under either a Bush or a Gore 
administration.  Please forward your suggestions, along with a sentence or 
two explaining why you are recommending an individual, no later than Friday, 
September 29.  Also, if there are potential candidates about whom we should 
be concerned, please forward that information.
 
The attached documents describe the current make-up of various federal 
commissions, including the party affiliation and term dates for current 
members.   Cabinet and agency appointments are listed as well.

 Please send your recommendations directly to Ginger, either in hard copy or 
electronically.  Thanks in advance for your input.
