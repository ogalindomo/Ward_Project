Attached for your information is the final work product of IEP, CCC, and
PG&E related Section 390 Matters.  This work product integrates gas and
non-gas QF matters for PG&E, and provides a non-gas QF solution for SCE.
The gas-fired solution for SCE, related to CAC,will require further
discussion.  This document also solves for QFs in SDG&E territory by
essetially applying the PG&E gas-fired solution to that context.

The legislature voted out AB1-X today, then apparently left for the weekend.
We expect Mr. Keeley to review the IEP,CCC, PG&E proposal, and proceed
accordingly.  Hopefully, this next step will be to move our draft
legislative language to Leg Counsel for their use.  This should occur soon,
and Leg Counsel language should be available tomorrow (at the earlies) or no
later than Monday morning.

We will brief the IEP membership on the status of stuff during our regular
5:00 p.m. cc.
