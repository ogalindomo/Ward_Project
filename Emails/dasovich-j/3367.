segment (see attached file).



2.  Review and discuss Dave Merril's note on Korea.

3.  Step through a specific US/Korea trading example as in point one above.

4.  Time permitting, step through a US/Japan trading example, specifically 
determining what a hypothetical Singapore trading desk could and could not do 
with respect to each piece of the international capacity segment.

5.  Time permitting, determine the best general trading structure for Asia 
and highlight specific problem areas that need to be identified with respect 
to the structure.
