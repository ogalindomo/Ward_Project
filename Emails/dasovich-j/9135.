Sorry, but could you please print these out for me?  If the "eei.doc" is too

Best,
Jeff

John,
For the call at 4, here are some contractual provisions, and a piece on CPUC 
talking points.  These are very much still in process and we reserve the 
right to modify our language or add new terms, but wanted to show you where 
we are in our thinking at this point. ----cgy
