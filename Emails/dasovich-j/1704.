All,

Just doing a bit of research here. Check this out:

It's the town of Todos Santos just north of Cabo. It might fit all the
conditions all of us are looking for. You can try to find out about the
weather, and water temps, Cameron. But I don't think we should venture all
the way to mainland Mex. Just too much of a pain. And don't confuse Todos
Santos the town with Isla de Todos Santos (the island), which has waves as
big as Waimea and Maverick's. I shiver just thinking about it, considering a
ten-foot wave about ruined me in Costa.

Thanks for dinner last night Jeff. It was great to see y'all again. PP, get
out your Spanish index cards: Perro. P-E-R-R-O.

Late!
