All,

Thanks to everyone who attended the EBS strategy session in New Orleans last 
week.  I know how busy everyone is and Donald and I greatly appreciate your 
willingness to work with us to better support EBS and Enron's communications 
interests.  I would be happy to follow up with anyone who didn't get a chance 
to make it.  I am attaching our meeting notes, to be followed (due to size 
concerns) by the presentations from EBS Network Development and EBS Sales.  I 
am in DC this week, so if anyone needs to contact me, try my cell at 
503-807-2935.  Thanks.
