Neil,

I am not really plugged into this issue.  I have been focusing on running the 
west delivery curve development, CA retail, and new systems development.  
Give Sue or Jeff a call, they will have better intuitions.

Roger, 

When you have a second would you fill me in on where you think this issue 
will end up ?  Currently October NP15 is trading at 120 - I don't want to buy 
it if there is a chance that there will be a price cap at 100.00.  I'd also 
like to discuss our cost if we are short ? I assume 100 for expost and 100 
for replacement ? total 200

thanks 

NFB
