=09=09 Subject: PG&E Motion For Special Hearings



PG&E has filed the attached?=01&Motion for Further Proceedings  Regarding=
=20
Implementation of the California Department of Water Resources (DWR)  Reven=
ue=20
Requirement Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 360.5 and Water  Code=
=20
Sections 80002.5 and 80110.=018? The Motion requests that the Commission =
=20
provide an opportunity for expedited evidentiary hearings and development o=
f=20
a  formal record on the calculation, allocation, rate design and=20
implementation of  DWR=01,s revenue requirement and Fixed DWR Set-Aside und=
er AB=20
1X and the  Commission=01,s decisions implementing AB 1X.? The Motion does =
not=20
request any  Commission proceedings to review the reasonableness or amount =
of=20
DWR=01,s revenue  requirement.? However, without hearings and a formal reco=
rd on=20
the  allocation of DWR=01,s revenue requirement, PG&E contends that there i=
s a =20
significant risk of disagreement and litigation among interested parties an=
d=20
DWR  over the allocation of DWR=01,s revenue requirement and the revenue=20
requirement  needed by the utilities to continue serving their retail=20
customers and paying  their existing power suppliers.? The utility also mak=
es=20
the dramatic  statement that:
?
"If it takes interested parties 24 hours a day, seven days a week locked in=
 =20
a room together to reach this consensus and secure the revenue stream for=
=20
both  DWR and the utilities, PG&E is willing to devote the time, effort and=
 =20
resources to do so."
?
With regard to DA suspension, PG&E states that, "Finally, in a June 12, =20
2001, letter to interested parties, the DWR, State Treasurer=01,s Office an=
d =20
Department of Finance requested certain protections against customers who=
=20
might  seek to avoid paying DWR=01,s revenue requirement by switching to=20
alternative  energy providers under direct access programs, an issue which=
=20
would need to be  resolved by the Commission or the Legislature prior to=20
implementation of DWR=01,s  revenue requirement."? There is no other refere=
nce=20
to DA suspension, but  this makes it sound as if the issue would be inclujd=
ed=20
in the proceeding  proposed by PG&E.
?
Under the expedited schedule proposed by PG&E, the Commission would be  abl=
e=20
to issue a final decision on all DWR revenue requirement issues by July 26,=
 =20
2001(although the caption for this section says July 19, the text and a=20
schedule  shows the later date).? DWR testimony would be due on June 27 and=
 =20
intervenor and utility testimony on July 2.
