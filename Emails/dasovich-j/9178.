This is to alert you that FERC has put both the Amoco/Burlington complaint 
about Topock and the KN complaint about east end mainline capacity on the 
agenda for next Wednesday's meeting.  Specific sub-dockets include Enron's 
and Cook Inlet's protests of the allocation procedure for released capacity, 
i.e., SoCal's assignment to its replacement shippers of only non-SoCal/Topock 
rights.

I will get a copy of the draft order as soon as it is available and advise 
you of FERC's decision.  Based on the inclusion of the KN complaint, they may 
be ready to decide whether or not to require El Paso to address allocation of 
receipt point rights.
