Delaney,

Note that I haven't passed these by Annie, but I believe she'd agree with
the suggestions.

1.   I don't find any reference to this new definition being used in the
language.  If that is the intent, then I believe that we need to strike
this definition .

"New Large Customer" is a Large Customer which  either has not taken
electric service from an electrical corporation in California prior to
the effective date of this bill, or has been taking Direct Access
service continuously since April 30, 2000.


2.  At the start of Section 2, I believe the 2003 should be 2002.

(1) On or before July 1, 2003, the CPUC shall approve electrical
corporation tariffs describing Core Service, Term Service and Spot
Market Service to be available to customers beginning at the Transition
Date.

3.  Not my issue, but I recall that it was agreed to keep the following one
thing from Jeff's efforts yesterday.

365.2       The provision of Water Code Section 80110 requiring the
commission to suspend the right of customers to engage in direct access
and take electric service from an alternate provider is hereby repealed.
