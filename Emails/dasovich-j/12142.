Hi All- 

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also 
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit 
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically 
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please 
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables 
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see 
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password 
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I 
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on 
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if 
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you 
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also 
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be 
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have 
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has 
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices 
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

Thanks,
April Hrach
