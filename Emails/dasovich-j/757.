Folks,

Today the FERC issued an Order on SDG&E's complaint to cap generator
bids at $250, and they did so not only with a flat denial, but also by
opening a Section 206 Proceeding to investigate California's wholesale
power markets.  That means there will be full evidentiary hearing at
FERC regarding California's wholesale market.  WPTF is an intervenor in
the case, and I think we should discuss WPTF's strategy and position on
this case before the next Board meeting (September 12).

Toward that end, I have asked Rob Lamkin, our Chairman, to establish a
date for a Board teleconference call to discuss our position, craft a
motion, and vote.  I have also asked Dan Douglass to review the attached
Order of FERC (both docs are the same, but slightly different computer
format), prepare a summary, and to prepare an estimate for WPTF's
participation.  I would be more than happy to be a witness in the case.

I am also sending this notice to our general member representative who
may wish to be participants in our pleading.  Whereas the general
members can not vote on WPTF's major positions, they can participate in
the case development, funding, and preparation.

I will inform you of the date and time for our teleconference Board
meeting in a later e-mail.
