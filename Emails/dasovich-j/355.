Jeff:
Nice meeting you last Thursday. We will send the (lengthy) Application
for CPCN and tariff(s) this week for your review. I know Anita faxed
some additional material, but will also supplement that per our
discussions.
    I did lobbying in Sacramento and know the legislature's compulsion
for telecom. "consumer" issues - you mentioned SB 1217 (Richard Alarcon)
which did pass through Deb Bowen's committee and the Senate, but which
is going nowhere in the Assembly (Wright's committee).  This bill re
open access is contrary to Federal law and to the FCC's hands-off
stance, and appears dead.  There is still the ongoing debate in Portland
(and SF) which will turn on an upcoming 9th Cir. court decision (due any
day now).  The 9th Cir. could breathe life into this issue by allowing
Portland's open access mandate via the transfer of the franchise
agreement. Also note today's WSJ article re AOL's new found quandry.
The tide is against open access for the moment.
    Please call or email if you have nay questions whatsoever.
