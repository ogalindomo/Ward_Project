Can we discuss? For future purposes only , we need to change our message a 
bit on power pools- the problem is not the existence of a pool through which 
all transactions clear in real-time( we like and want that),....rather, the 
problem in California was exposing consumers and the utilities nakedly to the 
volatility of the spot market by effectively  prohibiting hedging  contracts. 
This is an important distinction and one we need to be clear on so we don't 
trip over our advocacy and the desires of our commercial counterparts. 
Thanks.,
