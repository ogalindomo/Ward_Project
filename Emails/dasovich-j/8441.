Enron Broadband's Indian CEO Sanjay Bhatnagar Resigns
1/23/1 3:58 (New York)


     Mumbai, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief
executive of Enron Broadband and the main architect of Enron's
Dabhol power project in India, has resigned.
     Bhatnagar was transferred to Enron Broadband, a unit of the
world's biggest energy trader, in November from chief executive of
Enron India Ltd., which set up a 740-megawatt power plant in
India's western Maharashtra state. Enron Broadband is setting up
an Internet data center in Mumbai and plans to sell connections to
the Web through optic fiber cables.
     ``He had transferred over to another of Enron's businesses
several months ago, so the transition at Enron India has already
been accomplished,'' a company statement said.
     Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power company, has invested $3
billion in the 740 megawatts a year project and its success could
influence further overseas investment in the industry.
     Enron, one of the first big foreign companies to enter the
country after India opened up the economy to foreign investors,
saw construction of the power plant delayed until December 1996
because of legal battles with local governments for three years.
     Sanjay Bhatnagar joined Enron Corp. 1992.
