Based upon comments from Jim and Tom, I have revised the attached schedule to 
show the percentage change in prices as well as adding the rates for ComEd 
and ConEd.  This is the most recent data I have available.  I could go to the 
tariffs for more current data but I would be a little concerned with 
consistentcy of comparison.  Let me know what you think.
