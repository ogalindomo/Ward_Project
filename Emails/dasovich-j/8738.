Hey Guys,

Just sat down to read about the first write up that is due
this Thursday, and realized that this is supposed to be a
group assignment!!  Ooops - I had no idea... Did you ;-)
Anyone read the case and/or taken a crack at it? Should
we try and co-ordinate a conference call?

Carolyn is out for the week and excused from the
assignment - just had a baby girl last Fri!!
Jeff, did you hear from teacher if OK to join ?
