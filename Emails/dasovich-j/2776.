Subject: Some good news




Steve Larson has accepted our invitation to be a panelist. Steve is the
current Executive Director of the California Energy Commission, and before
that he was the Chief of Staff to Steve Peace in the California Legislature.
So while we do not have an actual legislator, we have a very close close
substitute whose current position makes him even more attractive.

Cheers,
Lee
