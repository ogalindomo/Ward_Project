Attached is an edited version of the letter.  The file is entitled "DBSR
Redline of ltr to governor--options llist.doc".  It is not a real redline,
as we use Word Perfect and I do not know how to redline in Word.  Instead,
deletions are struck through, and additions are in bold font.  (The original
also has some bold font, but mostly in the headings; I think the additions
will be readily identified.)

I will be at the meeting but wanted to send this out ahead of time for
review by those who have the chance to review before the meeting.

We may have some subsantive issues in a couple of areas that I would rather
discuss in person; I am working to determine whether they really exist.

Dan Carroll

Subject: Draft letter to Governor Davis


Based on a reading of various official reports and our discussion last week,
the attached draft letter attempts to capture a consensus on immediate term
strategies for dealing with the overall electrical energy situation. We
relied upon the ISO Action Plan for plans for generation and transmission.
We will look forward to your input at tomorrow's meeting as to whether these
items are on target or not. If for some reason you and/or your organization
can not attend our meeting please call, fax or email us your comments and
suggestions as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

As a reminder we will be meeting tomorrow at 1:30 at the California
Chamber -- 1215 K Street, 14th Floor.
