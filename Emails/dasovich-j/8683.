Hey gang.

Here is my stab at things.  I added to Mark's written answers.  I hope that
Mark can incorporate them.  I forgot to bring Mark's spreadsheet home so I
put some things on the originals.  Hopefully it will be useful.

Whewww, it must have taken me 5-10 hours (wink, wink).  I have the project
management class tomorrow so I will not be around.  I will be home most of
Sunday.  My home phone number is 925-362-0210.
