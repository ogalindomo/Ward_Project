Attached please find a revised Solutions Document.  Also attached is a 
timeline I thought we should consider including.

It still needs the following:

1. Language on gas infrastructure (Jeff will develop)
2. Updated table on undercollection, etc. (Robert will work with MRW)
3. Data on core/non-core retail costs for June 2001 to incorporate in table 
(Robert will request fromTamara)

***I will be out of the office tomorrow, but will have my computer (or try my 
cell phone - 832.483.0624) and will be expecting to work on this to finish 
it.  I will check in with you all tomorrow morning.****

Thanks, 

Jennifer
