Classmates,

I am looking for contacts/collaborators interested in the Indian technology
market.

My job this summer is to research the Indian tech market for an investment
bank (www.broadview.com) .  I will be visiting India in July to meet with
VCs, Investment banks, technology firms and regulators.

If you happen to know people in the business (in India or in the US) who
would be interested in collaborating with or talking to me, I would
appreciate their contact info.

Thanks a bunch,

Siddharth

(sorry for the spam)
