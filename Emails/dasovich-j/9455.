Ken:

Jim Steffes, Janel Guerrero and I met earlier this morning to discuss what we 
think should be our messaging priorities for the one page fact sheets:

Buy Books, Not the Grid
A.    Use info on magnitude of $ needed to own/operate system
B. Use WOPPS and InterMountain pieces to illustrate problems with public 
ownership

2.    Use the Mirant v. CAISO piece to illustrate why Enron is attacking the 
situation in CA 

3.    Enron Solutions, i.e The Big Message

A.  Demand Buy Down
B.  MRW Study

4.    How Big The Blackout in Summer '01 will be
A.  Use data from Mary Schoen's email


I will email you a few additional things that might prove helpful.  Let me 
know if you need anything, and we'll talk further at 11:30 PST

Thanks
