Guillermo Canovas has joined Govt Affairs from Enron's Argentina office.  He 
has experience in working with the Argentine gas regulator for 5 years and 
with
 Enron for almost 3 years on gas open access issues.  I have talked with 
Becky about having him help in our gas group.  Jeff -- he can also help you 
as necessary.  Becky is going to provide him some information on the gas 
structure in the US.  Thanks.
