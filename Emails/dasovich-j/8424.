Jim - ORA has made a filing with the CPUC to amend the tariff provisions 
applicable to diversions so that the utility would not have to pay such high 
prices for diverting gas, and reducing some of the penalties as well.  Jeff 
Dasovich and I have been emailing each other on this, and it is probably a 
good idea for us to file something in response to the ORA request.  No one 
has yet talked to Mike Day about this, but I will call him and ask him to 
draft a response for us, if that is okay with you.  It may be that diversions 
are less likely in light of the DOE order, but perhaps it is better to 
protect ourselves.  What say you.
