Dear Haas Community,

Sunday Sep 10th, 2000 between 0600 and noon several Haas  servers will be
shut down for planned  maintenance and upgrades.  Servers will include
the  SQL database server, hcssql1,  and several other servers for brief
periods of time

Services affected will be access to SQL databases including the EDULINK
services (Career Services, Admissions and Registration), Reserve, Event
Center, and Helpdesk.   Other NT servers may be down for  two to three
minute outages for maintenance reboots.

Email services should not be affected, nor should research computing
services on Grady.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
