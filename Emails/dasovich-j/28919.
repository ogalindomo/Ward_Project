Good evening:

The Assembly just adjourned for the evening.  Session will reconvene at 9:30
am tomorrow.  None of the Budget trailer bills were taken up this evening.

AB 82xx (Keeley) passed out of Appropriations tonight.  Assemblyman Wrights
bill was amended into AB 50xx.  It passed out of policy but has not been
referred to Appropriations.  If you have any questions, please call me in
the morning.
