 During the last 8 weeks Lamar has notified you of some math errors in the
answer sets.  I have now posted corrected versions at the class web site
that contain the corrections Lamar has already informed you of.   These are
marked "revised". The revised answers are as follows:

AS3  5i
AS5 5c, 5f, 6b
AS7 4f, 4g

PS3  5f has also been changed to match the answer previously given.

No new concepts, theories, or applications are presented in any of these
revisions.
