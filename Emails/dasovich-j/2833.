That's right, we're already into the second week of the HaasWeek Survivor
Contest!  One contestant has been voted off of the island.  Read HaasWeek to
find out who - I don't want to give it away here and cut into our
circulation revenues.  Wait a minute, we give HW away for free.  Well, read
it anyway.

Another contestant won the first immunity challenge last weekend: Wendy
Hsu's costume was rated the best of the HW Survivor Contestants at last
Friday's Halloween Ball - Wendy pulled off a very convincing Velma from the
Scooby-Doo gang.  Congratulations, Wendy - you can breathe easy this week
and watch your opponents squirm!  And congrats to the other contestants,
whose costumes were fantastic as well.

So, now it's time to vote again to deny another poor soul from winning the
digital camera!  To vote, simple go to www.haasweek.net and click the
appropriate link - it couldn't be easier!  Polls are open until Wednesday at
5:00pm, so be sure to make your voice heard before it's too late!

Thanks,
HaasWeek
