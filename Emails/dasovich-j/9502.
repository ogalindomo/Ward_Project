Attached is a draft of the brief  in Phase I of the Rate stabilization
proceeding. It focuses solely on the issues of TURN's accounting proposal
(TRA/TCBA netting) and the status of the end of the rate freeze. Please
forward the brief to anybody not on the distribution list who you think
should review it.  The hearings are still ongoing and, at minimum, will
extend through Thursday.  Given that fact the ALJ has granted an extension
on the brief due date from Friday (the 2nd) until noon on Monday (5th).  My
thought is to have you all read through it and then perhaps have a
conference call on Friday so you can give me feedback.
