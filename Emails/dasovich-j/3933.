The CEC receives approximately $62 million a year  from he public goods 
charge for RDD.? The area of focus include: (1)  RDD that advance science and 
technology, (2) RDD activities not adequately  provided by competitive and 
regulated markets, (3) in-state (ie. California)  benefits, and (4) which are 
energy related that impact end-use efficiency,  environmentally preferred 
advance generation technologies, renewable  technologies, and other strategic 
research.
?
The CEC is reconvening its Public Interest Energy Research (PIER) Advisory  
Committee.? As an advisory committee member, I on behalf of IEP, have a  
unique opportunity to integrate into the PIER planning process research 
ideas,  concepts, etc. that could potentially?benefit our industry.? For  
example, during past PIER Advisory Committee meetings I urged them to pursue  
technologies that would help predict when wind speeds, volumnes, etc. to 
assist  intermittent wind technologies in scheduling.? This concept grew into 
a  signficant CEC grant to conduct this type of research.
?
If you have ideas for public interest RDD that you wish to share, please  
draft a brief statement of the idea, how/why it would help, etc., and email 
it  back to me.? I will attempt to pursue them at the CEC for funding.?
