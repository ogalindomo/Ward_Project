Subject: Budgets

Note that I missed a decimal point or two in our budget entry under 
California Coalitions for WPTF.  The entry provided in the proposed budget 
was $1,500.  The real amount should be $15,000.  

Also attached is the list of proceedings you asked that we prepare for 
illustrative purposes.
