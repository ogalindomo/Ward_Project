Senator seeks $2 billion to stabilize power rates
?
The state legislator who pushed for deregulation of the state's  energy
industry now wants to set aside $2 billion in state funds to  help
prevent the same kind of skyrocketing utility bills that have  plagued
the San Diego area, the first California region to be deregulated.  
The money could be used for any number of endeavors,  including
construction of state-run power plants, purchase of existing  privately
owned power plants or the takeover of the transmission system  for
energy in California, said Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman  of
the powerful Senate Budget Committee.

State contradicts power concerns
?
Contradicting months of dire warnings from energy suppliers,  state
officials Monday said California should have enough electricity  to
meet next summer's demands.? While stressing that new power  plants
still will be needed in the near future, California Energy  Commission
officials said the threat of blackouts and severe cutbacks next  summer
now seem unlikely.
