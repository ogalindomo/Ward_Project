thanks.  We just an improperly issued subpoena filed against us (ENA and EES) 
in the California gas complaint at FERC, sought by our good friends SCE.  
They ignored the folks on the service list and sent it to Jim Keller and 
Christian Yoder.  So now we are supposed to send them all kinds of pricing 
info ASAP.  We will be fighting this one on Monday, and also working on 
coming up with something for the Hearing Examiner on the 3 cent case, who 
wants Enron's summer electric on peak pricing forecasts.  Things are getting 
out of control!!

Harry: You clearly did a fantastic job, particularly under the circumstances 
described by Leslie.  Thanks a million for your help--we really needed 
it--and you managed to leave with your credibility intact, to boot.

And thanks. too, to Leslie.  The EES piece of the California puzzle is 
extremely challenging (as you know) and your and Harry's efforts are greatly 
appreciated.  I can cover the hearings on Monday and Tuesday.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
