Jennifer Thome will be coordinating the review of CDWR's contracts beginning 
this morning.  If anyone has any issues that need to be considered in the 
review, please make sure that Jennifer understands the issues.

Jennifer Fraser has volunteered someone from her team to help.  

We will be working with ENA Legal in Portland (through Alan Comnes) to help 
with the review.

Please call Jennifer Thome if there are any questions.  Jennifer will provide 
an update on timing etc. at the end of the day.

Thanks,

Jim
