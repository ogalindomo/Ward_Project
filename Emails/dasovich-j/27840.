		 Subject: PUC Agenda call recap


> According to the PUC:
> 
> Direct access will not be voted on tomorrow: The Treasurer, Department of
> Finance and the DWR have put out a memo regarding the parameters necessary
> for bonds to be issued directly. Commissioner Wood will be issuing a draft
> decision later this week that addresses these parameters.
(We should try to locate these documents - AReMers, can you work with your
PUC contacts to get a copy of the DOF/DWR memo?)

PUC Quote: "The commission is aware of legislative efforts to address direct
access. We do not intend to get ahead of these legislative efforts...the PUC
is operating in parallel with the Legislature."
