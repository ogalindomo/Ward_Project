Dear E204-1, E204-2 Students,
Since Saturday seemed to be the best time for students to attend another
review/discussion
session, I will hold a review on Saturday, May 13, in the afternoon
(approx. 1:30 PM).  I will have
to arrange for a room and will be more definite about the time next
week.  Unfortunately, I have
a time conflict in the morning, otherwise I suspect that would be
preferable.  I think we can get
the session videotaped, however.
