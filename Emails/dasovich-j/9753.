Jeff, I am too simple to understand this!  What does removing the direct 
access language do? I do not recognise the document from which it was removed 
, hence I do not know whether this is bad or good for Enron! However from 
your last statement - ' has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition' - I am interpreting   that the implementation of the  Direct 
Access prohibition is no longer on anyones agenda so that would be good for 
Enron. 
Hope you are still having fun!

The Commission just voted out one half of the "Bilas Alternate."

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of 
arrogance."  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff
