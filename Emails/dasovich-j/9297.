Attached is  a draft of comments addressing the draft decision issued
yesterday dealing with direct access suspension.  I have drafted it such
that it says that we think the Commission does not need to deal with this
now, but if it does, then it should make clear that direct access is not
suspended until the final order on the issue is released.

I would like to get this in as early as possible as the commission is voting
on the order tomorrow and all changes to a draft decision have to go through
a vetting process.

I am in hearings today so please send all comments to Jim McTarnaghan.
