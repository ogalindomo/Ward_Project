> Dear Jeff
> I am Organizing a Panel at the IEEE Summer Meeting in Vancouver July 15-19
> on the California electricity crisis: cause, remedies and prevention. The
> idea is to have different perspectives e.g. operations, market power,
demand
> side response, supply, regulatory etc. I would like to invite you to take
> part in this panel. As someone that was intimately involved in the
> restructuring you could provide an invaluable regulatory and political
> perspective on how did we get into this and how can we get out. At this
> point I have commitments from Fluckiger of the CAISO, Ed Kahn, Ward
Uggerud
> CEO of Otter Tail Power Company, Gary Ackermann, Executive
Director-Western
> Power Trading Forum and I am waiting for a commitment from Vikram Budraja.
