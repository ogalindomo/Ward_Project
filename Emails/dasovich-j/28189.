Jeff,

The subtrans rate has no distribuiton in it (by definition) and T is small so 
that rate is essentially the gen component for all the TOU rates.  Unless the 
CPUC has reached new hights of insanity, the gen component shoudl be about 
the same ($100/MWh) for all the retail rates shown.

Hope this is what you were after.

Alan
