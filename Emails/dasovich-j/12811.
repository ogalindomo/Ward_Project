Hi Evening MBA students,

We expect to send out grade letters next week, the last week in May.  We
are receiving grades from the instructors this week, but cannot e-mail,
fax, nor tell you on the phone your grades.

Some of your grades my already be available on Bearfacts, if they were
submitted electronically by the instructor.

Try using "password" as the password or your PIN# when you first go into
Bearfacts.  If you have questions, please give us a call at (510) 642-1406.

Thanks,
TJ
