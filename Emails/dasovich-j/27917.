		 Subject: Assessment of rate impacts of undercollection


Jeff and Alan,

Attached is a memo that presents the results of our assessment. I will be
sending a spreadsheet along in a few minutes that was used to develop the
estimates in the memo.

Please give me a call if you have any questions about this memo.
