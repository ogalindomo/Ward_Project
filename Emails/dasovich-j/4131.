On Monday, November 27, the Arizona Superior Court issued a judgment to CV 
97-03748 (consolidated) TEP vs. ACC.  The judgment  is against the Arizona 
Corporation Commission on all consolidated rules and CC&N complaints filed by 
the coops and pertaining to all CC&N decisions insofar as the Commission's 
Electric Competition Rules and Decisions enacted and issued pursuant to those 
rules are invalid for failure to provide for the Commission ascertaining the 
fair value of the property of public service corporations under Article 15& 
14 of the Arizona Constitution and certain rules are invalid for lack of 
Attorney General certification.

It was further ordered that the coops demonstrated as a matter of law that 
the Commission's rules and CC&N decisions are unlawful and unconstitutional 
under the Arizona Constitution.  Commission Decisions 59942, 61071(Emergency 
Rules), 61272 (Emergency Rules made permanent) and 61969 and all Electric 
Competition Rules enacted under those decisions are vacated and set aside as 
unlawful and unconstitutional.  All competitive CC&N's and tariffs approved 
under those decisions are also vacated and set aside as unlawful and 
unconstitutional.
