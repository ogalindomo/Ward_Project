Tom Hoatson has a new cell phone number now.  He asked that you let the group 
know.
#973-951-1770

Also, as you can see I finally have email now.  If you could replace Sharon 
Eley's email address with mine that would be appreciated.  Everything else is 
the same; location, phone number, extension, etc.  Again, I am the new Admin 
Asst. directly reporting to Frank Rishe but also taking care of Tom Hoatson 
and Dan Staines.  Thank you!
