> "I am going to will my way to a solution that is financially viable and
within the existing rate structure....'Leadership' means raise rates....
'Bold' means raise rates. 'Decisive' means raise rates. Everything means
raise rates. That makes everyone on Wall Street happy. It does nothing to
solve our problem."

in the Jan. 21 Los Angeles Times.

> "[S]ome rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy
strong. ... Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more.
For the rest, the average increase will be 26 and a half percent. For many
of that group, rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users
will see their rates rise 34 and a half percent on average. That includes
business paying their share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge
we've all been paying since last winter."
