I had a conversation with Steve Bowen, Blumenfeld and Cohen, with regard to
our retainer arrangement.  We have never formalized the arrangement with
Steve and have discussed working on a project basis going forward.  Steve
has been assisting us with our CLEC license status in California and
investigating interconnection work in Nevada and California.

Since we do not have a formal retainer arrangment in place, I would ask
that EBS GA direct general questions to Dan Clearfield, but please let me
know if you are asking Dan to investigate issues for you so that we can
manage our retainer arrangement w/ Dan.  Also anything that we ask Steve
Bowen to do for us will require an RCR.  Thanks.
