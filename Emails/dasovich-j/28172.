Thanks to Delaney's efforts, attached are the redline and clean drafts
from today's discussions.

The changes reflect the discussions among those groups attending today's
negotiation.  With TURN absent, we sorted through the issues to the best
of our ability, but recognize that the draft does not reflect TURN's
comments.  Mike and Lenny, please note particularly that we deleted the
"flag" on recharacterizing the DRC payment through 2002 for under 20 kW
customers since we had not yet received proposed language from you.  We
will  include the language tomorrow if it is available.
