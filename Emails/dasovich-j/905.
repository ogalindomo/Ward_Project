U.S. lawmakers should give federal regulators more authority to help right 
the shaky electricity industry restructuring process, according to a former

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and not individual state agencies, 
should oversee the siting process for new power plants and interstate 
transmission line developments, former U.S. Rep Phil Sharp, an Indiana 
Democrat, said Tuesday at a Chicago conference.
