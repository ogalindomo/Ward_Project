Subject: Conference call re Tim's top 5

I'd like to have a conference call tommorrow at 9:00 a.m. to review Tim's 
"top 5" priorities to fix the wholesale market in California.  I need to do 
this tomorrow so Seabron and Ron can write our pleading for the Section 206 
proceeding while I'm on vacation next week.  Please let me know ASAP if 9:00 
is a bad time or if you don't want to be on the call.
