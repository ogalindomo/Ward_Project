CA: Activist Pushing Ballot Initiative To Reverse State Utilities> 
Deregulation
????Nov. 29, 2000 - The Wall Street Journal (11/29, Smith) reported, "Harvey 
Rosenfield, a consumer activist who has made a career of tapping public anger 
at corporate interests, is drafting a ballot initiative aimed at reversing <
electricity> deregulation in California. While Mr. Rosenfield has a mixed 
record of success with voters, his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has 
focused public attention on such issues as rising auto-insurance rates and 
quality of care at health maintenance organizations and helped bring about 
change." Rosenfield "now expects to tap into widespread indignation over 
soaring <electricity costs and impatience with regulators who can't agree 
about what is to be done. To get his initiative on the 2002 ballot, Mr. 
Rosenfield needs roughly 700,000 signatures on a petition, which he is 
expected to accomplish. Mr. Rosenfield also is expected to raise $7 million 
for his campaign; he has been able to raise money in the past through 
direct-mail solicitations."
