Attached is my version of 1st session for Air Conf..  Sending to Barr and
Dasovitch for direct response to Pat and Linda at the above email addresses.
I am traveling until next Tuesday.  Email is questionable.

Linda -- You can call Geesman (he said yes to me).  I know you have talked
to Karen; I will squeeze her to make sure and will let you know.  KM
