As you can see from the list of names above, it's going to be a WILD time on 
the Whirlpool Golf course in Niagara-on-the-lake.  We have decided that a 
"golf scramble format" be played for the Enron group, and in order to put 
teams together we need to know a few things such as:

Handicap or lowest recorded score and (be honest)
How often do you play (# of times in a month)

Please forward this information to me by close of business on Tuesday, May 30.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.
