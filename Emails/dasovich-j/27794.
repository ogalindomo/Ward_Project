Please SAVE THE DATE for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group's Annual
Planning Conference, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, October 4 and 5, in
Half Moon Bay.

As you know, each year the SVMG Planning Conference allows all Liaison
Representatives, Committee Chairs and Committee Members a chance to look
back at the current year to evaluate our performance, and to look forward at
the next three years to prepare a rolling three-year business plan.  In
addition, we invite in key guests to speak with us about the pressing issues
facing our region and state.

YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THIS YEAR'S PLANNING CONFERENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I
truly hope you will join us, and we will follow-up with more details soon.
Last year, 60 Member Company representatives participated in this important
event, and their collective effort has helped make this year one of the most
successful in SVMG's history.  With your help, next year can be even better.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  Please let me know if you have
any questions.

Sincerely,

Carl Guardino
