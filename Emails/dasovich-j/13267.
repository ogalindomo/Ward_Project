If you are not familiar with AB 36 (Steinberg) and  SB 11 (Escutia), they 
deal with protective orders and limit the use of  them.? These bills are a 
top priority of the business community to  defeat.? Right now, they apply to 
cases of financial fraud, environmental  hazard, product liability, and 
unfair insurance practices.
However, please be aware that the plaintiffs' bar  is planning to amend the 
bills to also apply to energy practices by  generators.
AB 36 is on the Assembly Floor; SB 11 is pending on  the Senate Floor.
