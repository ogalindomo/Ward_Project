Sorry we missed last night. I was expecting to see you at the dinner. I
should like to visit the office if there is time. My constraints today are
lecture at Berkeley 12.30 to 2pm, and they suggest I should be there around
11.30 beforehand. Also a request to meet someone from STG consulting, with
whom I am doing some work, probably in Menlo Park, and an invitation to
dinner in Berkeley area. I had thought we might meet this morning before the
lecture, but probably too late now. Could do afterwards, en route to Menlo
Park? I am at Claremont Hotel until around 11.15, tel 510 843 3000 room 325.
Am in Business Centre on Hotmail at present but computer's a bit slow here.
Regards
Stephen
