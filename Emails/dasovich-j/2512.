You probably recall that the PX filed for $350 price caps on demand and  
supply bids in the day-ahead and day-of markets back in August.
?
FERC has requested the PX file additional information with regard to:
?
1.? Any empirical data available that demonstrates that the absence of  the 
requested maximum price on Demand and Supply Bids has resulted in market  
distortions.
2.? Any empirical data available that demonstrates that in certain  hours the 
PX prices have not been disciplined by the ISO price caps; and
3.? Any empirical data available that demonstrates that the ISO  real-time 
market and the PX day-ahead and day-of markets do not operate in an  
inter-related manner.
?
The request was issued on 10/5, although I just received it, and the  
response is due tomorrow.
