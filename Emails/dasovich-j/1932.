Jeff, Heather has started work on a draft program, and I've emailed her to
ask if it's something we could shoot over to you. Mike Florio from TURN has
accepted our invitation, so we will have a consumer advocate at the table.
We're asking Diane Feinstein to give a brief opening keynote. I wish we had
more confirmations as of today, but I think all of our hard work is paying
off: The speaker group is getting pretty impressive already (e.g Lynch,
Littlechild, Tyson, Harris), and I'm confident that we will have several top
private sector CEOs as well. The conference will be an excellent one; we'll
keep plugging away to meet all of our goals for it.
I'll keep you posted, and let me know if there's anything else I can do to
help at your end. Thanks for all of your help in getting this going.

Lee

Thanks, Lee.  Is there a firmed-up agenda yet?  If so, could you forward to
me?
