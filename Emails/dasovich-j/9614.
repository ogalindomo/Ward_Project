We had a number of conversations today about our daily calls.  Here's what 
was agreed:

1. We need to keep the calls brief .  

2. We will use the call for discussion of strategy, resource needs and 
assignments.  We will use the collective voicemail system and website for 
updates on discussions and other events that are germane to the California 
crisis.  

3. To that end, the following will be our agenda for the daily calls:

Brief legislative report from the Sacramento team.
Discussion of any significant changes re:  political or PR strategy.
Questions on report or strategy.

(The Sacramento Team can exit the call at this point).

Resource needs (fact sheets, analysis, etc.)
Summation--(assignments, etc.)

4. To keep the calls organized and on point, we will also have a chairman for 
each call as follows:

Rick (if he is on the call.)
Jim S. (if Rick is not on the call)
Paul K. (if Rick and Jim are not on the call).

Thanks.
