Sorry.  I sorta had a brain fart.  I'd forgotten the San Diego "firm" 
problem.  Mark sent me a note and reminded me what preciptated the opening of 
the proceeding.  I guess the real question is what will the CPUC do to go 
forward?  How will it combine the investigation with the information it 
picked up at the workshop?

Are you planning on going to the prehearing conference on May 17?  You got 
tIme to go down and drink some Starbucks tomorrow?
