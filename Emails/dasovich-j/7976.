We've been out of town for a few days so I don't know if you'll be getting
this OK.  We'll be back tomorrow and I'll re-send the results.  If you do
get this and you want to start looking toward the playoffs, put points on
the four games coming up this weekend.  There are eleven games in the
playoff period, including the Superbowl game, so you have from fifteen
points down to five points to put on any one game, uot using the same number
of points more than once.  The whole playoff series is treated as one week
of games, so we won't know the winners until the end of the Superbowl game.
The winning amounts were outlined to you before the season started, but
since I am now working on another computer I can't tell you what they are
until tomorrow
