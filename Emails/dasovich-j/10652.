Attached is the list of influential contacts in the key legislative districts 
we've identified.  I've made the following assignments:
 Burton -- Jeff
 Bowen - Paul
 Hertzberg - Sue (since these businesses are in the San Fernando Valley, they 
probably heard you speak at VICA last week -- or they might have heard OF 
you!)
 Keeley - Jim
 Cox - Sandi (since the three contacts are in Sacramento)

The names with an asterisk received the package from Ken Lay on Tuesday.  
I've also attached the message points we gave to Ken.

Please let me know if you get any feedback.  Thanks for helping out and 
making these calls.
