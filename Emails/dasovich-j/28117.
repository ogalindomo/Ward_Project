SVMG Energy Committee Members and Liaison Representatives:

The CEC recently launched the Innovative Peak Load Reduction
Program which provides grants for reducing peak electrical demand.
Supporting the SVMG Energy Policy,  this program will pay up to $250
per kW, and up to 75% of the costs for projects that achieve load
reduction between the hours of 2:00PM-6:00PM, June through
September.  Attached is a flyer that gives an overview of the
program and the scheduled seminars that explain the grant program.

A seminar is being conducted on Tuesday, June 26, at the San
Francisco Airport Holiday Inn to explain the program and the
application process.  There is no charge for the seminar and a full
complementary breakfast will be provided.  The seminar starts at
7:00AM and is about an hour.

Take advantage of this opportunity to get a state grant to help defer
the cost of energy efficiency projects.

Thank you for your consideration.
