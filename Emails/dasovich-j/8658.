When the folks in Berkeley have a chance, I'd appreciate the "final" file
that was released to the press, plus the final list of endorsements.   I
have the versions you sent out yesterday, but I assume that any typos, etc
were corrected and that the list of endorsements changed from yesterday.

Thanks for all the efforts back there.
