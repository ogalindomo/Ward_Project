Here are my comments and additions. This swap case is a very popular one since
it was the first known interest rate swap and one I've studied before.

OK gang,

Here is a draft of the memo.  I extended my analysis to try and quantify
limiting conditions for partners on a and x.  The problem is that with my
estimates even using the lower limits the deal will never be profitable for
BF Goodrich.  Please check my math, I know I must have made an error.

Anyway, I hope that we can possibly talk about it at break tomorrow.
