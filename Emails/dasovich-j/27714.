Jeff:  I am going to be in San Fran at the end of this month (June 25-27) for 
a "Energy Infrastructure Crisis in the West" conference (see

At one point, we had talked about trying to meet with Mike Zenker who heads 
up the CERA office there (in Oakland).   I could try to come there earlier in 
the day than planned if you still think it would be a good idea for us to 
meet him.   What do you think?
