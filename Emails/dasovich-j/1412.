Western Government Affairs --

Here is the outline of the Upcoming Issues by Forum we put together recently 
in DC.  We need to make sure that we have everything on this list (or add as 
appropriate).  Of course, this list will continue to evolve - I added the Cal 
ISO request to buy "forward" on the list.

Gavin Dillingham has agreed to maintain a calendar that will track all of 
these Issues and Important Dates.  Our goal is to have a calendar program 
that everyone can access to keep on top of what is going on related to 
California and the West.

Please let me know if you have any thoughts on this.  

Jim
