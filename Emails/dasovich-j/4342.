Jeff and Ralph:
?
In lieu of trying to set up another conference  call, why don't the two of 
you, Pat and I try to have a few words Sunday  evening, prior to the 
conference.
?
Ralph:? you have expressed preference to  follow Jeff?? That makes sense to 
me,? given the agenda.
Jeff, you willl probably be discussing the question  on new, more efficient 
energy generation;? my guess is that Ralph will be  speaking more time on 
renewable energy sources
?
The point of this session, really, is to follow on  the education sessions of 
8:00-10am,? with some creative ideas about what  can be done NOW.? Your 
session and the following one re: credits?will  hopefully produce some 
thoughts can that be returned to and discussed further in  the context of the 
subsequent?topics.? As Pat and I talk with other  presenters and responders, 
it is?seeming to me that?the best hope for  solving the?problem in the short 
range (next two summers) will be the kind  of ideas that hopefully will?come 
out of your session and the following  one.
?
See you?next week, and thanks for agreeing to  present.
?
Linda Wilson?
