Jeff, we are working on getting a guarantee.  The finance folks favor a 
guarantee from EBS.  Is that OK or do we need Enron Corp.?  Also, I am not 
sure how quickly this can be done.  Is there a problem if we don't file until 
next week some time?   Thanks.

Subject: Corporate Guarantee for ETI filing in California

Greetings Steve and Robin:

One requirement for ETI's filing in California (which we'll hopefully submit 
Friday or Monday) is a bank letter confirming $100K in liquid assets.  An 
alternative available to us, which we all decided is preferable, is a 
corporate guarantee.  Has that been cobbled together yet?  Is there anything 
you need me to do to help pull it together?  If so, just holler and I'll be 
glad to help.  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff
