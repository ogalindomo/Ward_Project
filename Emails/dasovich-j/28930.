Or, what's left of the summer...

We have our annual week in the wilderness the week of August 20 (in the past, 
we've gone in mid-July) -- the Legislature may be active then or maybe not, 
but I wanted you all to be aware of my plans.

Other than that week, I plan to take a few days off here and there as my 
schedule permits.
