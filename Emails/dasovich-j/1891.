Computer tips and hints:

Laptop Slices:  For those of you with Compaq 3500 and M300 laptops:   The 
bottom piece of your laptop is called a "slice".  This slice should never be 
separated from or attached to the top-half while the laptop is on.

You should also not dock or undock any kind of laptop while it is on.  Please 
shutdown your laptop before docking or undocking.

Slow Processing:  Many of you may have experienced a slowing down of 
processing speed while using the internet or when trying to save a document.  
This slow down is due to a Microsoft auto-save program which cannot be 
removed.  I have attached a batch file that was provided by the migration 
team.  Please detach this program to your desktop and run  it daily (or 
whenever you experience slow processing times).  To launch and run the 
program, double-click on the icon - that's all you need to do.  




Thanks and I hope you found these tips helpful.  Look for future emails on
