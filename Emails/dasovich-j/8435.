I'd suggest keeping the distinction b/w what the membership is doing ("our
members are investing ...") and what IEP is doing.  There's a couple of
lines that muddle the distinction and make it sound like the association is
building things.  ABB

Subject: IEP Ad Copy for March California Journal


Greetings:
In all of the craziness this morning with getting items out I neglected to
attach the below Ad copy for the March California Journal.  This is just the
copy and as soon as it is approved we will send out the full ad copy with
graphics.  Please review this and keeping with our 48-hour review period
please send any comments back to me by 9:00 a.m. PST on Thursday, January
25, 2001. Thank you for taking the time to review this.  Please let me know
if you have any questions.


Under Construction  [headline]

No major power plants have been built in California for the past ten years.
While population has increased 16% and the peak demand for electricity has
Surged 15% (33% in Silicon Valley), power generation has inched up only 2%.

But things are changing.

Our member companies have already invested billions of dollars to buy and
modernize California's vintage power plants, many of which date back to the
Korean War. We're spending billions more to build new plants. (Six are
already under construction. Three more have been approved.  Eleven more are
under review.)

Instead of risking tax money, we're using private-sector dollars to build
and run our plants - to power California's economy into the future with
clean, reliable and affordable electricity.

We're part of the solution.
