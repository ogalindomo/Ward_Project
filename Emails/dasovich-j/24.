Congratulations to 2 new weekly winners and our first repeat:  JAM took 1st
for the week and Prentice was 3rd.  Nancy had her second weekly win, placing
2nd.

Barrie maintains her rookie of the year honors even though she had a very
bad week, and Donna who ended in last place last year is now in 6th place.

Big ranking swaps - JAM went from 14th to a tie for 3rd and Prentice went
from 11th to a tie for 3rd.  The bottom 5 remained unchanged -

Week 3 results are on the Week #3 tab.  Cumulative payouts are on the Payout
