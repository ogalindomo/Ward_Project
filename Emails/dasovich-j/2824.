IEP has scheduled a Restructuring/Transmission Task  Force meeting for 9:30 
a.m. on Friday, Nov. 3.? The meeting will be held  here at IEP.? While we 
would prefer an in-person meeting, we will also  provide teleconferencing 
capabilities for those who would like to participate by  phone.
?
The purpose of the meeting will be to review and  discuss the draft IEP 
response to the various FERC filings addressing a  dysfunctional market in 
California and alledging generator/marketer market power  abuse.? As noted in 
our previous email, IEP is developing a response to  these FERC filings 
compatible to the work being accomplished by the Market  Response Project.? 
?
In addition to reviewing and discussing the draft  response, we will be 
discussing specific recommedations to the FERC/CPUC/EOB,  etc. to improve the 
functioning of the marketplace.? We will be circulating  prior to the meeting 
the latest thinking on this, and we expect to discuss in  detail the range of 
recommendations which might be inserted into the FERC  response filing.? This 
will be a followup to the IEP Board discussion on  Wednesday at IEP's Annual 
Meeting.
