Subject: Consumer Group Reports Issued


On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a 
report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured 
Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been 
manufactured by "energy firms."  A copy of the report is attached and is also 
available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org.

Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the 
Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility 
and Mismanagement of a Vital Service in a Vulnerable Market) asking 
policymakers to "rethink" the move toward retail electric competition.  A 
copy of the report is available at their website at www.consumerfed.org or 
www.consumerfed.org/calmkt.pdf.  Copies of the press release and the report 
are also attached.
