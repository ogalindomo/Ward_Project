We are part of a retail coaltion called ARM.  ARM has hired a PR Firm, 
Edelman.  At the first meeting today, one of Edelman's VPs mentioned that 
Nancy Vogle is preparing a BIG report on the current deregulation situation.  
She is excited about talking to some retailers.  We are in the process of 
putting our collective message points together, which I will pass along.  A 
few ARM members will then meet with Nancy in the next two weeks.  Will keep 
you apprised.
