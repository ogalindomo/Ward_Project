Thanks for the warning about Windows 2000 -- they want to get me back to 
Houston to switch me, too, and I'm sure it's terrible for remote workers. 
Everything always is.

Thanks for helping out with this piece -- I know we have to update to reflect 
SDG&E's new bilateral trade ability.

Take care,
Jeannie
