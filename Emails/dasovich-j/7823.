Friday's Bandwidth Market Report reported Global Photon's regulatory approval 
to build their 4-Tbps from San Diego to Morro Bay.
I'm thinking we still consider this company a small fry, but perhaps 
congratulations are in order  - your thoughts?
I do not have the business cards of the group we met with, but Jeff probably 
has their names and e-mails.

Thanks
Kimberly
