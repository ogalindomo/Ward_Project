CONTINUING STUDENTS:

From now until Friday, May 11 you will have an opportunity to add and drop
classes by e-mailing tj@haas.berkeley.edu.

(If you are satisfied with your schedule, you don't have to e-mail me.)

In your e-mail, please indicate the classes you want to add and
drop.  Other students may want to add your dropped classes and
we'd like to let them know in May, rather than in August.  On Monday, May
21, we will again confirm your Fall 2001 class schedule by e-mail.

Textbooks and readers will be ordered for you based on this confirmed 
schedule.

NO CHANGES TO SCHEDULES FROM MAY 12 - AUGUST 26.
