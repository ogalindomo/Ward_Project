Dear E204-1, E204-2 students,
The final exam date for E204-1 AND E204-2 has been set for:
 Wednesday, May 17
 6-9PM  (you should not require the full class time)
We were allocated an extra room on that day by scheduling.

Files for last week's simulation lecture can be found in the attachments
to this e-mail.

Good luck with the Team Assignment (due this week).
