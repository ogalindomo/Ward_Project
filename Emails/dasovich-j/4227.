Attached is a discussion agenda for tomorrow's CESG meeting at 10:00 at
the Chamber of Commerce.  Our objective for tomorrow is to move through
these and other issues you raise to outline a strawperson proposal for
forward contracting,  rate stabilization and TRA undercollections.  As
Ralph's email of Sunday evening observed,  if we manage to stay narrowly
focused on these issues in the short-run we may have an opportunity to
move the debate.
