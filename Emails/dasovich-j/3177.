As you are aware, PG&E and EESI is currently in dispute regarding the PX 
credits and resulting payments from PG&E to EESI.  I believe this issue is a 
sore subject for PG&E.  Can you please be vigilant with respect to the 
utility's Ex Parte communications, because I suspect PG&E will be raising the 
issue of PX credits resulting in utility payments to DA customers as a way of 
getting out of the rate freeze obligation.
