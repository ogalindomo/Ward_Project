Happy 2000 and welcome back to Haas.

The Haas Marketing and Communications Web Team is happy to present a new
web page for you. At
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/Webteam/setup.html, you'll find
information about the Haas web site and about maintaining your own Haas web
pages. Of particular interest may be the Haas "How do I?" web page at
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/Webteam/howdoi.html, directing
students, faculty members and staff members to various web development
resources. As with all web pages, this is a forever-growing module, so
watch for new additions as the year 2000 grows older.

Debra.
