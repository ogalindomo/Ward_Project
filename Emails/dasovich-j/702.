Here's the next draft of the FERC presentation.  I know this looks long, but 
if
you down load it and use the "Slide Show" mode, it will hide many of  slides
that will not be presented but will instead be provided, in hard copy, as
supporting information.  I realize there are formatting errors, but the basics
are now there.(See attached file: August 24 presentation to FERC1.ppt)
