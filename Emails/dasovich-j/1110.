Peggy, and all,

I did a first cut on a draft of regulatory/legislative risks associated with 
San Diego.  Because of the need for quick turn-around I am circulating the 
draft for comment.

If anyone has comments on the draft, please send to my attention asap and I 
will compile a final document.  Thanks.

Mona:
As we discusssed, I've attached the PR risks associated with going
back into San Diego.  Please email back your take on the regulatory
risks in the morning.
Thanks
