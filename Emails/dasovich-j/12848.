Jan will be setting up a call today to discuss EES' ability to pass the "3 
cent surcharge" through under its contracts.  Marty would like our advice on 
this today, so I hope you are available.  Thanks.  

P.S.  Vicki and Marty, please let Jan know if you wish to be included in the 
call or just want the result.
