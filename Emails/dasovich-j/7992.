As a follow up to my email from yesterday, responses to SoCalEd's Petition 
are due on Tuesday, January 2.  Dan Watkiss has spoken to the FERC attorneys 
who will be answering the Petition, and he is comfortable that FERC will be 
able to adequately defend FERC against the Petition.  Additionally, Sue Mara 
will contact IEP to see if they will be responding to the Petition, and I 
have a call in to EPSA to see if they will be responding.  Therefore, because 
the responses seem to be adequately covered, and to keep Enron's name out of 
the headlines, we do not plan on responding separately to the Petition.

If you have any comments or questions, please let us know.

		 Subject: SoCalEd Petition for a Writ of Mandamus

On December 26, SoCalEd filed a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus against FERC 
regarding FERC's December 15 order, asking the Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit to direct FERC to establish and order "just and reasonable cost-based 
rates" for sales in the California ISO and PX markets.  SoCal requests that 
the Court act by January 5.

SoCal argues that its lenders have said that unless FERC acts immediately to 
"restore creditor confidence" in SoCal's ability to repay its loans, that 
SoCal will not be able to access additional funding, so that by mid-January 
SoCal will be unable to buy electricity, resulting in rolling blackouts to 
its customers.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like a faxed copy of 
the petition.
