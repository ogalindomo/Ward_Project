Steve, not to get too wrapped up in a name, but I think Enron 
Telecommunications may be confusing.  Can we use something more innocuous 
like Enron Communications Ltd. or Enron Communications North America?  Just 
thinking out loud.

Robin, here is my understanding:

1.  It will be a owned by ECI.
2.  Conduct regulated telecommunications activities
3.  A corporation
4.  I suggest the name Enron Telecommunications, Inc.  or a variation using 
Telecommunications.

Subject: New ECI Company

I have a couple of preliminary questions regarding the formation of the new 
entity we need to form for ECI regulated transactions.

1) Do we know who is going to be the shareholder? (Enron Communications Group 
Inc. owns 100% of ECI)
2) I need a business purpose for the Authorization and Justification 
Memorandum which is required for all new entities.
3) Is this going to be a Corporation or a LLC?

I think it would be a good idea to put the same slate of officers and 
directors as we have in place for ECI.  This is just an attempt to get the 
ball rolling so if you could get back to me I would appreciate it.  

P.S. We will try to stay away from Enron Communications 2, Inc. for the 
name!  Please send me your suggestions!

Thanks
Robin Hill
