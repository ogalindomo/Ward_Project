Mary & Joe --

Given the time frame for our response (2 - 4 minutes), we need to prepare not 
only our "leave behind" but also our "oral message".  

I want to make sure that everyone agrees with the theme and content of our 
verbal discussions.  Can you please put out an outline of the message and 
details and then make sure the Trading desk and CA Govt Affairs agree with 
the form and delivery (set up a conference call if necessary)?  

This is a very complicated issue and very short time frame to deliver.  The 
more we prepare I think the better we'll do.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Edited Draft of FERC Presentation

Attached is new and improved version of the FERC presentation.  Delete the 
one I sent you yesterday.  Detach and play "slide show" to see the short 
version that would be used for the presentation.  The additional pages would 
be distributed in hard copy as a reference document.   The document includes 
a few minor corrections and spellchecks, formats, etc.
