Subject: Next meeting for GSPP/IBER/UCEI conference


 It looks like tomorrow, Wednesday 9/6, at 5:30 Eastern time/2:30 Pacific
works for most people.  Any objection?

 I will send around an agenda by tomorrow morning which includes the
progress of the GSPP alumni group to date.  I look forward to welcoming Carl 
and
Severin and speaking with all of you to nail down a list of speakers to begin
contacting.

 P.S. Coincidentally, I would highly recommend Carl's recent book
Information Rules as a new economy business strategy guide that even has some
relevance in what often appears as the old economy backwaters of the electric
industry.

ps
_sr_b_1_3/002-4543327-5556850.  The parallel of Carl and Severin's work to 
place
the popular mythologies of the electric industry and information economy into
tried-and-true economic principles is interesting.  That, in combination with
tried-and-true public policy methods will be a strong antidote to many of the
current political proposals.
