Please be advised that we have two videos for viewing this afternoon for 
whomever might be interested.  
One is entitled "Energy Crisis in California" from ABC's Nightline, broadcast 
Monday, June 4th, which runs approximately 20 minutes; and the other is 
"Blackout" from PBS' "Frontline", broadcast Tuesday, June 5th with a running 
time of approximately 55 minutes.

You are welcome to come by for a "screening" in the large conference room 
about 2:30!

Thanks,

Joseph
