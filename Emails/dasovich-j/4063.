Mike Day asked me to update my PG&E city-gate comparison to show, contrary
to the PD in the Gas OIR, that recent months have not called into question
the benefits of the PG&E city-gate market.  Attached is a figure with NGI
data from May through November for the PG&E city-gate and for Topock plus
Baja transport.  The city-gate is higher than Topock plus Baja only in
October, when the city-gate did not drop as quickly as Topock did in the
aftermath of the El Paso explosion.  I did not include the Malin plus
Redwood comparison, which has been consistently below the city-gate this
summer (Malin prices were consistently and significantly lower than Topock
this summer).  However, little Redwood capacity is available, so I would
argue that Malin plus Redwood is not an option for most end users.
