Be aware the the GA group in Houston will be receiving new Lotus Notes e-mail 
addresses this week.  Some changes have already taken place.  If you get an 
error message when you try to e-mail, you can look the person up under the 
CORP address book (almost all of the previous addresses were in the EES 
address book).  Call me if you have any questions.
