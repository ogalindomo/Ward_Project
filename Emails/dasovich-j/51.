Hi,

Several students have expressed interest in my holding additional
sessions on finding periodical articles using ABI/Inform and Dow Jones
interactive.

If you haven't attended one of these sessions and would like to do so,
please let me know which days/weeks are best for you. I'll then set up
something based on your response.

Thanks.

Sue the Librarian
