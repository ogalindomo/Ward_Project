Attached is a draft order circulated late this afternoon.  The intent of the
Commission is to vote on it at Thursday's meeting. The order implements the
provision in AB 1x to suspend direct access.  We are given 24 hours to
comment.  In addition note ordering paragraph six which gives parties 30
days to address how the Commission should implement the suspension of direct
access.

If you want to lob comments in tomorrow, please call me first thing in the
morning. ( I must leave for hearings at the Commission at 8:40).
