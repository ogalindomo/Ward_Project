Hi Continuing Evening MBA students,

The schedules may not have reached you clearly....

The information is there, yet transposed and I'll send out again on Monday.

Until then, if there is a number to the right of the class title, that is
your waitlist #.  If there is no #, then you are IN the class already.

I did mention waitlists in case you want to add any of these classes from
now on:

E210 Competitive Strategy
E252 Negotiations
E264 High Tech Marketing
E278 Deals
E291B-1 Speaking for Management
E295 Entrepreneurship
E296-2 Business Law

Thanks!
TJ
