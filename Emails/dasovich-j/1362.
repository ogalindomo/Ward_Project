Ladies & Gentlemen;

1.  FYI - See Chris' note below.

2.  Have we heard from our PG&E contact?  If so, when might we meet with them.

3.  Jeff - can you get us the name of the CFO at Sempra.  We want to set up a 
meeting to talk about core gas procurement outsourcing.

Guys,

Can we have a meeting/conf call later in the week - I would like to see and 
discuss the next presentation(s) for PG&E, SEMPRA.
