Jeff,
Your schedule must be loony, so rather than occupy your time
on the phone, I'll send two questions via email.
1). Are you attending the WPTF general mtg this wk in Phoenix?
If so I'll see you there. If not, let me know if can help you out there.
2). Who would you suggest I talk to regarding Govt Affairs staffing
opportunities in the West?  (that is, if such opps exist...)

Regards
Gary
