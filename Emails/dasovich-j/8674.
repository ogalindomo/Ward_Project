Hi, Jeff!

I've landed at Porter Novelli. I'm very happy -- it's a good move for me.
Reading about Enron in Tuesday's UT...geez!

I'll be traveling to SF quite frequently in the next couple of
months...think we can pull our schedules together to grab dinner one night?
I'd love to catch up...but if you get to SD, Jesse Knight is in the same
building. Kill two birds with one stone!

:)
