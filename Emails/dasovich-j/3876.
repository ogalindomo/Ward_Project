As promised, attached is the link to the database that my group will soon 
roll out.  Please keep in mind that this database covers items that are 
pertinent to electricity and gas.  I want you to get an idea of the sorts of 
things that we are keeping up with.  As you look at this, please think about 
items that we should include in a similar database that would contain 
EBS-specific issues.

Also, the electricity/gas database will be used primarily by commercial 
groups and is for internal use only.  Once populated, the data will need to 
be periodically updated.

When you open the database, choose "electricity" on the left side of the 
screen (we have not yet populated the "gas" section).  Then choose one of the 
many topics that appears.  Please keep in mind that we are still populating 
the data - there are a few categories that do not contain information yet.  
Code of Conduct and Environmental are full of information.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  It is my hope that 
I can address them prior to our next conference call.

Thanks!
