Dan,
yes, please forward summaries for Sierra Pacific - they are much 
appreciated.  I am not interested in the gas side.  But, as with Socal Gas, 
do whatever works for you administratively.

Also, could you please put Gordon Savage back on your distribution list? 
(gsavage@enron.com)  I will be transitioning out of California.  But please 
keep me in the loop until I let you know when I move onto a different region.

Thanks,
Tamara Johnson.
