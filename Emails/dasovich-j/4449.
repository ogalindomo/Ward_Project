Hey Everyone,

I want to invite all of you to a Holiday Party December 23rd at my parent's
house in Ross.  Attached below is the invite and a text copy of the invite.

A group of us always go on a hike during the day in the hills up around
Phoenix lake.  Feel free to join us for the hike.  If you can't make the
hike, feel free to come for the hot tub part of the party or for the
official beginning of the party at 5pm.

I hope to see you all on the 23rd.  Happy Holidays.  (please RSVP by next
Saturday!)

Sean
