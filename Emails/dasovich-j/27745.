Everyone,

Elizabeth Linnell and I are updating the "California Solutions" intranet 
site.  I think you'll find it to be a useful resource in the next couple of 
weeks, but in the meantime, I am asking that everyone submit to me the 
following materials to me asap (this applies to NY, DC, the West and 
California):

1) All white papers/briefing books/one-pagers etc. that you have completed in 
the past two months.  Documents from external sources that are in line with 
our positions are also welcome.

2) Any upcoming conferences/meetings etc that need to be posted on the 
calendar. 


thanks!
