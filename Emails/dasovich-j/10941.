Finally got the DirecTV dish working and it's terrific!  It's twenty times
faster than what my modem gave me before launching the new equipment.  I
downloaded a Mozart symphony (played by a quartet, believe it or not) from
Napster which was almost ten megabytes in size in about two and a half
minutes.  Ordinarily that would have taken about forty-five minutes to
download.  I only had to cut down one limb of a tree to get the dish aimed
properly.  I really appreciate the Christmas gift.  I haven't switched my
email service over yet so that will take a couple more days.  When I do,
I'll let you know the new address.  Thanks again.
