Hi, Jeff --

I'm sure you've seen today's article in the San Diego Union-Tribune
headlined, "Power-company Profits Climb Along With Prices."  The last
sentence of the article from Harry Snyder at the Consumers Union in San
Francisco is troubling, when he says, "They (power industry) don't have
consumers' interest at heart."  That's exactly what you want!  If there is
anything at all that I can do to support Enron here in San Diego, please
let me know.

By the way, I did hear from Rick Counihan.  He said that we're in the top
two of the PR firms the coalition interviewed, and that he hoped they'd
make a decision soon.  My threat to jump off a building unless he called me
must have worked!

Hope to see you soon --

Dana
