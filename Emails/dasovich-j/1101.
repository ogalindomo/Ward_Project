Jeff,
Sounds great.  I will be in California on at least Wednesday - Thursday so 
Friday would work well. 

Thanks again.
Mike

Getting you the info by the end of the week, or sooner, will not be a problem.

I forgot to give you an idea of the timing for the request I sent you 
earlier.  We are shooting to have the models completed this week.  The 
Alstrom deal was placed on a fast track last week.  If possible, it would be 
very beneficial to have your input by then.  Let me know your schedule.

Thanks again,
Mike
