 In response to your requests, I have attached a copy of the final
examination I used last year in the daytime version of this course.  Note
that because of some changes in course content and emphasis, the last two
questions are outside the scope covered in E201a.  The remainder of the
exam is indicative of the style  and range of difficulty and content of the
questions typically asked in this course.
