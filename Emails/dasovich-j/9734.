First and most important, for those of you that have room reservations at The 
Woodlands Resort and Conference Center, if you have any changes that need to 
be made or have decided NOT to stay, I need to know immediately so that we 
can cancel and are not charged for those rooms.  
Please call me directly and do not contact The Woodlands Resort.  Please see 
the "revised" Agenda and review the Rooming List for accuracy and advise of 
any corrections at this time.



Geriann Warner and I will be out at the Woodlands for the March 9th meeting 
only.  We will be in the office on Thursday if anyone needs assistance.  
Please have your presentation to me by Thursday for those of you who are 
giving presentations.  If we need to make copies of your presentation, please 
advise as well.  Eric Benson will be present for the March 8th meeting.
