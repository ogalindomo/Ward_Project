All,

I've made reservations for 12 at 6:30 at Woodward Gardens. They supposedly
opened a back room, so now have room for more people. Cameron still wants me
to look into Liberty Cafe, but anyway, we have reservations somewhere, at
least.

Also, Nancy and Eldon, Cameron said to me that she totally understands if
you guys don't want to come into the city just for that. Of course, we want
you there! It's just something to consider if you think it'll be too much,
what with the Dome and all, and then turning right around to come into the
city for dinner...

Thanks,

Scott
