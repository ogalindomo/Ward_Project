Argentina's Buenos Aires Province, Azurix Set Pact, Paper Says
1/26/1 7:7 (New York)


     Buenos Aires, Jan. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Argentina's Buenos Aires
province will likely sign an accord with water company Azurix
Corp., a unit of the world's largest energy trader, Enron Corp.,
in the next week, newspaper El Cronista reported, citing company
and government officials.
     The agreement will lay out a number of projects Azurix will
complete in the next year to improve drinking water services in
the province. The improvements will cost $30 million to $40
million, Eduardo Sicaro, undersecretary of public services for
Buenos Aires province, told the paper.
     The agreement would bring to a close an earlier conflict in
which Buenos Aires Gov. Carlos Ruckauf said the province might try
to revoke Azurix's contract for poor service. Ruckauf said he
would convene special legislative sessions to consider revoking
the company's contract.
     Houston-based Azurix has invested $94 million of the $439
million it promised to win a 30-year water concession with
Argentina's most populous province. Residents of Bahia Blanca, a
port and petrochemical center, complained in May of foul smelling
water.
