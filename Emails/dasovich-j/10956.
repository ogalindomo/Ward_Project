Thanks very much Scott.  Any view on when we can expect the clean-up bill 
will be signed?  And is there anything of substance in the "clean-up" 
provisions that we ought to be aware of?  Thanks again.
Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

As expected, Governor Davis did sign SBX 43 into law.  I also expect him to
sign ABX 43, which is the SBX 43 clean-up bill, into law this week.
