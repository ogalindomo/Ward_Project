I would like someone from the regulatory group to bless this .  I would 
recommend Jim Steffes or Rick Shapiro.

Subject: Credit Link Notes - California Disclosure

Paula:

Attached is a draft of the proposed disclosure relating to California for the 
Credit Linked Note offering memorandum.

While the concept of the disclosure was proposed by Salomon and Milbank, the 
enclosed draft has been fully reviewed and edited by Vicky Sharp, Rex Rogers, 
Ron Astin, Gareth Bahlmann, Tim De Spain and me.  Before returning the draft 
to Salomon, I wanted your group to review as well.

Please let me know if you have any questions, we would like to get this back 
to Salomon by the end of the day if possible.

Thanks
