Confused about where to donate your newly acquired IPO millions?
Want to give back to the community even though you haven't struck it rich?

Or do you just need a extra unit this semester?

Don't worry!? Professor Van Loo can help!

Come join her 1-unit Contemporary Philanthropy (BA278.2) class which meets 
for 10 weeks on Mondays from 4:00-6:00.? The course objectives are to 
increase knowledge of the reasons for giving, the variety of ways in which it 
takes place, the wide variety of people who participate, and the importance 
of it in creating a high quality of life.

This is a thought-provoking and fun class with no pre-reqs or final exam.? 
Class attendance, participation and one five page paper is it!? Plus, anyone 
who registers by this Thursday using the standard on-line registration 
process will be guaranteed admission to the Paul Newman presentation on 
Thursday September 7, the next class lecture (a make-up class for Labor Day 
holiday).

First Year, Second Year and Evening Students are all welcome!!!?? Sign up now 
and Professor Van Loo will confirm your enrollment with an email.
