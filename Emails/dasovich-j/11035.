Assembly Rev & Tax Cmte Chair Ellen Corbett has  decided that there will be a 
suspense file in her committee, with the same  threshold as the 
Appropriations Committee (i.e., $150,000 fiscal impact).?  You may recall 
that former chair Johan Klehs had a similar rule, but it was  discarded in 
1995 and has not been used since then.? An exception to this  rule will be 
measures that gain revenue (such as AB 128x, the excess profits tax  on 
energy generators).? Therefore, as all tax bills have at least that much  
fiscal impact, all bills will go to suspense.? How many will come of is  
another question.
