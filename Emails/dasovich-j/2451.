Subject: Revised Motion


Please review the attached and give me your comments ASAP.  I would like to 
file tomorrow.  Seab: Please read carefully for economic content.

Mary: I incorporated your comments from last night along with the matters 
that we discussed by phone yesterday.  However, I just received your fax and 
wanted to get this moving since incorporating those edits would slow down the 
process by several edits.  I'll take a look at your edits while you review 
the attached.

Ron
