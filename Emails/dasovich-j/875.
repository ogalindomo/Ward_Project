I won't say I'm surprised by your decision, but am saddened.  On the other 
hand, you aren't rid of me yet.  I WILL be a force to be reckoned with out 
there.  (actually I should say here.  I am in San Diego again today.)

I am on the run, as usual, but will catch up with you.  Just promise me that 
Rick will buy us dinner next time I am there.
