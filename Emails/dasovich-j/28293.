As we discussed on the conference call this morning, attached is the 
Consumers Union filing requesting FERC to suspend market based rate authority 
and establish cost of service rates for sellers selling in the entire Western 
region for three years.

Interventions are due on July 17.  The notice is attached as well.  Let's 
discuss whether we should respond.
