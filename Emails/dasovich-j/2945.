Attached is a ruling just issued by Commissioner Duque with regard to the  
SCE and PG&E emergency petitions for modification concerning the end of the  
rate freeze decisions.? (Interestingly, the version sent out shows  redlining 
from an earlier draft. The most interesting change was the  deletion of the 
sentence, "Nevertheless, the accounting modifications  contemplated are all 
that we can reasonably resolve in the remaining four  Commission meeting 
dates left in year 2000.")? 
?
Duque reiterates a commitment to reaching a final decision on accounting  
issues by the end of the year.? The TURN proposal will obviously get  primary 
attention.
?
He also says that, "at the December 21, 2000 Commission meeting, I will  
sponsor an Order Instituting Investigation (OII) that will open a proceeding 
to  address any residual TRA undercollection problems affecting PG&E and  
SCE.? Such an OII will offer an appropriate forum for addressing this issue  
in a comprehensive way, and it will provide an opportunity to develop a full  
record on this matter."
