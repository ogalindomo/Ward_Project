Subject: EMR "Volatile Energy Prices" Conference Group Rate

Tim Belden has asked me to negotiate a lower group rate for attendance at 
EMR's October 12-13 conference. Belden's speaking at this, and the full 
agenda is at http://www.econ.com/emrindex.html (click on "Conference"). Would 
you be interested in sending people? If so, how many?
