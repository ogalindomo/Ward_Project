Alan --

Some other thoughts:

1. Are we sure that we have the permission from the SC customers that we can 
give out their information?  Someone may want to get the names of these 
parties and more details.

2. Should we move the market power section to the third point and bring up 
points 2 and 3?

Thanks.

Jim
