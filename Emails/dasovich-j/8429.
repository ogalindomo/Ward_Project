Jeff;
This is Tim Ray.  Long time no talk to.  I am with New Power now and am in 
need of talking over Socal Gas Accord with you.  We are contemplating 
entering the Calf market.  However, it sounds like there are a myriad of 
changes to be implemented by Socal this year that would effect cost curves 
and marketing.  I need to spend some time talking to you about these and how 
they can effect us.

I am really not familiar with the Accord issues at all so I am in true need 
of your help.
