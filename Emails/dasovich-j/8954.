FYI -- Five of PGE's 25 suppliers agreed to execute the PG&E's proposed 
security agreement, including two Dynegy entities.  Two entities (a Goldman, 
Sachs affiliate and Western Gas Resources) shut off gas supplies immediately 
upon termination of the DOE order.  PGE indicated a need to continue to 
negotiating with other suppliers for additional gas suppliers, so they may 
come around.
