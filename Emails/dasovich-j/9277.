Carolyn, you're a star.  Thanks for the input , Anil.  For what it's worth,
I'll take a final looksee this evening and tie up any loose ends (though I
doubt that there will be any).  I'll send around to all for one last peek
in the morning, and I'll bring a copy to turn in.  Sound reasonable?  Let
me know.

Best,
Jeff
