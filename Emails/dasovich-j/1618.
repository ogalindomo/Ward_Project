Hi Everyone,

I've attached a document that will describe in greater detail the mechanics
of the Mid-Program Academic Retreat.  Please pay careful attention to the
following three matters:

(1)  The retreat will be held January 12-14 at Seascape Resort.

(2)  There is a required Pre-Work Meeting from 6:00 - 9:00 pm prior to the
retreat on either Tuesday, January 9 or Wednesday, January 10, depending on
which team you have been assigned to.  Team assignments will be distributed
within the next few weeks.

(3)  You will be asked to share a one- or two-bedroom suite, as described
in the attachment, so be thinking about with whom you'd like to share a
suite.  Roommate requests are due to the office by Friday, October 13.

Cheers, and I hope your third semester is going well!
