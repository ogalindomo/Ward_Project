Hi Everyone,

Here are the team assignments for MPAR.  In late November/early December,
I'll be sending you all the materials (CDROM, faculty
bios/assignments/etc.) for the simulation.  For now, there's nothing that
you need to do, but I thought you'd want to know on which night before the
MPAR weekend your team will be meeting.

Teams meeting on Tuesday, January 9:  Pacific 2, 4, and 6, Atlantic 2, 4,
and 6

Teams meeting on Wednesday, January 10:  Pacific 1, 3, 5, Atlantic 1, 3,
and 5.

Cheers,

Diane
