Mona - Please delete the tiles on your Lotus Notes desktop that used to
take you to the system, and then reload the databases with these links.
We've moved the system from EES to Corp., which is why the access has been
sketchy.

Let me know how it works, we're still testing the new links.  Thanks!

Elizabeth:

Below are the links to each of the new databases. Forward this note to all
users. I've included the path to the database in case, for some reason, the
link doesn't work.
