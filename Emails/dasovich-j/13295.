AN ISO STAGE 2 ALERT (5% Reserve Margin) HAS BEEN DECLARED.

Today, 05/31/2001, California's electric reserves are approaching critically
low levels.  To avoid possible blackouts and help lower energy costs, we
need your help.  Please take the necessary actions to reduce non-critical
electric use as soon as possible.

The next blocks scheduled for rolling blackouts are blocks 1 and 2.

Thank you for your cooperation.
