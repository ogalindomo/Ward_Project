Mike, there are several comments in Natividad's Declaration that I would like 
to revise.  Maurice Winter is currently reviewing it for accuracy on the 
meter aspects.  When do you need this?

Subject: Declarations

Attached are my comments to all declarations.  For the most part they look 
great.  

I have no comments on Navidad's (the metering expert)--but I ask Evan and 
Diann to review for accuracy.  I would also like Peggy and Jeff to review 
very carefully Dennis' declaration--there are several direct statements about 
our hedging strategy and our financial losses under the UCCSU K that will 
become public.  We either need to be comfortable with these statements or 
tone them down.  This is very important.

Please send me any comments.  MDS
