We may also want language that limits the "rate shock" of this type of 
activity to EES' customers?  

Janel, can you add to Monday's call agenda.

		 Subject: AB 25

AB 25 creates the Electric Rate Stabilization Auhtority which can arrange 
financing for the utilities' overpayment debt which is defined as the 
liabilities incurred between 6/1/00 and 3/31/01 through purchases of 
electricity from generators or other providers other than themselves, parent 
companies, affiliates,or subdivisions, for which ratepayer revenues were 
insufficient to pay.  This is one of those bills where your eyes glaze over, 
but I think the one area where we may have an issue, or desire clarification, 
is Article 5, PUC ratesetting.  The bill says that the PUC shall fix rates 
for the 3 utilities that provide them with sufficient revenues to pay the 
amounts assessed (by the Stabilization folks).  I think we would like 
language exempting direct access customers from these assessments in the bill 
itself.
