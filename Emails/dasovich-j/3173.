Attached is a file that has tracked the rate changes for the California IOUs 
since the beginning of deregulation.  We would appreciate any help you can 
provide in keeping this file updated.  By rate changes, we mean changes to 1) 
unbundled revenue requirements, 2) rate design/revenue allocation changes, 
and 3) new unbundled rate categories.  In addition to tracking changes, we 
would also appreciate heads up on any filings that propose to effect any of 
the three categories listed above.  This also includes changes to how PX 
credits and RCS credits might be calculated, which is a form of unbundling.
