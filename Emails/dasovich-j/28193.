Jeff,

Hopefully you already received a set of power point charts which are not on 
my laptop at the moment.

In case you did not, I am sending the source excel files, which I do have.  I 
basically sent you the charts in the first 3 sheets of the .xls file.

I can resend you power point versions in the morning if that helps.

Alan
