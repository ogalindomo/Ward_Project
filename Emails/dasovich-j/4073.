RETAIL MARKTERS SEE OPPORTUNITY IN NONTRADITIONAL
WAYS TO GROW CUSTOMER BASE
With a tight supply-demand balance for natural gas and power in most US 
regions,
CERA sees another difficult year ahead for retail marketers.

* Nontraditional means of acquiring customer bases may offer a better
opportunity for retail marketers to build market share in 2001 in order to be
better positioned when more attractive retail market opportunities open in
2002.

* Competitive retail suppliers are looking closely at supplying the regulated
customer base (through standard offer or default service) and municipal
aggregation to build customer base.

Movements by regulators to reset prices below market standard offers for 
power are
improving market conditions in several US Northeast states.
