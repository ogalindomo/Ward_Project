I took a call from a reporter this morning about pricing info for May 9 (the 
reporter wants to make the point that the state overpaid for its contracts).  
I got the following info from Bob Badeer:

May 9 -- prices at SP15 (location north of LA-south, but excluding LA) for 
July forward -- flat price, 7/24
 5-year: $75/MWh
 10-year: $63

today (6/28):
 5-year: $42
 10-year: $41
