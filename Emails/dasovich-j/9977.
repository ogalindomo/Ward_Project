Statement by Jan Smutny-Jones,
Executive Director of Independent Energy Producers,=20
in Response to State Senate Energy Probe
=20


"We understand that it is the responsibility of the legislature to ensure=
=20
that California ratepayers are protected =01. and we will fully cooperate, =
as we=20
have with other investigations, because we have nothing to hide.

"We believe this investigation will find nothing except that power producer=
s=20
have been working around-the-clock to help keep the lights on in California=
.=20
?In fact, there have already been several investigations by the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission the Public Utilities Commission and the=20
California Independent System Operator =01. and they have found no evidence=
 of=20
withholding or wrong doing.

"As we have continued to state: the industry does not condone business=20
practices that lead to unreasonable prices. ?It is our objective to help=20
create a stable regulatory environment in which robust retail markets can=
=20
flourish to protect ratepayers.

"This crisis can only be resolved if we all work together to find solutions=
=20
and stop pointing fingers, which only creates an unstable political and=20
regulatory environment which will do nothing to increase supply or reduce=
=20
demand in California.

"If this turns into, in fact, a =01@witch-hunt? against generators who have=
 been=20
providing electricity to California for months despite being owed billions =
of=20
dollars, my only question is who in their right mind would come to Californ=
ia=20
and invest in building new power plants? ?This sends a dangerous and chilli=
ng=20
signal to not only power providers, but anyone doing business or planning t=
o=20
do business in California."
