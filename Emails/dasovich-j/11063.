Mr. Myers,
My name is Jeff Fawcett.  I am a commercial representative of Transwestern=
=20
Pipeline Co. and was its witness during the recent GIR proceedings.  Given=
=20
Transwestern's role as one of the principal suppliers of natural gas to the=
=20
State of California, we are very interested in the outcome of these=20
proceedings and offer our assistance to the Commission in its investigation=
.

Much has been discussed in the press recently about pipeline infrastructure=
=20
in California, as well as the upstream capacity of FERC pipes that serve th=
e=20
California marketplace.  I know there is much to be covered in the 4/17=20
workshop.  However, if the schedule permits, Transwestern would like to off=
er=20
a brief overview of its delivery system to California and its view of the k=
ey=20
issues the Commission and stakeholders face as the investigation moves=20
forward.  TW=01,s presentation should take no more than 10-15 minutes.

Please let me know if the Energy Division would like TW to make such a=20
presentation and, if possible, approximately what point during the 9 -4:30=
=20
session Transwestern will be invited to step forward.  I=01,m available by=
