Hey team,

If anyone has any parts of the project, please send them to me.  We are
still missing the following:

1.  CAPM - complete analysis - there were some missing portions to the one
Chris sent over
2.  Sensitivity analysis - the numbers
3.  Paragraph on cash flow
4.  Final Executive summary
5.  Exhibit G (elasticity) - needs to be finished and discussion of
sensitivity analysis in exhibit A

Let's get together at the break and crank this out since we are running out
of time.

See you in class
