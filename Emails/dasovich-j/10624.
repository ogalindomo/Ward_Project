We've arranged a conference call this afternoon 1:30 PDT and 3:30 CDT to talk 
about our CA rate design comments.  First round is due Friday.  Jeanne 
Bennett attented the Commission's workshop yesterday and can fill us in on 
that and the CPUC's schedule.  Below is a suggested strategy for comment that 
Scott Stoness and I have discussed.

Jeff - I talked to Bob Weisenmueller briefly last Friday - do you want to 
bring him into this call or discuss with him later?

Call-in:
