TO:?? Colleagues

SUBJECT:? Final  Version

I've done my best to include your very helpful  comments.? The document now 
also contains a summary.

I would like  your endorsement, by noon PST (Wednesday) if possible.? A 
number of you  have already indicated you would sign it.? Also, Tom Campbell 
has  indicated he will try to recruit Ken Arrow.? I believe one of you 
agreed  to recruit Dan McFadden.? Laura is working on Larry Summers.? Solow  
would be a great addition, too.

Can we agree on the following division  of labor from here out:

1.? Recruiting others:?  All

2.? Media representatives:? Campbell, Tyson, Spiller,  Verlerger, Wilk, 
Teece, and Hogan (This is by no means meant to preclude  anyone contacting 
the media after we go public.)

???  On media, we are giving the LA Times a 24-hour exclusive.? We won't  
release to other media sources until 9:00 AM Thursday.

Many  thanks for your involvement and endorsements.
