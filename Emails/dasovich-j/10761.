HI Everyone,

As you know, we now have two rounds of admission for the EvMBA Program, and
we have just sent out admission letters to the first round of
applicants.  Since there will be so much time between now and when we
contact them about the New Student Orientation, we decided to institute a
New Admits Reception for Round I applicants.  These newly admitted students
have not yet accepted our offer of admission, so the purpose of this event
is to "close the deal."

This reception will be held on Thursday, April 19 from 7:00 - 9:00 pm in
the Wells Fargo Room.  We cordially invite you to join us in welcoming our
new EvMBA students (we've admitted 55 students in Round I) and to talk with
them about your experience in the program.  Many of you on this
distribution list have a class on the night of the reception, so we thought
you might be available to stop by during the break.

We're planning wine and hors d'oeuvres from 7:00 - 8:00 pm, then Rich Lyons
has graciously agreed to give a 1/2 hour talk entitled "New Frontiers in
International Finance."    In addition, we've invited faculty  and alums to
attend.

We'd greatly appreciate your RSVP to me or Meg St. John (mstjohn@haas) so
that we can make appropriate catering arrangements.

Cheers,

Diane
