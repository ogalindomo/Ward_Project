Folks  --  Attached is the report sent to the Commission regarding the 
California "settlement conference" on forward contracting.  As expected, this 
conference has expanded in scope and Judge Wagner is now seeking a 
"comprehensive settlement" for California.  Please give me a call if you 
would like additional information.  Joe 202.466.9150
