Jeff,

Please make sure that you are registered in the mailing list for the class
(see syllabus).  Here is the info that I sent on Monday:

http://haas.berkeley.edu/Courses/Spring2000/BA248D/

It has two pages: one is public (main page) and the other is reserved for
the use of the class exclusively.  Please do not distribute username or
password.

Username: user248  Password: hartman

If you find anything interesting to put up for everybody, let me know.

Cheers,

Edgard A. Capdevielle
