The following author's amendments are expected in  committee on Monday 
afternoon (actual Leg Counsel language is supposed to come  back Monday 
morning):
1.? The tax will be on excess gross receipts  from electrical energy 
distribution.
2. The tax will be imposed on the person making the  first sale of electrical 
power in or into CA for consumer  consumption.
3. The tax will be based upon the amount by which  the gross receipts from 
the sale exceed the amount that would have been received  if the sale had 
been made at a specified "base price" (to be determined by the  PUC).
4.? There will be a rebuttable presumption  that the base price represents 
afair sales price.
5.? There will be a withholding mechnism of  this excess tax from the 
purchasers, other than purchasers who are residential  consumers or small 
business users.
6.? It will require sellers to file annual tax  returns to report the tax on 
excess gross receipts and pay any remaining taxes  due.
7.? It will allow sellers to file a claim for  refund in an attempt to rebut 
the presumption that the base price was a fair  sales price.
8.? Provide certain nexus standards to  California to provide the basis to 
impose tax liability.
9. Include a 5-year sunset date.
No opposition has been received by the Rev &  Tax Cmte as of Wednesday of 
this week.? Therefore, no opposition (or  support) will be listed in the 
committee's analysis.
