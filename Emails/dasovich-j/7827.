For anyone who is interested in learning more about spectrum issues, on 
Friday, January 5, 2001, we will be having a 1-day seminar on spectrum at 
Enron in Houston.  Bennett Kobb (spectrum author/guru) will be lecturing, 
courtesy of Jim Fallon.  Please let me know if you are interested in 
attending and plan to be there.  

Thanks.
