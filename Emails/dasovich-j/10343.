Greetings:

Attached please find the ISO's comments, as filed at FERC (including 3
attachments), and the Market Surveillance Committee's comments, which we are
unclear whether these were filed or not. IEP is currently reviewing them in
light of the accusations made today and with respect to the overall flaws
with the ISO Market Stabilization Plan.  We will keep you posted.
