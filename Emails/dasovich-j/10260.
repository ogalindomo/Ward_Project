I wanted to write to you to apologize for any inconvenience as a result of
my having to cancel the class at the last minute.  My asthma acted up and I
needed to go to the doctor's office to get treated.  Because I did not
anticipate having to cancel the class, I was unable to give you advance
notice which could have saved you a trip to the campus.

For the purposes on the next class on 4/02 (since 3/26 is spring break), I
will pick up where we left off.  I will lecture on futures, forwards and
swaps in the first half of the class and cover the goodyear case in the
second half.  We can then discuss how to make up for the lost time.
