Jeff - I know Enron is always looking for good people so I thought I'd 
forward you the resume from one of the people who report to me.? Dale has a 
great combination of technical and organizational skills that have been very 
valuable to my organization.? He has family in Texas and is looking to move 
back to the Houston area depending on the opportunities available.? Anything 
you can do to facilitate forwarding this in the organization would be 
appreciated.? Thanks.
