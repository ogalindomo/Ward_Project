Subject: direct access


 Karen:

After we got off the phone, we had another idea re: messaging on direct
access that we thought we would share with you so that you could pass it on
during your next discussion with Peggy, Jim, Jeff, et.al.

Since Enron has a good relationship with Cisco Systems, would it be possible
to have John Chambers and Cisco deliver some of Enron's messages re: direct
access, i.e.
Like the UC and CSU system, Cisco entered into a contract with Enron for
energy services
Enron continues to honor its contract with Cisco,  Cisco remains an Enron
customer.
Although PG&E now supplies the electrons instead of Enron, Cisco still pays
the same amount for its energy
Since the inception of the contract, Cisco has saved XXX million.
The legislature should restore direct access (SB27x) so that businesses can
continue to manage their energy costs
