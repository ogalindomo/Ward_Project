Please welcome Carmen Perez to our EBS Government Affairs group.  Carmen, who 
comes from the international government affairs group, is now the assistant 
for myself, Donald, Lara and XiXi.  She can be reached at 713 345-4952.

Carmen will be helping to organize us on many fronts, including budget 
matters.  (More details to come on that on our next Monday morning call).  
Additionally, Carmen will be keeping a calendar for use of our standing 
bridge line.  Feel free to use the line as often as you need, but please 
check with Carmen first so that we're not all trying to use it at the same 
time.

Also, I would like to welcome Karen Huang to our group.  Karen, who comes 
from EBS,  will be Scott's assistant in the Portland office.  Karen can be 
reached at 503 886-0396.
