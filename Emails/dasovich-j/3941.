The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights (FTCR), a non-profit public
interest consumer organization headed by Harvey Rosenfield, held a press
conference today in the Capitol to unveil a proposed initiative for the
March 2002 ballot to re-regulate the electricity market.  FTCR's key points
of reform:

-- Requires refunds to San Diego customers (and customers of other regions
that may subsequently experience deregulation) of excessive electricity
charges through a windfall profits tax on profiteering power generators;
-- Requires oversight of electricity rates by the Public Utilities
Commission (PUC);
-- Institutes an integrated resource planning process to address future
energy needs;
-- Creates a state power authority to ensure the fulfillment California's
energy needs, promote conservation, and construct and operate power plants,
transmission and distribution facilities;
-- Facilitates the authority of local and state government to exercise the
power of eminent domain if necessary; and
-- Creates strong accountability mechanisms for state agencies.

The press conference was well attended by the media, print and TV, although
there were few insightful questions.  In Rosenfield comments, he blamed all
the stakeholders equally on the current problems, including the thieving,
greedy generators; utilities; and California and federal policy makers.  His
main point was that this problem can't be fixed until the system is entirely
re-regulated.

Jan made himself available to talk to reporters outside the press conference
and provided a different view of the current market situation and how it
should be fixed.  His comments were also well covered by the attending
media.
