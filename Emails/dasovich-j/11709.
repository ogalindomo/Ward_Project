On April 11, 2001, PG&E filed Advice Letter 2101-E in which it proposes a
new rate schedule -- "Schedule E-Gen -- Generation Component Unbundling".
Therein PG&E proposes that total generation charges be comprised of two
parts -- (1) charges for power provided by DWR and (2) other generation
charges.  The DWR charges will be determined the multiplying the percentage
of sale serve by DWR by germination charges base on the rates terms and
conditions of each electric rate schedule. The other generation consists of
QFs and other purchase power agreement costs and the costs of PG&Es
remaining generation plants as well as any charges received from the ISO
relating to real time energy purchase costs.

In relation to this, as part of the just concluded rate design proceeding,
PG&E has proposed in its testimony to eliminate Schedule PX and "replace
energy charges derived based on the schedule with generation  charges."
When cross-examined, the witness clarified that what they proposed in Advice
2101-E (Schedule E-Gen) would be the replacement for Schedule PX.  Thus,
apparently, Schedule E-Gen will be the basis for determining the direct
access  credit.

If we want to  protest this advice filing along the lines of the SCE one, we
must do so Tuesday May 1st.
