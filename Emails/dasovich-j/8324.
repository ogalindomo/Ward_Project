Jeff: 

Some catch up items re ETI and California: 

I gather from Steve that you are changing the corp status of ETI to a LLC.? 
We may need to file for a formal transfer of ownership at the CPUC when you 
are ready. 

Also, we still need (some day soon) to file the ETI initial tariffs with the 
CPUC - upon initiation of services in California (that is, when you want to 
start providing service in CA). 

We previously sent you several ICAs for California, though you probably will 
need some additional formal analysis.? Please let me know if the recent ICA 
Memo raised any questions or issues amongst your team. 

Trust you saw the interesting Enron energy article in Sunday's front section 
of the LA Times, and that your New Year is off to a bang.
