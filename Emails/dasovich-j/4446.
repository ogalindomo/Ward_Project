It looks like the California Electric Issues will not be addressed in the 
Courts.  This leaves the CPUC (President Lynch taking direction from the 
Governor) and potentially the Legislature.

Subject: California Supreme Court Denial of PG&E Petition


According to PG&E Corp.'s December 8, 2000  "8-K", on November 21, 2000, the
California Supreme Court denied PG&E's petition seeking review of an
appellate decision which had denied PG&E's appeal of the CPUC decisions
prohibiting post freeze recovery of cost incurred prior to the end of the
rate freeze (e.g., power purchase costs).
