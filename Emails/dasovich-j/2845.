Gas OII/OFO Settlement Parties:

Attached please find PG&E's OFO Report for the Third Quarter 2000.  This is
provided to you in accordance with the Operational Flow Order ("OFO")
Settlement Agreement between PG&E and many other parties, filed in the
CPUC's Gas Strategy OII 99-07-003, and approved by the CPUC by Decision
00-02-050.  Section C.1.f. of that Agreement requires PG&E to prepare a
Quarterly OFO Report concerning the number and causes of OFO events within
the prior three months.

The attachments consist of the Report (in Word) and two Appendices (in
Excel).  Should you have any trouble opening either document, please contact
my secretary, Darcy Morrison, at telephone (415) 973-6644, or e-mail her at
D2Mr@pge.com.

At the OFO Forum on August 29, 2000, the parties decided not to hold another
Forum meeting to discuss this Third Quarter 2000 OFO Report, unless there
were other significant developments.  Based on the results shown in the
attached Report, we see no current need for an OFO Forum meeting in the near
term.  We suggest evaluating the events of the final quarter of 2000 to
determine whether or not to hold a Forum meeting in early 2001.

If you have any questions on this report, please call Rich Hall at (415)
972-5115.
