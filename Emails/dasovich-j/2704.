Word on the street is that the CA ISO staff is NOT asking for a vote on price 
caps at the Board meeting on Thursday.  (I was speculating that the Board 
would be asked to lower the price caps to $100 or to adopt the CEO's 
proposal, which he filed at FERC on 10/20.)  The vote will be put off a vote 
until late November.  No reason given -- but presumably so they don't look 
like idiots if FERC comes out with something radically different on November 
1.

But, I have also heard that one Board member -- Mike Florio of TURN -- has 
asked for a vote on his proposal -- load-differentiated price caps (e. g.$250 
when area load is 40,000 MW or more, $150 when load is between 30,000 and 
40,000, etc.) If a few Board members, i.e., the utilities and some of the 
munis gang up, they can force a vote.  I'm expecting one, but given the 
staff's/CEO position, there may not be sufficient votes to go lower until 
FERC comes out with its proposal.

Maybe small miracles can happen in California ...
