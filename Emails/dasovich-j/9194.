Hi folks.

As I mentioned in my last e-mail, I am sending reminders about our next
meeting Feb. 24.  I'd prefer sending this message closer to that date, but
I'll be out of the country and may not have e-mail access.

So, the reminders are:

Bring five (or more!) impromptu topics.

Bring a blank videotape if you want to be a video star (or just want it for
personal and or extra-me evaluation).

We will start class promptly at 9:00.

I look forward to hearing all of your revised speeches.

Take care.

Bill
