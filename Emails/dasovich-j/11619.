Hi Continuing Evening MBA students,

Thanks for registering on Telebears!
Thanks for your e-mails with class preferences!

We have downloaded your requests from Telebears and are now placing
students into elective courses based on seniority in the program.  We will
e-mail your confirmed class schedules on Friday, May 4.

DO NOT make changes on Telebears at this point.  We are not downloading
from Telebears again for Fall 2001 and will not see your changes.

IF YOU HAVE CHANGES:  You will have an opportunity to adjust your schedules
from May 4 - May 11 by e-mailing me at that time (tj@haas).

Then, on Monday, May 21, we will once again confirm your Fall 2001 class
schedules.  Please note, there will be no changes to schedule from May 12 -
August 26.

Thanks!
TJ
