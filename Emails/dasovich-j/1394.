My Haas e-mail is forwarded to my work e-mail.  Last week I was on vacation
and did not see any of these e-mails.  I worked all 4 questions in what
turned out to be a parallel path (I will say your compiled answers were a
lot better than mine).  Anyway, please add my home e-mail address
"jcjcal02@aol.com" (Thats a zero next to the 2) in addition to my hass email
address.  This will give me access to the data regardless of where I'm at.
This is particularly important on weekends.  Sorry I let you down on the
first case.
Jimmy
