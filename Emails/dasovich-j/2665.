I vote for waiting until Monday to discuss.  This is one part of the larger 
PR / Government Affairs strategy in California.  We need Karen Denne (PR) to 
come to Portland for the meeting on Monday.

When do you guys want to talk through this?  Who should be involved?  Can it 
wait until Monday when we have our California meeting here in Portland?
