Subject: Gruma's call for help, re: Cal.

Marty,
I rec'd. a call from Steve Brunner this afternoon, requesting assistance from 
us regarding their California situation.  

Irwin Gordon just returned from Cal. and has many questions about the future 
direction of California's energy environment, and what Gruma's options might 
include.  Boiling it down, Irwin and his senior leadership team would like to 
meet with Enron's "California expert" to talk about the current and future 
scenarios, in order that Gruma can make more intelligent near-term 
decisions.  They would like to do this next week if at all possible.

FYI, we have already had several conversations with Steve over the past week 
pertaining to our current posture in California, and I've furnished him with 
the letter we sent to our customers, and the PowerPoint slides prepared for 
meetings on the subject.  While these were helpful, Gruma's response was "not 
enough depth...didn't answer all of our questions."

Steve gave me a good overview of Gruma's questions and issues which I can 
discuss further with you or whomever you designate to meet with Gruma.

Let me know if I can further clarify.
George
