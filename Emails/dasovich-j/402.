Subject: Meeting Saturday

We will meet again on Saturday to continue our discussion on the Ford case
for marketing.  If you were not at the first meeting and would like to come
on Saturday, please let me know.  We propose sharing the work that we
accomplished yesterday, and asking the new comers to bring something to
contribute.  Chrystine is working on some areas that could be assigned so
that we can cover as much material as possible with minimal overlap.

We were thinking of meeting at 10, and thought either Aaron or Jeff's
office
were viable.

Jeff, would your office work?

Let me know!

thanks,
Jackie
