My brain is fried.  Can you remember what kind of opt in-out thing the CPUC 
had?  I remember it being a fiasco.

Subject: California customer marketing question

Sue,
 Frank Rishe has ask me to search for the states that have allowed customers 
to opt in or out of marketing lists. Does California require utilities to 
offer a customer the opportunity to decide on who they want to market to them 
for energy services? If so did we take a position on it?

 Thank you so very much,
 Lynnette
