Is there any language that tells us that the surcharges are not applicable to 
future DA customers?  Obviously it should not since they would be paying for 
generation twice but the other surcharge did apply.  Please let me know ASAP.

Subject: California PUC Orders

Orders the CPUC voted out yesterday:


1) March 27 decision on California Procurement Adjustment:

 - CPUC01-#93704-v1-D0103081_A0011038_et_al__.doc
This tells the utilities to start paying DWR an amount per kwh equal to the 
utilities' average cost of generation for all power provided by DWR, and asks 
for additional comment on how the California Procurement Adjustment is 
calculated.

2)  March 27 decision on rate increase is not yet available but is largely 
unchanged from proposed decision:

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/cyberdocs/tcquickstart.asp?DOC_ID=93630&docType=LEGAL_P
ROCEED
This is the order that allows the rate increase to take effect.

3)  March 27 decision on rate design is not yet available but also is not 
likely to change from proposed decision:

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/cyberdocs/tcquickstart.asp?DOC_ID=93589&docType=LEGAL_P
ROCEED
This is the order that says the rate increase will not be a uniform across 
the board increase, but rather will achieve conservation and equity goals.

Regarding the rate increase of 3 cents, it is effective yesterday but the 
Commission did not describe exactly how it will be implemented.  For example, 
they could 
a) allow a 3 cent surcharge until the rate design phase is complete, and then 
switch over to the new rate design around, say, May 15; or
b) allow a 3 cent surcharge to be billed and then retroactively adjust the 
billing based on the new rate design, once it is known.
