If you thought I ignored any of your communications last week, I did it 
because I was on vacation.  I'm back!  I'll catch up as soon as I can.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketing Working Group

FROM: Don Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair

RE: Boston Pacific Statistical Research Project

Attached you will find a draft of a statistical research project, "A First 
Look at Price Spikes, Price Caps, and Their Effect on the Emergence of a 
Fully Competitive Electricity Market," prepared by Boston Pacific Company, 
Inc.  The project was commissioned by both EPSA and several members, all of 
whom had input into the development of the project.  The goal of the project 
is to provide some statistical background for the concerns surrounding the 
high electricity prices in California this summer.

Please review the attached document so we can discuss it on our weekly Power 
Marketers conference call and distribute the final product to FERC by the end 
of the week.  The call will be held on Wednesday, September 27th at 11:00 
a.m.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie 
Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions, please contact Julie Simon at 
202-789-7200 or jsimon@epsa.org.
