     Hi Team:

     I spent some time today working out answers to the two questions.  I
     claim no brilliance in this subject, but thought I would get us
     started.  There are definitely some holes in my answers (highlighted
     in red).  Please take a look and let's discuss at some point.  I hope
     my logic is transparent enough to make the spreadsheets useful to
     others.

     If everyone will be in class on Thursday maybe we can discuss the
     problems during the break and be finished before the weekend.  Woo
     Hoo!
