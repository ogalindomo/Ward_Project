		 Subject: Crain's Article - California Utility's Revamp is no Threat to  
Illinois


Letters to the Editor

CALIF. UTILITY'S REVAMP IS NO THREAT TO ILLINOIS

Crain's does readers a disservice in an editorial by stoking groundless fears 
that electricity supplied by Midwest Generation is somehow threatened by a 
debt refinancing of Edison International, our ultimate parent company ("Feds 
must ensure Illinois isn't singed in Calif. crisis," May 28).

Midwest Generation, based in Chicago, stands on its own financially and has 
its own set of lenders and covenants that would prevent financial 
consequences related to the California energy crisis. Our contracts to 
provide electricity to ComEd give us the strongest possible financial 
incentive to invest in our plants.

Under the refinancing approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
the stock of Edison Mission Energy would be used as collateral by its parent, 
Edison International, to achieve favorable terms for the refinanced debt. 
Edison International also owns the Southern California Edison utility, which 
has been plunged into well-documented financial hardship.

Midwest Generation stock would not be used as collateral. In fact, the 
refinancing actually provides yet another layer of insulation between Midwest 
Generation and Edison International.
