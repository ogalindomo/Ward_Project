Hello all,

Dave and I had our baby Vivienne Anne Kupiecki this past Saturday, May 19
at 8:05 am.  I have attached some of the first pictures of our little
one.  She is a petite girl at 5 lbs, 4 oz.

The family is in good health and doing well.

Feel free to call us at home if you like, 415 864 6916
