I left Jeff a voicemail.  I think he is trying to do this from eHRonline.  
You need to be out on the Intranet and type PEP.Corp.enron.com and it should 
bring up the PEP logo.  I told him to call me if he still  had trouble.

Regards,
Michelle

I tried to log in with the information provided:  ID--90008808;

there's someone that you'd like me to contact to get it resolved.  Thanks.
