Energy Committee Members:

Please find the updated language from the CEC on the Real Time Pricing
tariff attached.  As discussed at our last committee meeting, John Wilson
has asked for comments and suggestions to the language early this week.

Please review the updated language and provide comments by this Wednesday,
June 13 directly to John at [mailto:jwilson@energy.state.ca.us].  Please cc
me on this so that I may keep record of your comments as well.  Thank you
and apologies for the delay in providing you with this updated version.

Regards,
Laura
