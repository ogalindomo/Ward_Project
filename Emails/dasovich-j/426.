Jeff Dasovich,
I am letting the students form their own teams for the team projects.
They should be in groups of four, with variations in the number
needing advanced approval by me.  You can arrange for someone
to turn in Personal Problem Set #1 (due next week) for you, or turn
in both #1 and #2 on April 6 (when #2 is due).  You can also arrange
to have a video made of the lectures, and I leave my past handouts
outside my office door (F526) at the Haas School in case you need
them.
