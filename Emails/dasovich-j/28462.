P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed 
edits our discussion.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Re: REVISED Merged Leg Document

Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section 
that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that 
we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that 
document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 
30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.

Best,
Jeff
