Subject: IEP FERC/ISO: Draft IEP FERC Cmts on Staff Report
Importance: High

Attached in Word format are the draft IEP comments, due to be filed on the
22nd, regarding the FERC Staff Report on market monitoring and market power
mitigation.  This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to
change per our discussion during the call tomorrow.

I would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a
"circuit breaker" during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is
distinct from notions of market power abuse.  Other entities are arguing
that during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all
suppliers have and are "exercising" (as distinct from abusing?) market
power.  The draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context
characterized by the drought as a rationale for the "emergency circuit
breaker."

As mentioned in Katie Kaplan's email this morning, if your company has a
draft of comments, we would appreciate an opportunity to look at them to
avoid substantive conflicts.

I trust this is the right distribution list but I was not able to use the
list from this morning's email because of computer problems at my end.  ABB
