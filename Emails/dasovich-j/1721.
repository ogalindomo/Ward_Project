Leslie - I think we are soft pedalling our opposition to price caps for 
residential customers.  If that's what it takes to rescue dereg, seems like 
it's a small price to pay in the overall scheme of things.  Looks good.

		 Subject: Presentation in NM on California experience


I have plagarized Steve Kean's presentation on California and liberally 
sprinkled in some of the EPSA report to make a presentation tomorrow before 
the NMPRC and probably some legislators as well.  If you have a chance to 
review it for substance (or anything else) and can get back to me today, I 
would appreciate it.  If you don't have time, don't sweat it.  They never 
listen to me anyway!  Thanks
