Hi all,

After spending the last 6 hours searching the web for data
on comps (I've finally compiled a list of comparable
acquisitions that completed over the last couple of years),
I ran across the link below!!

Do any of you have access to Thomson Financial Securities
Data through your work? If you do, we should be able to get
all data on comps for this deal through Thomson (try clicking
on the "Comparable M&A Report" link from the page below
for a sample)...

We should be able to find someone with access. I'm actually
going to stop trying to do this myself... See you tomorrow...
