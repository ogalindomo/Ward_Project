Hi Everyone,
Attached is the standard format summary for South Korea.  I lost all sense of
grammar and sentence formation in putting it together, so good luck with 
it!   I
probably won't see you all on Saturday, so have a nice weekend!  (Footnote:  
My
vote is to give Anil, proud papa, anything the dude wants.  My preference for
the post-exam pow wow at Foreign Cinema would be either Thurs 12/16 or Tues
12/21, but of course, I defer to group consensus).
Later,
Charlotte
