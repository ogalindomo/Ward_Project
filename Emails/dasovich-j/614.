Scott, 

Cynthia Sandherr forwarded to me the email and presentation you sent her.  
Many of the issues you raised we have been working on for some time, as well 
as the Wasabi-related issues that were raised on our recent conference call.  
I'd like to set up a time to in the next few days where Donald Lassere and I 
can brief you on our political and regulatory strategy at both the state and 
federal levels, as well as follow up with you on the issues raised on the 
Wasabi call with the DC lawyer. We'd like to get your input, as well as 
better describe the group Enron has put in place to support EBS.  Please let 
me know your availability.  

Best, 

Scott
