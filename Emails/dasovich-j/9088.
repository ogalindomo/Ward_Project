As a result of our call regarding Steve's appearance before Congressmen 
Tauzin and Barton on the 21st, the need for current information in the 
following areas was highlighted:

 California specific issues:
Legislative      Sandi McCubbin
PUC      Harry Kingerski
Bankruptcy  
Environmental   Mary Schoen

Federal Issues: 

Top 5 things each Federal Executive Agency could do Tom Briggs
FERC Wholesale Issues


Jeff Dasovich and John Neslage will work to compile a comprehensive 
situational update, and also work to pare it down to essential talking points.

If anyone has any additional comments or additions, please let me know, and I 
will update our list accordingly.


Thanks-

John
