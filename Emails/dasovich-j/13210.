What time's the show?  Do we know what station?  Here are my points:

Stop the blame; stop the political rhetoric.
If there's evidence that manipulation has occured, produce it--the 
investigations have been going on for a year.  Stop the McCarthyist tactics.
Californians want a real, comprehensive solution that is bi-partisan
More supply
Less demand
No state takeovers; state out of procurement now.
A real energy market place (competition and choice)
Creditworthy utilities (prices that reflect the true cost of power)

I think we can give Gary some message points, agree?  What topics do we want 
him to hit -- stop the rhetoric, implement a comprehensive solution (which 
includes more than just rate increases), etc, etc...
