At a conference held this morning in the TAC proceeding, Chief Judge Wagner 
announced that it was his understanding that FERC will strike its 
consideration of the California matters from this Wednesday's meeting (12/13) 
in light of the fact that FERC has scheduled a special meeting for this 
Friday (12/15) to consider those matters.
