		 Subject: Committee hearing Wed. and AB 1x update

The Senate Energy Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday morning at 8am in 
room 4203 to debate AB 5x and AB 6x.  These are the measures that passed the 
ECA committee last week, relating to the ISO/PX governing boards, and utility 
retention of generation assets.
 
AB 1x passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee this evening with 
all the Dems voting for it and one Republican.  There were three amendments: 
1) a $400 million price tag was added, 2) a sunset review after 5 years was 
added, and 3) clarification was made that DWR is not permitted to get into 
the T&D business.  Rumor has it that Keeley understands that the 5.5 cents 
has to come out of the bill on the Senate side.  The floor vote is schedule 
for 8pm tonight.
