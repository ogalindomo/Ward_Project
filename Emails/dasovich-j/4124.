For your information:

Through a Capitol contact, I have learned that SCE is holding an energy
briefing for legislators and legislative staff next Wednesday when members
are back in town.  I have been promised to receive any materials that will
have been passed out at the briefing.

Karen and I, and IEP member company lobbyists, agreed at the lobbyists group
meeting two weeks ago that the best way to get across our message was
individual meetings with legislators.  We will have an opportunity to
discuss this further if you like when we talk about larger legislative
issues at Monday's Board meeting.

ALSO, Senator Burton held a press conference today and spent most of the
time talking about energy.  A media contact informed me that Burton's main
point was that all proposals are on the table, including the laundry list of
possible solutions circulated by Peace and the Governor's office.
