Apologies, but I'm trying to make sure that I have the meeting times right.

Monday 10:30 AM CDT--"All hands" meeting with business folks.
Monday 3 PM CDT--Washington Call
Tuesday/Thursday 1:30 PM CDT--California Call
Thursday 4 PM CDT--Leadership call

Do I have these right?

Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
