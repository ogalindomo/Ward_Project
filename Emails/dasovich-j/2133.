We haven't been sending too many group emails as we have been working in
smaller groups on particular slots for our conference.

John Fielder, Senior Vice President for Regulatory Policy and Affairs at
Southern California Edison, is the latest to accept our invitation to be one
of the panelists.

While we didn't get our first choice of John Bryson from SCE, we have a very
knowledgable and articulate senior representative from a regulated utility.
I think the comparable thing will happen with PG&E. As a whole, I think this
conference will be absolutely terrific in terms of the quality, depth of
knowledge, level, and diversity of viewpoints represented.

But--we need the confirmations from those with outstanding invitations ASAP.
We should be able to get out a draft program to you as soon as we get these.

Thanks,
Lee
