Good morning!

As you know, we need to determine the post certification requirements in each 
state that we are seeking a certificate for EBS so we can begin to focus on 
compliance.  Would you be so kind as to contact the local counsels in the 
states for which you are responsible and ask them to research the post 
certification requirements?

Hopefully, this request will be included in the contract we have with each 
firm and will not cost us anything more.  That may not be the case in some 
states, however.  

I am assisting Sue Nord in gathering this information and would greatly 
appreciate it if you would send me copies of the information the local 
counsels put together for you.

Let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks so much,
Margo
