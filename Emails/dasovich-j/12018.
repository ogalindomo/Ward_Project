This is related to the previous email re: the LNG storage proposal for 
California.  I have been looking at SoCalGas's storage tariff, and am having 
a little trouble making out some of the charges.  If you have a moment please 
give me a call or if you have a contact at SoCal I could talk to, that would 
work also.

Thanks.
