Jeff, as you may know we are conducting due diligence on 11 california QF's 
that El Paso Merchant Energy purchased from Dynegy on Feb 1 of this year.  we 
are considering the purchase of 50% of El Paso's interest.  In discussions 
with Paul he suggested that I get you involved with the transaction.  Two 
things come to immediate attention.

I heard that the PUC has filed suit against El Paso relative to these 11 
assets.  What do you know about this ?
NOw that the CPUC is trying to implement terms of AB 1890's section 390 alot 
of questions and methods are surfacing about calculations of payments to 
QF's.  Are you in a postion to follow this debate and keep me informed during 
the process ??


Thanks

Frank
