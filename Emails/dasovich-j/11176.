NBCi created a joint venture with a company called Asiacontent.com.  
They both put 13 million dollars into the venture, before the stock
market took a plunge. The two owners of the new venture (NBCi Asia) lost 
over 95% of their market caps. NBCi recently shut doors entirely.

I was on the board of NBCi Asia, and managed the company as president and 
chief operating officer. We opened offices in Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei and 
Singapore, and hired a very senior management team from some of the best 
known companies in Asia (like Samsung, Singapore Straights Times, Apple 
Asia). Media companies all over Asia were looking to do deals with us 
because we carried the NBC brand. Less than a year later, our funding was 
pulled, the offices were closed, and the only employees left were the 
lawyers.
