The way that I see it, the Rod Wright issues that are important the following 
-- everything else is either jurisdictionally questionable or can't fly on 
its own weight.

1. Reduce environmental roadblocks to bring more plants on line.  

WHY ARE WE ATTACKING THE ENVIRONMENT?  ANY PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM.

6. Provide IOU's with price management tools including bilateral contract and 
hedging authority.

GREAT FOR EPMI SOLUTIONS.

15. Extend the rate freeze for PG&E and SCE beyond 3/2002

NEED FOR EES BOOK.   ALSO NEED THIS TO END THE RADICAL CALLS TO "FIX" THE 
WHOLESALE MARKETS WITH WHOLESALE MARKET PRICE CAPS.

19. Repayment of under collections for PG&E and SCE.

OTHERWISE NOTHING ELSE WILL HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'LL BE FIGHTING ABOUT THIS ALL 
SESSION.

27. Utilities are deemed prudent in forward contracting.

NEED THIS FOR EPMI DEALS.

28. Manage volatility for residential customers through OREGON solution.

OR THROUGH DEFAULT SERVICE COMPETITION.  A MUST HAVE FOR POLITICIANS.  REAL 
QUESTION IS CAN THEY RAISE THE RATES A LITTLE TO MANAGE THE HIGHER COSTS AT 
WHOLESALE.
