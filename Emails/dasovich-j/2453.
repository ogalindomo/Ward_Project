Dear Electricity Summit Organizing Committee:

Attached to this e-mail message is the first draft of the conference
website. Please review it in the next two days and return suggestions to
me. It is a PDF file, therefore if you do not have Adobe Acrobat Writer,
you will not be able to make adjustments on your screen. I would suggest
printing it out, marking adjustments/additions/suggestions directly on the
paper, and faxing it back to me at: 510-643-9657.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Heather
