Ken's already strapped for time and we've giving him an aggressive list of 
CEOs to call (he probably won't make more than a handful of calls).  If you 
could call Peevey, that would be great.

Yes.  And I'd be happy to call him and harass him.  Better yet, if Ken Lay's 
willing to call him and harass him, that'd be better still. 

Best,
Jeff

Jeff/Janel/Paul -- I was just thinking about influential people to contact 
our top 5 legislators plus Davis...  Besides the Silicon Valley CEOs, Mike 
Peevey is pretty tight with and trusted by Davis.  When we met w/ Peevey, he 
told us he was in agreement on direct access -- how about a call to him 
asking him to weigh in w/ Davis.  Also, Peevey's wife is a freshman 
assemblywoman (Carol Liu, I think).  So I think Peevey is a key influential.  
What do you think? kd
