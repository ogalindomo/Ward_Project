Congratulations to the team.  In my humble opinion, we put together an
interesting, succinct, yet thorough presentation.  Good job.

Thanks to all.  Ended up working out pretty well.  We may have been the
only folks thus far that finished within 20 minutes (or 45 minutes, it
seems, for that matter).

Best,
Jeff
