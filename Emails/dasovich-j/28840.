Dear  Colleagues,

Much of our strategy of success on Energy issues in Sacramento over the last
several months has been due to the expert help of Dr. Barbara Barkovich.
(see attached documenting the scope of her work with SVMG).  Many of you
have met her either through her work with the Energy Committee or at Working
Council.   We are now reaching a critical phase of our legislative efforts
with bills that will affect California employers, workers and their families
for years to come and we rely on Barbara for the depth of her analysis,
insight and connections.  She is assisting on an every day basis to craft
our responses to extremely complex rate chane legislation that will create a
fair scheme for our businesses.  We are down to the wire here and need your
financial support.  Please help us continue this excellent partnership with
Barbara.  We have been working with her on a special contract for the
past 6 months at a rate of $5000 per month and need to retain her for
another 6 months for a total of $30,000.  If you can help with this matter
to please let me know right away.  Please send any pledges to
jbradley@svmg.org

Thank you, your help is greatly appreciated.
