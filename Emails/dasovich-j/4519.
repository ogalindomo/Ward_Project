If anyone has or expects to be able to respond to the FERC Order by
increasing QF production, please keep IEP aware of by documenting your
efforts and successes, and forwarding via email to IEP the status report.
We plan to compile the industry response to the FERC Order.  Thanks.\

Subject: FERC Order Granting Emergency Waiver of QF Regulations until
January 1, 20001


> In response to the FERC Order on the California marketplace, Ridgeway
Power
> filed comments argueing for a waiver of QF regulations in order to incent
> more power into the California marketplace.  IEP discussed this concept
with
> FERC Commissioners today and the Commission issued late today an Order
> Granting Emergency Waiver of QF Regulations for the remainder of this
year.
> This order is attached as part of an additional order by FERC granting the
> CAISO request for implementation of a $250 "soft cap" plus penalities for
> failue to respond to CAISO dispatch orders during an emergency.
>
> For QFs positioned to take advantage of the FERC Order, IEP suggests (1)
> procure legal advice because in essense you have an existing contract with
> the utility, (2) contact your utility/contract holder, and as appropriate
> move to implement the FERC Order.  Your existing bilateral contract with
the
> utility provides for a SRAC based payment mechanism which appears to apply
> under the FERC Order.   Note, however, that the waiver at this time only
> applies through the end of this year.  You may have other options as well.
