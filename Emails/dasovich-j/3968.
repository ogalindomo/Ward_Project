Subject: STOP THE SPIN!


>
> Hello,
>
> It has been reported on CNN yesterday (Nov. 27 2000) that 60% of Americans
think Al Gore should stop his fight - now all other media outlets are
picking up this poll and running with it.
>
> WE MUST STOP THIS SPIN NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
>
> IF you are someone that believes there is a real and right fight still to
be fought by the democrats - if you feel that they should not give up now -
please add your name to this list.

> Don't let the Republican spin and the news media win this battle. We need
to show our support for the democratic process which means that all votes
must be fairly and accurately counted.  PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO AS MANY
SUPPORTERS AS POSSIBLE!
>
> Let us remember the basic facts: Al Gore was said to have won the state of
Florida based on exit polls on election night, Al Gore is ahead in the
popular vote by almost 300,000 votes, there are 1000s of votes that sit
still never counted in the state of Florida. Al Gore is the most likely
winner of this election if all the votes are properly counted.
>
> There has been a rush to finish this process by the Bush Campaign not
because the American people are impatient but because they do not want all
the votes to be counted. Thus they are cleverly trying to declare this
desire for a quick finality to this election as the will of the people. They
have been slowly spinning this tale since the day after the election. Don't
let this spin persist. We must stop it in its tracks by making ourselves
heard!

> Last night - shortly after declaring victory Bush appointed Cheney the
head of the transition team. Cheney quickly asked for funds from the General
Services Administration in order to proceed with the transition. The GSA
denied this request, saying the election is still undecided. In response to
this the Bush Camp is proceeding with private funding. If this were any
other country we might even call this a coup d'etat.
