Hi Everyone,

Peter Fiske, an F99 entering student, has just published a second edition of 
his book The Take-Charge  Career  Guide for Scientists.  I asked him if I 
could let everyone know, and he sheepishly agreed - and also has invited you 
to the book-signing party.  (Peter is the Physics and Advanced Technologyies 
Directorate at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory)

Cheers,

Diane
