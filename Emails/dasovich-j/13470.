Another gas item which I had not gotten around to adding to the table yet:

Docket No.  CP01-106
Response to Kern River Petition for Declaratory Order
Due:  June 11 (?)
Affects the California Emergency Project to add 135 MM/d of capacity approved 
by FERC on April 6 with an expected in-service date of July 1, 2001.  On 
April 5 SoCal Gas notified Kern River that, pursuant to the terms of a 1989 
agreement between them, SoCal Gas was entitled to first rights, and was 
asserting such rights, on this or any capacity expansions into California on 
Kern's system.  We will support Kern River's petition.
Comments are being drafted.  SoCal Gas has asked FERC not to approve the 
shortened comment period of June 11; FERC has not responded yet.
