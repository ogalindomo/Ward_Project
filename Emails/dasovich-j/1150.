Hi Evening MBA Students:

Some of you have been asking about adding/dropping courses and the number
of spaces still available.  The SECOND round of classes will be e-mailed
Thursday evening, September 7.

Please come by soon to fill out an add/drop form.  You can also fax it in
to (510) 643-5902.

Thanks!
TJ
