Hi Everyone,

As you know, every semester I host a series of pizza dinners for each class
in the Evening
MBA Program.  The purpose of the dinners is to provide the students with a
smaller forum from which to ask questions and express concerns about the
program.

This semester's pizza dinners will be held during the weeks of  October 16
and October 23.  Below you will find listed the date of your class's
dinner.  All pizza dinners are held in C230 from 7:30 - 8:15 pm, except the
Monday pizza dinners, which will be held in the BofA Forum.   Please note
that the pizza dinners will not interfere with your class time if your
class meets on the regular Evening MBA 6:00 - 9:30 pm class schedule.

The agenda items I have for this round of pizza dinners include:
(1) Discussion of international elective
(2) Elective offerings for Spring 01

If you have other agenda items, please let me know.

Please mark your calendars -  the pizza will be hot and the sodas cold (or
vice
versa!).   I hope you can make it.  (Please attend only those dinners for
which you are scheduled. Thank you for your cooperation!)



Please Note:  For those of you taking electives, if you have an exam on the
night of one of the pizza nights, just come to the pizza night for your
other elective.
