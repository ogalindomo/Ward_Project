Beginning tomorrow, we will be using a different bridge line number.  The 
reason for this being that AT&T offers Enron a lower rate of $.19/cents a 
minute vs. $.24/cents a minute.   In order to access the bridge line you will 
use the following numbers:

Toll Free Dial in Number:  (888) 422-7141

International Access/Caller Paid Dial in Number:  (334) 832-4208

Host Code:  203099 (you will be accessing as a host versus participant in 
order to have access to the bridge line).

As usual, if you need to reserve the bridge line, please let me know.  Thanks.
