We are missing:

Positive spin at front
Governor Davis is committed to solving the California energy crisis by:
Developing consumer driven solutions
Protecting customers from short term market aberrations
Continuing to expand the consumers ability to choose
We are missing thoughtful Orderly Process
Maintain 1890 in interim
All customers treated the same
Would replace "maintain a reliable distribution network" with "assure 
investment community"
Assurances around forward purchases
Assurances around prudent purchases to keep lights
Assurances, if needed through increases, via tax refundable.
Maintain AB1890 until orderly process arrives with better solution
Would drop specifics arount rate increase. 

More to come......
