Attached is the draft of ENA/EES comments to be filed Thursday in the 
proceeding on the complaint filed by various producers, the CPUC, SoCal Gas, 
and SoCal Edison against El Paso Natural Gas, alleging that El Paso has 
oversold its system and that full requirements contracts should be converted 
to CD.  Our comments agree with the complainants, illustrated by EES 
experiences with Southwest Gas this past winter.

If you have any comments or questions about this filing, please let me or 
Leslie know by close of business (5:00 pm CDT) tomorrow.
