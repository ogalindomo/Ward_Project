Good evening all: 

Attached are (1) a revised clean draft of our ongoing briefing outline and 
(2) a redlined version of the outline.? A few notes: 

I have not yet prepared Appendix A, the definition of Net Undercollected 
Amount.? It would be useful for Ann to make sure that the defined term in the 
MOU still works in this context.? Ann, would you please put together the 
Appendix for inclusion?

Jeff Dasovich has committed to providing a criterion for determining when the 
retail market is viable.? This is a very important issue both to large 
customers and, I would assume, to ESPs.? We look forward to hearing from Jeff 
on Monday on this point.

We have no new information from the "coming and going" subcommittee, but look 
forward to including that information when available.

Customers (perhaps both large and small) would be well served to get together 
to talk about the Interim Rate Relief section.? I'm not sure whether I've 
fairly captured the discussions (or whether the discussions were clear enough 
to capture).? At a minimum, this effort should move us one step closer to 
identifying the competing proposals.

Enjoy your weekend!
