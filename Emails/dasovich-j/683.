Steve -- great guidance.
Cynthia -- hope we're in time.
Jeff -- the fifth paragraph has some supply/demand figures for the early part 
of this week that I heard but can't track down the written source. Any 
suggestions?

Please review and don't hesitate to call me this weekend. Best bet is home 
number -- 914-736-9504 or cell phone -- 914-318-1568.
