Hello Everybody,

Here are my notes from our meeting last week.  I've marked them "draft" in 
case I've missed anything.  Please take a few minutes to review them before 
tomorrow's meeting, so that we can be sure we're all starting from the same 
point.  

We'll be meeting on the 47th floor in the same room as last time.  Also, 
lunch will be provided.  (In direct response to the grumbling last week!)

Thanks,

Sue
