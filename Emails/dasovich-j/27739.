Rob and I can definitely make the BBQ. I am so glad that Oscar is happy.

let us know your schedule and the location details when you have a
chance.

Thanks!

Subject: It's time for a BBQ!


Hello all, I am having a bbq on Saturday, June 23 at 5:00. It is byob
your own something to barbecue. It is the weekend of the Sonoma County
Fair so those who want to - we can go check out the fair after. Please
respond. Hope everyone will be around it will be great to see
everyone.   kari

ps I galloped Oscar around the trails today and he was very happy. He
thinks he has died and gone to horse heaven! Everyone has to come and
visit him and we can gallop around the trails.
