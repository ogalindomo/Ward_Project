The link to the homework solutions from my web page was screwed up
yesterday.  I have corrected the problem.  Madhur did email you the correct
link right after the TA session, as well as the solutions themselves, so I
hope this made access possible.  If not, I apologize for the delay, I hope
it did not cause too much inconvenience for you.  In the future all solution
will be available just after the TA session on Saturdays.

A few other things:

1)  The quizzes (and solutions) are all available for the semester.  Dont
forget to use them to gauge your understanding of the fundamental concepts.

2) FAQs are available for all the important concepts in the first two weeks.
If you are unsure of any, check them out!

3) I have had only two volunteers for class reps.  As an added inducement to
voluteer, if you do, I promise to buy you a beer AFTER the final exam!
