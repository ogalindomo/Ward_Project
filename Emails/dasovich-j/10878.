Let's try this one more time.  How 'bout 3:00 p.m. CDT?  Susan and I will 
initiate the call.  Thanks.  By the way, we got your outline and it looked 
great.  I'm trying to get started on condensing it into something we'd feel 
comfortable leaving behind.  Good work, Mark.

Subject: Conference Call

Jeff, just checking in. Do we have another time for a conference call ? Any
feedback to my Email of topics and positions ? I just read Socal's comments
concerning storage and a potential change of service priority for the EGs.
Socal is recommending an adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement, notes
their proactive system enhancements at Needles, L85 , Wheeler Ridge and
Storage and still suggest that they can handle the anticipated system
demands. Please contact me when you get a break. Mark, IGS
