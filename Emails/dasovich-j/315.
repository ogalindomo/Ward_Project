Apparently, the attached syllabus expanded and was gibberish for many of
you. If you don't receive it this time, you can stop by the office and pick
up a copy. I will also forward a .pdf file with the reading for next week.

Resend:

Attached is the syllabus for E248. Professor Hartman will let us know if
there is material to prepare for next week, and we will let you know. I
thought it would be helpful for some of you that are interested in the
content to see the syllabus in the meantime.
