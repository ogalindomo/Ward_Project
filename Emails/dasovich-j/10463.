Message from Rick:

The Campaign Leadership Call, which takes place daily at 4:30pm CST, is 
"Mandatory".  If you are unable to attend, it will be necessary for you to 
have someone participate on the call in your behalf.  Please notify Rick or 
myself,  if you are unable to participate and let us know who will be 
participating for you.  A fine of $25.00 will be assessed to those who do not 
participate or have someone participate for them.  The monies collected will 
go to a charity of the group's choice.

Thanks and please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
