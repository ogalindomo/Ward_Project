A couple of points to clarify - You'll still have Notes available with your=
=20
old mail retained.  You'll be able to look at messages and open attachments=
,=20
but you will not be able to move messages into or out of folders, nor forwa=
rd=20
any messages.  Also, you'll still be able to access Notes databases,=20
including Project Tracking and RCRs.  Project Tracking is being converted t=
o=20
a web-based database, and as we get closer to implementation I'll distribut=
e=20
further information.

We've learned that the San Francisco, Portland and DC offices are being=20
converted separately.  Please contact your office manager for details.

Thanks!
