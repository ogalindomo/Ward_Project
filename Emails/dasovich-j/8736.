Attached is IEP's draft legislative language pertaining to QFs and amending
Section 390.  This will be the focus of the conference call previously
scheduled for 5:00 a.m. today, Tuesday.

In addition, the legislature's select energy committee reconvened at 3:30
p.m. today to discuss 1x and 18x.  To the extent we have anything to report,
we will report during the conference call.
