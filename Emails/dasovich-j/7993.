RE:? Year 2001 Membership
?
?
This past year the energy business was  characterized by turmoil, chaos, and 
abundent activity.? The Year 2001  promises to be just as lively.?? 
?
IEP is proud of the?record of success we have  achieved representing energy 
producers and traders.?? This past year,  we developed and implemented a 
project to respond to inaccurate and all too  often misleading reports in the 
press and elsewhere regarding the Californnia  marketplace.? On the 
regulatory front, we?intervened at FERC on market  structure issues, and FERC 
has quoted our filings during their deliberations; we  have defended the 
sanctity of QF contracts and the AB1890 "deal" in the face of  mounting 
pressure; and we have pushed aggressively for continuing support for  
existing renewables as well as implementing state programs that will incent 
the  timely introduction of new renewables.
?
The Year 2001 will be particularly important for  our industry as the 
California legisature addresses new energy legislation; the  CPUC and FERC 
move to solve QF/SRAC and market strucuture matters; and the CEC  engages a 
new OII on generation siting.??We hope that you all continue  to support 
these critical activities by renewing your membership and actively  engaging 
in the IEP deliberation of these matters.? At this point in time,  the IEP 
Board has not determined that an increase in dues for the upcoming year  is 
necessary; therefore, you will be receiving an invoice in the very near  
future for Year 2001 dues which will be at the same level as last year.?  
Please respond promptly to this invoice, as the funding will enable IEP to 
make  a smooth transition to the new year.? 
?
If you have any questions, concerns, or wish to  change your membership 
level, please contact IEP as soon as possible.?  Thank you for your prompt 
attention to this  matter.?
