Hello!

As many of you already know, I have left Gunderson Dettmer to pursue other
"non-legal" opportunities!!  I am joining an internet start-up (how unique)
as VP of Business Development.  Although the site hasn't launched yet, the
URL is iwanto.com.  I'll tell you all about it later when things settle down
a bit.

**MY EMAIL ADDRESS (csellers@gunder.com <mailto:csellers@gunder.com> ) WILL
NO LONGER BE ACTIVE STARTING NOVEMBER 8 (MONDAY)**

My email address for the next three weeks is camsell@pacbell.net
<mailto:camsell@pacbell.net> , but I leave for Cuba tomorrow and will not be
back until November 25th.

Starting on November 29th, my email address will be cameron@iwanto.com
<mailto:cameron@iwanto.com>
