Thanks for signing up for the Syrah tasting next Tuesday night. We are 
already over the attendance limit which is 50 because of the limited wine 
available for this tasting. Diane is looking for a larger room to accommodate 
more people.

So now I really do have to use Crystal Ball! I was just kidding originally. 
Those who have signed up already will have a higher probability of making the 
list: the sign-up cut-off is Friday. Those who do not make the initial list 
are welcome to try to come on Tuesday night because people ALWAYS forget 
about these things on the day of the event, AND you will have 1st priority 
for the Evening Wine Break next semester.

I will send out a list on Monday. I apologize for having to limit the 
attendance. L
