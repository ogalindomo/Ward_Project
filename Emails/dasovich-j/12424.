We better run this one up the Enron Washington flagpole.   It conflicts with
what we are doing to a certain extent as it establishes a schedule for
allowing customers to switch when we are advocating allowing all customers
to switch at the same time.  There probably needs to be some merging of this
concept and the DA coalition langauge (without all the detail and simply
affirming customers' right to switch).  I can put it together if asked to do
so.  Mike
