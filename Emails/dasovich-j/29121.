Additional information on the FERC hearing today:
Commissioners asked FERC staff on what basis the Commission could take 
remedial action -- prior to October 2, 2000 -- for the withholding of 
generating capacity by market participants. Unless the Commission can find 
violations of tariff provisions, contracts or market rules, FERC's hands are 
tied, according to Deputy General Counsel Cynthia Marlette.
All of the commissioners voted for the order, Commissioners Massey and 
Breathitt will dissent in part concerning the decision to extend refund 
liability to non-public utilities in the California market. Commissioner 
Massey said that while he agrees with the "equity argument" for requiring 
non-public utilities to pay refunds, he does not believe the Commission has 
any legal basis to do so. 
Attached is a release just issued by FERC on today's meeting.
