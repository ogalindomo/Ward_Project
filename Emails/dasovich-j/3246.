How lame is this e-mail...

(Did you complain about being on my team??)

Where are we meeting tonight?  I think I may have your case study...I have
someone's.

See you tonight,
Jackie

Jackie,

We have changed your team assignment for the Mid Program Academic 
Retreat.  You were assigned to Atlantic 5, but that team had more members 
than any other and we needed to reshuffle to achieve some parity.

You are now assigned to Atlantic 4.

This means that your Pre-Meeting will occur on Tuesday, and not Wednesday.

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns that 
you may have.

Thank you,

Meg St. John
Assistant Director, Evening MBA Program
(510) 527-1406
