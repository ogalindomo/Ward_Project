		 Subject: Direct Access op-ed in LA Daily News


Hello DA Coalition,

Great News - the Los Angeles Daily News has published the direct access
op-ed we submitted. The piece was authored by Marriott Hotels, a Strategic
Energy DA customer, and is attached below for those of you who haven't yet
seen it. It ran in Tuesday's edition of the paper.

This hit is extremely well placed given that a majority of the publication's
readership is actually in Bob Hertzberg's district.

Edelman is pushing forward with this op-ed and will keep you posted about
our progress with other publications.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. EM.
