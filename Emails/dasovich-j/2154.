Dear Students,

Haas Computing Services (HCS) is conducting a survey for students involved
in the Infopier course management system pilot for the fall semester.  Your
feedback will help to evaluate the pilot for future expansion.  This survey
is intended only for those students enrolled in courses using Infopier.

The link below will take you to the page where the survey is located.  There
will be a authentication screen that opens when you click on the link.  The
name and password required to login is your Haas domain login.

Thank you in advance for you participation.
