I am looking forward to meeting you all next week.  In the mean time there
are few things that I want to alert you to:

1)  The course web page can be found at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~berk/teaching/E203/E203.html

It is still under construction, so please wait for the syllabus handed out
during the first lecture before finalizing plans.

2) The Monday class on labor day will be made up on the following Saturday,
or you are welcome to come to Tuesday's lecture that week.  See the syllabus
for details.

3) If you do decide to download the lecture notes, please not the caveat at
the top of the web page.

Professor Jonathan Berk
