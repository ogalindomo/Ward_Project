I pulled the recent forward curves (confidential; not for external release 
without approval from West Power) and computed the stranded costs associated 
with the DWR contracts.  Assuming SP15 on peak (which is conservative since 
many of the contracts had off peak energy in them) the total overmarket is 
$21 billion, or $13 billion discounted at 12%.  The former number is most 
comparable to the $40+ billion DWR expenditure commitement number.

If we want to use this for any sort of external message I would like to 
refine further.
