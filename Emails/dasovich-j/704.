In error the attachment suggests the paper is final and an Enron position. 
Note that this is a draft for a position to be taken by the European 
Federation of Energy Traders on 14 September. There will be amendments. Until 
then the document should not be circulated outside the company. Kyran Hanks 
in London or Nailia Dindarova in Brussels can let anyone interested have 
final version as of around 11 September. 
Thanks.      
              Peter Styles,
              Head of Enron Delegation to 
              the European Union,
              Brussels.
