KEY MESSAGES

Generators have been operating under the rules California established for i=
ts=20
electricity market. ?We did not create the market, nor did we write the=20
rules. ?In fact, the "big five" generators did not come to California until
AB 1890 invited them into the state, where they?ve since invested billions =
of=20
dollars buying, building and modernizing power plants.

=01. Energy companies, independent financial analysts and IEP warned that t=
he=20
PUC was failing to implement AB 1890 properly, and that the market was bein=
g=20
set up to fail, especially the residential market.
=01. Last summer, generators were urging and offering long-term contacts. T=
hey=20
were flatly rejected. ?Had they been adopted, the crisis could have been=20
prevented or its severity dramatically lessened.
=01. This crisis was caused by three things =01. the failure to enter into=
=20
long-term contracts, forcing an over-reliance on the spot market; a supply=
=20
shortage, and no retail market. ?The market can be fixed. ?It should not be=
=20
abandoned.

We?re an important part of the solution.

=01. We?ve made extraordinary efforts to keep our plants running during thi=

nd=20
regulatory efforts to end the crisis.=20

dollars to buy, modernize and build new power plants in California =01. to=

generate electricity for California.
=01. Our new and upgraded power plants will help improve California?s air=

quality and generate power more efficiently.

We?re hopeful that these hearing focus on facts, fairness and accountabilit=
y.

=01. "Witch hunts," "scape-goating" and sensational headlines won?t solve t=

problem or end the crisis.
