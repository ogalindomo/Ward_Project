I have found a mistake in AS #7, on problem 4, parts f and g.  The MR
function is wrong which messes up the answers for the rest of the problem.
I apologize for missing this.  I sincerely hope, however, that you caught
this mistake in doing the problems.  At this point, such a mistake should
be quite noticeable.  I have included the correction in an attached word
file. Sorry this is so late.
