We've heard from WSPA that Bowen may take up her direct access bill on
Monday in its present form.  The coalition members have submitted many
forms of language to her office, but it is believed she is pressing
ahead with her version giving the PUC control over this issue.  Kelly's
direct access bill will remain in a form supported by the coalition, but
is not expected to move through Bowen's committee.

The Republicans are coming out with a 5 bill package next week to
include:  direct access (coalition language), siting, conservation (with
a tax credit), 8 hour day, and blackout protocol.  They'll be introduced
in the second special session with accompanying press conference.
