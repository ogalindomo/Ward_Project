Not good news from Canada.  Power lines are full when appropriate.  Just 
Powerex's power.

Subject: Re: PROOF OF ALBERTA POWER NOT FLOWING TO CALIFORNIA  

I spoke to Ray Alvarez about this today.  British Columbia Hydro has a FERC 
888 Wholesale Transmission Tariff in place and the actual available 
transmission capacity is primarily owned by B.C. Hydro's marketing affiliate, 
Powerex, with some small amounts of interruptible capacity owned off and on 
by other market participants, including Enron.  

Although Enron Canada would like to export more power to the US as we can 
supply it from our PPA or even buy it in Alberta's Power Pool, there is 
rarely any available transmission capacity as what is available was fully 
subscribed for (mainly by Powerex) and is used.  I just confirmed with our 
trader that none of BC Hydro's transmission export capacity has gone unused 
when Alberta or BC had excess generation available for export and the 
economics of selling from Alberta or BC into Mid-C were favorable.    

Regards,

Rob

Rob -

Is there any information that would highlight that Alberta had excess 
generation that couldn't get into the California market this year or later?

I need this ASAP.
