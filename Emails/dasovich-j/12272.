House Panel Rejects Pwr Price Caps For Calif, West
Updated: Thursday, May 10, 2001 01:04 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. House, Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee 
Thursday rejected an effort to amend an electricity relief bill for 
California and Western states to require cost-based price caps.

The subcommittee voted 20-12 to reject an amendment offered by Rep Henry 
Waxman, D-Calif, which borrowed price-cap language from a Senate bill 
sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, and Gordon Smith, D-Ore..

All Republican members voted against the measure, and were joined by two 
Democrats, Ralph Hall of Texas, and Christopher John of Louisiana.

Three California Republicans joined their colleagues in voting against the 
amendment; Mary Bono, George Radanovich and Christopher Cox.

The subcommittee continues to debate the overall measure and is expected to 
vote for final passage later in the day.
