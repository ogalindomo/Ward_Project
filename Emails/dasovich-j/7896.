RE: MYTHS VS FACTS

In response to Andy Brown's suggestion for additional fact sheets, I am
working on a "Myths vs Facts" paper and would like your recommendations (I'm
going to leave the gas issues fact sheet to someone else).  Because we
already have a general restructuring and IEP solutions Frequently Asked
Questions being finalized, this fact sheet should focus on those persistent
myths that don't help us or the restructuring cause generally.

Attached is my top "myths" list.  Please take some time to give me what your
top 10 "myths" are, and if you have time, include what points we need to hit
on in the "Facts."

THANKS.
