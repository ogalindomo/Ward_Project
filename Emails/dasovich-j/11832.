Scott, will you send Alan our letter of opposition and be sure to copy me so 
I can archive a final copy with the changes we made?  Alan, if you have any 
other questions, you should follow up with Scott or Mike Day.  thanks.

Subject: Windfal Profits Tax  

Scott, Janel:

I am getting questions from commercial folks re: the proposed profit tax.   
Could you copy me on the letter or memo on Enron's position that has been 
prepared?  Also if we have done any analysis on its legality 
(constitutionality) I would like to see (Mike Day memo perhaps?).

(I apologize if you have already circulated something on this as I may not 
have read it.)

Thanks,

Alan
