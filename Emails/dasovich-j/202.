These are the notes from Saturday's section. Note, diagrams in the Word
6 version will not appear correctly.  Congratulations to those of you

I am also attaching an article from the Wall Street Journal on Argentina
which does a better job integrating the idea of the risk premium on
policy, as I discussed in section.
