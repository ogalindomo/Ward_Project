Jeff,

Here's the URL with passwords:

UserName:  MARKET (all caps)
Password:  MAKER (all caps)

Demo Script:
In step 1, choose:

Category:  Television
Subcategory:  Commercial
Profile:  Gen X (this selection combo will yield the greatest functionality
from the demo environment)

Within Gen X you can adjust the first six sliders to specifically weight the
attributes.

You can also choose "more requirements" to specify even more attributes and
weights, as well as, edit the ranges of those attributes.

When you click go, the system is running our algorithm and will display
"dynamically" who is competing and then show you the results.

That's basically it.  Alot of the other features and functionality are still
"in development".

Be aware that this demo is totally confidential and should not be shared
with anyone other than your team.

Take care,

Mike D.

Good morning:

Would it be possible for either of you to send us the URL (or whatever it
takes) to access the RFQ demo?  Thanks and have a nice holiday.

Best,
Jeff
