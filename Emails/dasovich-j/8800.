Good News.  FERC issued three reports yesterday:  a Response of the Staff of 
the FERC to Questions Posed at December 20, 2000 Western Governors 
Association Denver Meeting; a Staff Report to the FERC on Northwest Power 
Markets in Nov. and Dec. 2000; and a Report on Plant Outages in the State of 
California.  All three reports can be downloaded from FERC's page on bulk 
power markets, found at http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm.

From a quick scan of the pricing and outage reports, the results are very 
favorable.  FERC found no evidence that plants were down for other than 
maintenance or emissions problems.  The pricing report found that prices in 
the NW during the two months tracked the increased demand and supply 
shortfall.
