Dear Evening Students,
I want to alert you to a resource that we offer which, unlike the other
databases that we subscribe to, uses ID's and Passwords.

The Onesource (http://www.Onesource.com )
database will be an excellent site for conducting company and industry
research because it allows you to create, with a single search, a document
that contains company and industry financial data in Excel format, industry
trend studies, analyst's reports, links to competitors, current news and
trade publication articles, and other important information.  To use
Onesource:

Connect to www.Onesource.com

Click on "Subscriber Log-on" located at the top of the screen.

Click on "Registered User?"

Type in your Haas email username and attach .ucb in both the ID and
Password boxes.  (E.g. if your email username is fjones, you would type in
fjones.ucb in both boxes.)

Once you are connected, use the "Account Maintenance" connection on the
bottom of the page and reset your password to a more secure word.  Please
note that it is very important to change your password as soon as possible
and to use a word that you will remember.

If you forget your password, you can click on the "Forgotten your User ID or
password?" link on the Subscriber Log-On screen to have Onesource email
information that will allow you to reconnect again.

Also, please note that you can always use the "Electronic Resources" menu
on the Long Library homepage ( http://library.berkeley.edu/BUSI/ ) to find
out what other resources are available.
