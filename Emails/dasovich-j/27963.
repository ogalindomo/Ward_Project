Good evening:

Attached is a redline draft reflecting our discussions today and inserts
received from John White (New Sections 7, 9 & !0) and Ann Cohn (Appendix
A) during the day.  The redline shows new material added this morning;
the strikeout shows deletions from the 061801 draft.

The Large Customer coalition will present revisions to Sections 4 & 8
tomorrow morning.

See you in the morning.

Evie
