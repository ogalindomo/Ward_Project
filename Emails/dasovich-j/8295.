IEP has scheduled a conference call with the  Restructuring/Transmission Task 
Force or 11:00 a.m. on Friday, January  12?? The purpose of the call will be 
to discuss generation siting  issues.? 
?
The Call-In Number is???  ??? ??? 888/271-0949
The Participant Code  is??????????134916

Background
As the legislature gears up for its Emergency  Session, legislators are 
requesting input from IEP on legislative language  which would help siting 
issues.? Attached is a background paper from  Julee Malinowski-Ball, 
Edson&Modisette related to this issues.? It  includes another attachment 
which was a document developed by IEP  approximately six months ago related 
to key issues.? On Thursday, IEP  will circulate draft legislative language 
addressing the following issues  raised in the Edson&Modisette memo (Note, we 
are not planning on tackling  all the issues raised in the memo in the 
legislature.? Some require a CEC  administrative "fix"):
?

Give Deference To Other State and Regional  Agencies/Eliminate Overlapping 
Jurisdiction  
Consider Positive Environmental and Reliability  Impacts of Projects  
Ease Communication Between Applicants and  Staff  
Permit Local Agencies to Make Zoning Changes or  Other Decisions for Power 
Plants Contingent on CEC CEQA  Compliance

In addition to the above, CEC Commissioner Laurie  (Head of the Siting 
Committee) is convening a workshop on January 25 to begin  an OII on siting 
issues.? An OII is an informational proceeding.?  The Commissioner would like 
to provide the legislature with a Report by April  2001.??? The Report will 
focus on "critical issues affecting  the Commission's ability to license 
powerplants and related  facilities..."? Issues will include availability of 
emission offsets,  water supply, transmission line constraints, natural gas 
supply constraints,  local agency and public opposition, land use 
constraints, and problems with  the timing of federal permits.? The 
Commissioner clearly wants to look at  40,000 foot, multi-jurisdictional 
issues.
?
In addition to discussing the importance of the  above mentioned matters, the 
conference call will provide a forum to identify  and discuss additional 
issues that need to be placed before the  Commission.
