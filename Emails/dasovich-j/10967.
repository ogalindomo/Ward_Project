We definitely need to see the paperwork since we already paid a bill of at
least that much so far.  Don't worry, though we will make sure that you
don't get stuck with anything and work it all out.

Hi.  I've got all the paperwork.  The bill (on my bill) for you guys is
$740.  I'll get you the paperwork tonite.  Sorry for the mix-up  (should I
ask Squaw for a discount due to all the mess!?!?).

Best,
Jeff
