Well it appears that Jimmy is the only one with too much time on his
hands.  Anyway, I am at home today and got to my part.  It is
attached.  Please let me know if you feel I should add anything.  I am
leaving very early Sunday morning to go on a business trip for the week.  I
will not be in class Monday or Tuesday and do not get back to the Bay area
until Saturday.  I will be checking my email so let me know what I need to
do for the next case.

Thanks for taking responsibility for this case Jeff.
