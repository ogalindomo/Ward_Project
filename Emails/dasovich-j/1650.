I'll see you next week.? I start on Monday and I have a CPAG presentation to 
do on Thursday.? It should be entertaining if nothing else.? Yes, I'm 
excited.? Looks like I'll be focused on gas initially, then some electric.? 
I'll have? better idea next week.? Give me a week to settle in and we can do 
lunch and catch up.
