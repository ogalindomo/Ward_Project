Attached is a revised version of Mike Day's draft of Part 4 of the
legislative package, on expedited permitting of new and expanded electric
generating capacity.  I have tried to incorporate the thoughtful comments
provided to me by Sam Wehn of ENA and Barry Ogilby of McCutcheon (outside
counsel).  Since Mike will soon be off on a family vacation, please direct
any comments or questions to me at 415-765-8413 or bcragg@gmssr.com.
