ANNOUNCING THE SPRING EVMBA WRITING WORKSHOP  -- March 3, 2001 -- 10:00 - 5:00
_________________________

Are you an adequate writer? In today's competitive business world, that's
not good enough! On Saturday, March 3 I'll lead a not-for-credit workshop
to help you write more effectively and pass the writing requirement with
ease.

(Passed the requirement but still want more writing tips? This workshop is
designed for ALL Evening MBA students interested in improving their
business writing skills.)

Through lecture and hands-on activities, you will learn techniques for
getting your messages across clearly, persuasively, and swiftly.
Topics include:
* Moving from ideas to final draft without getting "blocked"
* Writing effective introductions and solid arguments
* Revising for concise, concrete, and active language
* Avoiding problems with tense and time
* Common punctuation problems and solutions

...and, if we have time and enough interest...
* Writing effective email

The workshop will be held from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sign-up in the Evening MBA
Program office.  We will let you know the room number for the workshop in
an e-mail reminder.  If you have additional questions, please feel free to
contact me.  I look forward to seeing you there!
