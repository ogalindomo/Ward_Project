Subject: CAISO Notice - Market Stabilization Proposal - Conference Call

                ISO Market Participants:
                The ISO has developed a market stabilization plan, designed
to stabilize operations and control costs in California, to be implemented
in the next two months.  It would remain in place for the near term (through
Summer, 2001 and beyond) and includes changes to existing ISO practices as
well as an expansion of the ISO's responsibilities.  Because of the need to
move quickly so that the plan can be implemented by this summer, we will be
unable to hold a full stakeholder review process.  But, we do want to
discuss the plan with you so that you can understand the proposal and the
reasoning behind it.
                The ISO will post this plan on the ISO web site at
http://www.caiso.com/stakeholders/ <http://www.caiso.com/stakeholders/> , by
COB tomorrow.  In addition, we will host a conference call from 10:00 a.m.
to 2:00 p.m. PST this Friday, March 9, to discuss the plan with you and
clarify any outstanding issues.  We then plan to request the Board's
approval for this plan on March 15th in order to be able to implement the
plan by summer.
                The call in information is as follows:
                Market Stabilization Conference Call
                Friday, March 9, 10:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. PST
                Call-In Number:         877-381-6005
                Conference ID #:        760357
                Leader Name:    Byron Woertz
                Following the call, you may submit any comments on the plan
to us by close of business on Tuesday, March 13.  You may send your comments
to bwoertz@caiso.com.  We will do our best to summarize your comments and
present them to the Board at their March 15 meeting. In addition, there will
be a public comment period on the 15th.
                Please contact me if you have any further questions.
