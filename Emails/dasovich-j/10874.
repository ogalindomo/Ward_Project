Jeff:

Robert and I wanted to follow up with you on your question about savings that 
could be realized if 10% of lg. C&Is found other energy suppliers.
Please provide a bit more info. about what you are interested in:

*Would it be a subtraction of 10% of C&I load or customers?
*How precise do we need to be, i.e., can I estimate figures based on 1999 
load?

It is probably best to reply via e-mail.

Thanks, Jennifer
