An invitation to ALL EvMBA students:

Learn how YOU can benefit from the online community.

The moment we entered Haas, we became part of a worldwide community of
students, faculty and alumni. Come and join the Haas Alumni Relations
office for a presentation on the Online Community, a powerful tool provided
by the Haas Alumni Network (HAN) to reach a broad network of Haas friends.
Possible uses?? Think job hunting, class project, find old class-mates....

The Online Community will be introduced next week to all EvMBA students
during two
