Bush Says California Must Resolve Power Crisis, Sen. Reid Says
1/24/1 10:51 (New York)


     (For more on California's electricity crisis, see {EXTRA
<GO>.})

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
said California can't look to federal help after the expiration in
two weeks of two emergency orders requiring power providers and
natural gas suppliers to sell into California, Senator Harry Reid
said.
     ``He indicated that the two-week extension was the last,''
Reid told reporters after he and other congressional leaders met
with Bush.
     ``California's problems are lapping over into other states,''
said Reid, a Democrat who represents neighboring Nevada. Bush
``indicated it was a problem that California had to solve for
itself.''
     U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday he
extended the Clinton administration's orders to give California's
lawmakers time to make policy changes needed to resolve the
state's energy supply problems. The orders were extended through
Feb. 6.
     After that, California must make its own arrangements with
out-of-state energy suppliers and no extension will be granted,
Abraham said. California Governor Gray Davis, who requested the
extension, agreed with Abraham that no further extensions will be
necessary, the Energy Department said.
