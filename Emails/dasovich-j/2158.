		 Subject: Competition PR Strategy Update

So that we continue to drive our activities with our Public Affairs strategy, 
we have asked Alhamd to coordinate our material and project timeline.  We are 
also asking Jeanie Mandelker to take the lead in working through our 
different material to put into one look and feel.  

Please let Alhamd know of your activities so that we are able to better 
coordinate any bottlenecks.  Also, please forward to Alhamd and Jeanie all 
prior work that has been done so that they are in the loop.

Attached the original gameplan.

Jim
