Hi Guys,

In a desperate move to ensure adequate responses, I am
calling on you to take our mktg research class survey on
PC usage. I promise it will take only 5-7 minutes out of
your busy day! You may even win the Handspring Visor
we're giving away :-)

Here's the link:

And please do feel absolutely free to forward around...

Cheers!
-Anil
