? Item 5b of the PUC draft decision, which implements the 3 cent/kwh rate 
increase, has just passed unanimously. Commissioner Lynch stressed again that 
this rate increase can only be used by the utilities for power purchases 
going forward with the only exception being that the utilities must pay the 
state the money they owe for the power purchased by the DWR.

? The tiered rate structure was not debated or voted upon.  Lynch said that 
this cannot be decided until the rate structure is complete and the committee 
would work on this issue on an "expedited basis," approximately 30 days.

? Commissioners Brown and Wood explicitly thanked Lynch for taking courageous 
leadership in spearheading this decision.
