He just left.

He's staying at the Regal Biltmore.  The fax # there is:  213-612-1628

Phone #:  213-624-1011 (in case you need to call him).

He lands tonight LAX at 5:31 p.m. on Continental # 1948.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Linda:
I will have the California update done for Steve today.  Maureen, could I 
possibly get the fax # where Steve will be staying this evening in the event 
that I need to fax it to him directly?  What time will he be leaving for LA?  
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
