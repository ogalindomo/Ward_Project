Hi All,

Calpine appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed amendments to
AB 1X.  The proposed amendment would delete language now in section 80110
which provides:  "The department shall have the same rights with respect to
the payment by retail end use customers for power sold by the department as
do providers of power to such customers."

That language is extremely useful for maintaining that the department may
directly bill customers if, for example, the CPUC does not adopt a
sufficient rate recovery mechanism.   It is very important to use that we
keep that language intact.  I don't believe this should be a problem for any
of you but please call me at (916) 443-2500 if it is.  Thank you.
