Hi everyone - 

I am not one for good-byes - so I will say - See you all later - 

It really has been too short but sweet - I have enjoyed meeting and working 
with all of you - and I am sure that our paths will cross in the future - 

Please feel free to call me at home (408) 970-8673 or on my cell (415) 
806-7953 - if you need to see some sun in the valley or just to bug me about 
my projects - or to grab a margarita (cannot get the Houston out of me) 
..........

Cheers All - 
GAURI
