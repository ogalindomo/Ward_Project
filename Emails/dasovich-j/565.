I put together some draft talking points for Hydro Presentation to be used in 
soliciting support for action on valuation of PG&E's Hydro Assets.  Jeff, 
Roger and I will be meeting in the small conference room after the staff 
meeting at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.  All are welcome.  Feel free to comment on 
attached.  We will circulate further drafts for review by group.
