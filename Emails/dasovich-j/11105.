Attached for your review and comment is the proposed TW handout for the CPUC 
workshop on gas infrastructure on Tues. April 17.  I've been told by the 
Energy Division staff that with the significant amount of data they're 
expecting to receive during the workshop and with the expected 
interest/participation, Transwestern may not have an opportunity to speak.  
However, they have encouraged us to produce any handouts we'd like to 
distribute on Tuesday.

Since I'm out of the office on Monday, please call me and leave me a voice 
mail message indicating whether changes or modifications to the handout are 
needed.  If so, please return email your changes and I'll stop by Monday 
before I leave and incorporate them into the handout.  If not, I'll ask 
Audrey to prepare approx. 80 copies that I'll pick-up on my way to the 
airport Monday p.m.  Thank you.
