Goodmorning!  Just wanted to let you know that I talked with Steffes last 
night and he said to pull as much together by 3:00 today so that Steve can 
review over the weekend (whether documents are complete or not).  Just give 
me what you haave by 3:00 today.  Also, I am including 3 reports (BAEF, and 
two CERA reports) into the book.  Call if you have questions.
