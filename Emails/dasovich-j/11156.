On Thursday, April 12th, I forwarded to you a series of Advice filings which
SCE made on April 11.  The attached document summarizes those filings.
While two the three appear to be fairly innocuous, one (1534-E) apparently
starts the process of implementing the MOU with the governor.  Please pay
careful attention to your review of that advice. If we are to protest, such
protest would be due on May 1.
