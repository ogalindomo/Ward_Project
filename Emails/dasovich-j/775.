Attached is my version of the next draft of Enron's key Message Points.  I 
wrote these after watching two focus groups held in Orange County, CA 
Wednesday and Thursday night.

It is important to note that the staff from Luntz Research (Liz VanDersarl) 
is also re-writing the key Message Points and the Speeches for our review on 
Monday.  Their version will most likely be different than these.

If anyone has any comments on this version, please let me know so I can pass 
it on to Luntz Research.

Thanks.

Jim
