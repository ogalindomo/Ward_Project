ARM is looking at hiring a PR firm.  In talking to Ray McNally today re ARM, 
he discussed some recent polling data they had seen for San Diego.  Here are 
the highlights.

Everyone is well aware of the energy price issue
Everyone is angry
Everyone is blaming Steve Peace
Everyone also thinks SDG&E is to blame -- that the utility is gouging
People are supportive of a competitive energy market
People don't buy the argument that reregulation will help consumers
People are OK with having caps until more generation comes on line
AND people will settle for reregulation if they can't have competition

His assessment was that Steve Peace's career is over and that the 
administration wants desperately to ensure that this issue goes away by the 
time Davis has to run for re-election in two years.
