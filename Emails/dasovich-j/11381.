Hey guys.  Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California?  In 
particular, a guy by the name of  John Stout or a woman (I think she's PR) 
named Stephanie Newell?  My understanding is that they are shopping a demand 
exchange idea---in particular in Utah.  I would like to contact him in 
preparation for the RGA meeting in Los Angeles, but wanted to check with you 
all first to see what we might already be doing with them.
