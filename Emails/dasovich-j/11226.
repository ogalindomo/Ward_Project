Thank you for your note.  There was a little timing issue of when the email 
went out compared to when the "switch was turned on".  We are in the process 
of moving code now and it should be up within the half hour.  I'm hoping 
you'll enjoy the application.  Let us know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Greetings:
I tried to log in and the system told me that I'm not authorized to use the 
system.
Best,
