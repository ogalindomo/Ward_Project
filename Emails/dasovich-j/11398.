Hey Jeff,

I hope you don't take anything personally when I disagree with you.  You are
a
very bright guy and a good speaker with good ideas.  There are always going
to
be disagreements when you get 4 opinionated people together.  Anyway, please
get
me your numbers by tomorrow so I can spend Tuesday night plugging things in
and
getting the presentation in good working order.  I want Anil to take a final
crack at it Wednesday so everyone can give comments and be done by
Thursdsay.

Thanks.  Could you please send around the model, too?  I want to use for
the financials table.

Best,
Jeff
