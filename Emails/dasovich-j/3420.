Joe, etal --

Given the current state of regulatory risk selling into the CA markets, is 
there any way to move FERC to expedite a process wherein they would 
"predetermine" the information necessary to demonstrate our reasonableness 
(both for under $150/Mwh and over $150/Mwh)?

It seems to me that an Enron only filing will not motivate FERC to act, but 
rather we need WPTF and EPSA (others?) to sign-on to our request for rapid 
treatment.

At a minimum, I need to know the broad outlines of such a filing and the 
procedural steps for this filing by end of business today.  

Also, can we canvas EPSA (Julie Simon) and WPTF (??) to see if any other 
members are thinking about responding to this issue through the trade 
associations.

This is very critical of the desk.
