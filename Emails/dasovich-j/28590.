Hello all,
?
I  made a reservation?at Cleone Gardens Inn, just across the street from the  
ranch.? I reserved a room for Pat, Cal and myself, but was unsure what  other 
reservations to make for the rest of the group because some of you are  still 
tentative and I'm not sure who is bringing SOs/dates.?  
?
The  inn has one room called the Blue Iris room with two double beds that 
might  work for Jeff W. and Jeff D. if going up single; most of their other 
rooms  have a queen or king bed (the Meadow View king room sounded nice for a 
couple  if we have any going up).? Both of those are still?available for the  
weekend we are planning to be there.??I think there  may be some cottages 
available also for multiple people, but I'm not sure what  the configurations 
of those are.? A full breakfast can be ordered from  some of the rooms for 
$14.00 extra.? They serve breakfast at 8:00  a.m.? Pat, Cal and I have a 
suite with a small kitchen, so we may also be  able to host some minimal 
meals/snacks/drinks.? 
?
The  phone number of Cleone Gardens is 1-800-400-2189.? Their website, which  
has pictures and descriptions of their rooms, is cleonegardensinn.com.?  If 
the Cleone Gardens Inn does not have the room configuration you want,  Lari's 
website (horse-vacations.com) has links to numerous other hotels and  B&Bs.
?
Tally ho!
?
Amy

Hi  All: 

Madeleine was kind about me  not keeping up with personal emails .... 


I am putting the Mendocino dates on my calendar. I  would like to ride both 
days. I would also like to stay where everyone will  be happiest ;) 
Howard's Creek is  great, but I agree with Pat, that we just won't have the 
time to enjoy the  place (or breakfast). 

BTW - Are  any non-riders coming?? 

Jeff.
