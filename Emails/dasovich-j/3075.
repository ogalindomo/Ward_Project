I haven't heard anything specifically, but ALJs are supposed to issue their
proposed decisions within 90 days of submission.  Assuming that Phase I was
submitted on the filing of reply briefs, the proposed decison should be out
by this Thursday (Nov. 9).  But this rule isn't strictly enforced, and
Michelle has been very busy in a lot of her proceedings.  I would still
expect the PD shortly (by Thanksgiving, if not sooner).
Hope everything has been going well with you,
Brian

Hi Brian - have you heard anything about when we might expect a proposed
decision on Phase 1 issues from Michelle Cooke.  (Jeff, I'm trying to get
information for Martin Wenzel on DG).
