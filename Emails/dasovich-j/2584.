**DELETE IF NOT THINKING ABOUT GOING ON EXCHANGE NEXT FALL TERM**

We will hold an information session for those of you thinking of going on 
exchange next fall, on Tuesday, October 24th from 12:30 - 2:00 pm in the 
Career Center conference room.

This session gives you a chance to hear about our partner schools from the 
perspective of the exchange students visiting Haas this term. We will also go 
over the selection process and timeline.

Links to our international partner schools, an FAQ, and other helpful 
information is available online at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/MBA/exchangemain_.html

We will also cover our new domestic exchange with Columbia Business School in 
New York City.

Evening MBA students who can't make it to the info session should feel free 
to contact me directly. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Hope to see you there!
