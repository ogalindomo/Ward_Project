Folks,

As promised, the ISO delivered to me today their description of the
super peak energy product.  I have not yet read it yet, but I hope you
do, soon, and send back to me your comments.

Questions of course can be directed to either Nancy or Jim McIntosh.

Drop dead time for your responses is Sunday, at noon.  If you snooze you
loose.
