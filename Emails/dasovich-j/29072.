Hello all, it's that time of year again for Dressage in the Wine
Country. It is Saturday August 25, wine tasting starts at 4:00 and the
performance starts at 7:00. Anyone interested in attending? It is $30
reserved and $20 general. Christine Traurig is going to be part of the
performance (she was on the last Olympic dressage team).  kari
