A team of folks (see attendee list below) will be conducting a California 
planning session next Tuesday and Wednesday.  We would like for you to come 
and spend about 30 to 45 minutes giving them your view of what you think the 
potential is for your area for the California market for the next 0 - 6

the group.  I'll build an agenda based on everyone's feedback.
