Hi Everyone,

This Wednesday, November 1, Dean Tyson will be hosting the second Dean's
Dinner during the 7:30 - 8:15 break.  There's room for 15 people, and it's
a great opportunity to talk with Deans Tyson and Shogan on an informal basis.

Please let me know via e-mail if you're interested in joining us!
First-come, first-served.

Cheers,

Diane
