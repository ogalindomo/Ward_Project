Howdy Team,

Re: Vons part B, what the heck are we supposed to do for Q1 with 
the "Deal Comps" sheet? The sheet I have is blank with some names of 
acquirers and sellers... Is?this supposed to be blank? Is there data on
these specific acquisitions in some other part of the assignment. 

Also, I calculated TEV to sales, and TEV to EBITDA for Safeway
VONS post acquisition. I get values *below* the lower end of the 
range of values of comparables.?Is this way off? What are we 
supposed to make of it... 

Hoping some of you have already worked this out ;-) 

- Confused!

BTW,?did any of you check out this week's HaasWeek? There 
are at least three different write-ups proclaiming how totally
amazing Tasker's class is. She's famous already!
