Dear Evening MBA Students,

Several weeks ago I informed you of changes in access to Stanford's
libraries. Jackson Business Library which is not part of the main Stanford
libraries was not aware of this change because no one at Stanford told them.

Jackson Library has implemented the following temporary procedures for UCB
student access which should remain in place until the end of this term.
As of now, you may use your UCB IDs for entry. If you want to check out any
materials, Jackson Business Library will issue you a separate borrowing
card which will be good through December. We're hoping we will be able to
work out a smoother long-term arrangement with them for next term.

This procedure is only for Jackson Business Library. The main Stanford
libraries will continue to honor your UCB IDs without you requiring an
additional borrowing card.
