PP's Party:? Thank you all so much for wanting us to be a part of the big 
bash.? We can come over Friday night, but need to be back in Napa by 5 pm on 
Saturday for the Mondavi gala.? So we will be there most of the day on 
Saturday.? I presume we'll get directions and times, etc.? Do you want us to 
bring a case of Coastal??? Did you invite Liz Sellers?
