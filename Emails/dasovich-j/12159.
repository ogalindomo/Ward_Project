Re: Training Courses

 This message is sent as a reminder to all employees that there are great 
training opportunities available at Enron and we encourage each of you to 
look at the new InvestinMe program.

 The InvestinMe database is available by going to the Enron intranet home 
page and following these steps:

go to Enron intranet home page
click on itcentral.enron.com
click on services (first time users will need to call the Development Center 
(713-853-0357) for ID and Password)
click on training
click on investinme.enron.com (once there you can search by topic and class 
name to register)

 InvestinMe operates like any other on-line shopping service.  You add 
classes to your shopping cart and check out when you're finished.  At check 
out you will be asked a series of questions about your company number and 
cost center.

 Also, please remember to inform me of classes you have taken, including 
those taken in the last 6 months.  Please include the name of the class and 
the date the course was taken.  As mentioned in the last Government Affairs 
off-site all classes taken which will be considered during the review process.

 Please contact me (713-853-1711) with any comments, questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Eric
