Dear Former TheStreet.com Reader:

Not too long ago, you registered for a free-trial subscription to 
TheStreet.com and you provided us with your email address.  Since then, 
although your free-trial subscription expired, we have occasionally sent you 
promotional emails updating you about changes to our web sites, special 
subscription offers or other news.  In addition, we have from time to time 
sent you emails containing advertisements from some of our partners.

Your privacy is important to us, so, we would like to give you the 
opportunity to let us know if you no longer wish to receive promotional or 
advertising emails from us. To stop receiving either of these types of emails 
from us, please click here and follow the instructions on the page.

If you would like to review our privacy policy, please click here. 

If you would still like to continue receiving these emails, then great! 
You don't have to do a thing.

Thank you for your time.

Bernadette Sweeney 
Director - Customer Service
