		 Subject: 2001 Mileage Reimbursement Rate

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.
