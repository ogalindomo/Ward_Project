Attached is an proposed outline of the Brief we will file next week in the
Rate Design Case.  As you will see, the outline is more in the way of
putting out thoughts and highlighting where we need to reach some closure on
certain items as well as where I need some more input from you.  I would
like feed back on this by the end of the day Friday, as I plan to spend some
time on the brief this weekend. Perhaps we could spend some time talking
about it on either Thursday or Friday mornings' call.
