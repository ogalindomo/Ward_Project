Good question, Margo.  Yes, we should do as you suggest, check with counsel 
about transferring the existing CLEC license to ETI.  If not, then naturally, 
we will need to refile our application.  Marchris, could you check with 
counsel in FL and TX counsel?  Scott, could you check with OR?  I will check 
with Dan Clearfield for NY.  I will also submit an RCR for tier 1 and tier 2 
states for next week.  Please let me and Margo know what counsel advises.  
Thanks.

Mona,

How will we proceed in those states where we have obtained CLEC authority for 
EBS?  Should we first ask counsel to determine whether we can simply transfer 
the existing CLEC license to ETI?  I imagine we cannot do that, but I'm just 
wondering if it is a logical first step in those states to at least ask.

Thanks.
