The responses from many of you indicate that most of you are going to DC
to meet with Scott Miller's team, and that until that meeting concludes,
you are unable to determine whether a second meeting is required.

I told Scott that we should postpone a second WPTF meeting next week,
either in Houston or Chicago.  It just seemed there would be too few
people who could attend to drag Scott out of DC for a day.  I would
rather hold the opportunity for another time.  For those of you
attending the EPSA meetings in DC this week with FERC, please re-inforce
to Scott Miller that we may want to meet again as his study progresses.
It would be great to get an update of your perspectives on the meeting.
Maybe we should host a teleconference to hear your thoughts.
