The Assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up SBX2 78 in committee on
Friday.  If the bill passes, it may go straight to the Assembly floor that
night.  The Senate may go in either late Friday or early Monday to take up
the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed.

Amendments to SBX 78 may be available tomorrow.
