Hi everyone

Just FYI

There has been a change in location -- we will be staying at The Houstonian 
not the Hotel Lancaster in Houston for our govt. affairs offsite Feb. 7th - 
8th (Wed./Thurs) -- 

Thanks -- and please continue to let me know when you will be arriving (those 
of you who live out of state) so I can have the rooms adjusted accordingly 
(thanks to those of you who have sent me your information already)
