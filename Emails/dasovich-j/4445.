In response to the FERC Order on the California marketplace, Ridgeway Power
filed comments argueing for a waiver of QF regulations in order to incent
more power into the California marketplace.  IEP discussed this concept with
FERC Commissioners today and the Commission issued late today an Order
Granting Emergency Waiver of QF Regulations for the remainder of this year.
This order is attached as part of an additional order by FERC granting the
CAISO request for implementation of a $250 "soft cap" plus penalities for
failue to respond to CAISO dispatch orders during an emergency.

For QFs positioned to take advantage of the FERC Order, IEP suggests (1)
procure legal advice because in essense you have an existing contract with
the utility, (2) contact your utility/contract holder, and as appropriate
move to implement the FERC Order.  Your existing bilateral contract with the
utility provides for a SRAC based payment mechanism which appears to apply
under the FERC Order.   Note, however, that the waiver at this time only
applies through the end of this year.  You may have other options as well.
