AB 21X (Direct Access bill):
likely to pass out of the Asembly today; uncertain when it will go to 
Senate.  Here are highlights: ("effective date" is likely to be around July 
1, if it moves through)

before effective date, customer can go DA without limitation
existing DA can stay DA
after effective date, customer can go DA upon payment of exit fee based on 
DWR's unavoidable costs
after effective date, customer can go DA w/o exit fee if using self-gen or 
cogen and with 180 days advance notice
re-entry fee applies for return to bundled service from DA, unless 12 months 
advance notice is given 

AB 8X (San Diego rate freeze and QF provisions bill):
in Senate Energy today but under heavy pressure by QFs who are opposed to it

establishes 6.5 cent ceiling price for SDGE large customers
ceiling effective Feb 7 through end of PG&E/SCE rate freeze
commission may adjust the ceiling, if in the public interest

The San Diego language has been coupled with other language concerning QF 
payment (and bond issuance).  This should further delay any action.

We should have more information from Sandi McCubbin on the progress of both 
of these bills Friday.
