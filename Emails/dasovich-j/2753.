Hello Jeff,
Thank you for your inquiry into this property, it does show as available in
our calendar, but we will have to call the owner to double check if this is
truly the case.  If you would like us to do so please call us at
415-868-0717 and ask for Sarah, the owner will have some questions about you
before he gives the ok.
Thank you,
Melissa

Greetings:

I'm interested in renting the entire compound at "Sans Souci"--18 Avenida
Farralone in Stinson Beach from December 15th-17th and was wondering if
it's available.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
