Leslie, thank you for your comments.  

From my understanding, we have a need for the following:

1. Talking points directed to a CA audience (similar to the number of 
"one-pagers" we have already done for CA)
2. Talking points to circulate on the Hill
3. Points to include in a presentation to FERC on the 24th

It is not clear to me whether we should produce one document that fills all 
of these needs or if we need more than one document.  Perhaps, as Leslie 
mentioned in her message below, we should add some FERC-level solutions to 
this document and use it for several purposes.

**If someone has some suggestions about FERC language, please send them to me 
or call me and I will incorporate them and recirculate the document.**  

I am re-attaching the draft talking points again, for your reference.

Thanks, 

Jennifer

I guess my only thought is focused on the presentation to FERC on the 24th.  
The solutions you have identified are all at the state level.  Can we put in 
something to address what the FERC can do?  I am not sure what it is, but 
maybe it would include expeditious approval of projects to and WITHIN 
California that have been filed with FERC, as opposed to PG&E and SoCalGas 
projects, which would be within the province of the CPUC.  Something to think 
about.
