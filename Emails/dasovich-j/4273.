FYI.  Information from EBS on DSL Economics.  

At prices under $50/month (for DSL and ISP service), the article says that 
payback is only 12 months [Don't follow this necessarily because $600 first 
year Capex with only $600 of fees].

Clearly if you add on installation and potentially internal wiring fixes 
(moving a phone jack to the TV set) this only makes it harder to work. 

Also, interesting to note that Cable Modems are at least 10x faster than ADSL 
(why not go that route)?
