Rick-

It is Friday at 5:30 pm and here is where we are...

I have attached a document that is in NO WAY FINAL!!!!!

The document has NOT been signed off on by TURN. We are waiting to hear back
from Mike Florio on several important items. The document includes only ONE
edit submitted by Edison and agreed upon by WSPA - I did not include the
other edits Edison requested because I did not have sign off from any other
group. In all fairness, I did not hear complaints either -- but at this
stage in the game I am not willing to assume things are ok unless I hear
that definitively FROM EVERY GROUP!!! (hint hint) The document does NOT
include grammatical edits requested by CUE, I have stopped "tinkering" with
the document and am trying to include only "do or die" edits or typo fixes
from this point on.

So, that is the state of things. I am hopeful that we will have a final
document and cover letter to be signed by some if not all of us first thing
on Monday.

Thanks all,
Delaney
