Hi,

We'll let you know your Fall 2001 class schedules this Friday, May 4 and
you can e-mail me requests to add/drop from May 4 - May 11.

E236 Derivatives is a 2-unit course that meets the first 10 weeks of Fall 
2001,
on Wednesdays, 6-9 p.m. if you are interested in adding this course.

Thanks!
TJ
