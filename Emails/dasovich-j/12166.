Re: frequency of emergencies.

I have not seen any external projections of the freqency of events this 
summer.  Attached, is the historical record and some definitions. Thanks to 
Jennifer Thome for pointing me to this info.

Again, since CDWR only pays a "just and reasonable" rate for power in day 
ahead markets, it gets to decide on a day-ahead basis whether to send 
California into a stage 1/2/3 emergency.

FYI - In looking at the total time this summer of Stage 1-3 alerts in CA, in 
case you have not already, you may want to look at the following:
