Thanks Joseph.  Hopefully Jeff will break free.  I'll definitely be in to see 
Sandi at 10:00am, but will call the day before to confirm her (and Jeff's) 
availability.  My mobile number is 713 515 2759 in case you need to reach me 
earlier next week.

Regards,

Kurt Lindahl

Kurt,

Yes and no -- sorry, no response from Dasovich to date (he's been traveling 
all week); 
however, Sandi indicated she *should* be available that date (5/11) at 10 am.

I will keep you apprised,
Thanks,
Joseph

Joseph,

Have you been able to confirm a meeting for me on Friday AM, 11 May in your 
offices in San Francisco with Jeff Dasovich and Sandi McCubbin.  I would like 
to discuss with them our west coast LNG concepts and get their input 
regarding regulatory and legislative issues that we should consider.

Thanks,

Kurt Lindahl
