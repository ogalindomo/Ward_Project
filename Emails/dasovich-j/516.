Margaret Carson sent me the following three slide to update ---
 Low Customer Switch Rate Reflects Lack of Competition
 Core Customers Have Suffered from the Lack of Competition
 Market Share of Utilities/Affiliates in Retail Access Programs

These slide were done in 1998 and the  information came from "one" time 
reports or  comments.

Attached are 4 powerpoint slides that contain similar information.  Please 
review these slides and let me know if this will meet your needs as a 
replacement for the above titled slides.
