Given the importance of this document to the traders and given that the FERC 
may be considering a number of these dockets at its December 13th meeting and 
given that the agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, I would wait 
until the agenda is posted to update and forward to the traders.  The FERC's 
agenda is posted at:
