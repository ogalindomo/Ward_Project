		 Subject: Absolutely Final Version



Apparently the email between my firm and Williams is being delayed by  
hanging chads.? 90 minutes ago,?Alex Goldberg sent me an additional  sentence 
to be added to the end of the second paragraph of the filing and an  
additional clause to be added to the end of the?first sentence of the third  
paragraph.? However, it still has not been received.? So, Alex  dictated the 
change, it's been sent to our DC office, and here is the absolutely  final 
version?for your information.
