Subject: TW neg. rate order summary

(1) Transwestern Negotiated Rates proceeding, RP97-288 et al.:  The order=
=20
calls for an expedited hearing to explore four primary issues (listed=20
below).  The draft order passed at the meeting by a vote of 5 =01) 0, and=
=20
language on revisions to TW's tariff and posting policy were added to the=
=20
final order to assuage concerns expressed in the discussion of the case at=
=20
the meeting. =20

The case was called for public discussion by Commissioner Breathitt, who=20
wanted to highlight that the additional =01&limited scope=018 fast track he=
aring =20
is the =01&right way to go=018 to understand why negotiated rates that were=
 seventy=20
times the maximum recourse rate are just and reasonable.  Breathitt=01,s=20
additional question in this case is why shippers would agree to such rates=
=20
when lower rates were available.

In the final order, Breathitt=01,s concerns about the posting of the operat=
ional=20
capacity as such were reflected in language ordering TW to revise its tarif=
f=20
and web postings to provide clear identification of operational capacity an=
d=20
to post and contract such capacity on each day of its availability (i.e., o=
n=20
a day-to-day basis) unless it can demonstrate that operational capacity wil=
l=20
be available for some longer period of time.

At Wednesday=01,s meeting, Wood noted that =01&we bumped into something her=
e,=018=20
though he did not mention possibilities but instead agreed that a procedura=
l=20
schedule to =01&vet the issues in the light of day=018 was the best route. =
  The=20
four issues set for hearing are: =20
  ? whether the transportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an=20
accurate and fair    manner consistent with Transwestern=01,s tariff;=20
  ? whether the transportation rates=01(were the product of an exercise of=
=20
market power (i.e., did    TW withhold capacity that otherwise could have=
=20
been made available under recourse service    in order to make the capacity=
=20
available under negotiated rate charges at substantially higher    rates);=
=20
  ? why the shippers agreed to these rates when significantly lower recours=
e=20
rates should have    been available under our negotiated rate program; and=
=20
  ? why the awarded capacity appears to be available without interruption=
=20
while firm     transportation service under Transwestern=01,s recourse rate=
 was=20
not.
