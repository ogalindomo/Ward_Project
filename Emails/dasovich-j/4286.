Fellow MBA students,

I'm planning my annual dive trip next year for somewhere close, so it's
going to be in Cozumel.  It will be from June 9-17, will cost about $800
(hotel, diving, all meals - really cheap), plus airfare.  Let me know if any
of you are interested in coming and I'll give you more info.

Good luck with finals!!!!
