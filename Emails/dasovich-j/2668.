Confidential Settlement Material under CPUC Rule 51

Gas Accord II Rule 51 Parties:

Attached are the questions we noted at the October 11 and 12, 2000 Gas
Accord II Workshop, and our responses to these questions.  One set of Q&As
are on the Data Book (in Word).  Also attached is a replacement for Item 7
in the Data Book making slight corrections to the EG numbers.  The other set
of Q&As are responses to questions raised during the Cost of Service, Cost
Allocation and Rate Design presentations (in Excel).

We will provide hard copies of this information at tomorrow's Workshop.  If
you have questions, please let us know at any workshop or by e-mail.

Thank you for your participation in Gas Accord II and in the Workshops.
