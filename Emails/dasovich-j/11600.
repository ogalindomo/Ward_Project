Paul and Sue:
I am leaving it up to you to invite Former Govenor Marc Racicot.  Rick and I 
have discussed and agreed this upcoming meeting is an excellent opportunity 
for him to meet the rest of the team and get integrated into the larger 
"national campaign".

****Friday's meeting is not a time for us to "debate" the issues.  A 
forthcoming agenda will outline the specifics, but overall I am expecting 
full commitment from everyone to a "strategic, coordinated, and organized 
effort for the next 6 months".

See you in SF.
