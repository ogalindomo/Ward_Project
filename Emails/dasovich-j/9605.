Dude, what a loaded question.  Of course, we should always use opportunities 
like this to further Enron's position on landscape - regulation/artificial 
barriers, suck, competitive market solutions, rule!  Its clear to me that 
SoCal Gas sees this as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone... I'm 
the prudent LDC looking for solutions, and I don't have support at the CPUC 
to get acceptable rate treatment.

They don't address the regulatory issues here with respect to unbundling, et 
al.  I'm not sure what opportunity there will be here to push that agenda 
forward.  When you talk about hospitable investment climate, aren't you 
talking about both rate coverage as well as regulatory landscape?

Are you interested in going?

Do we want to position this as "let the market do it, cuz it can do it better 
than Socalgas; but the market ain't going to do anything if you don't create 
an hospitable investment climate?"
