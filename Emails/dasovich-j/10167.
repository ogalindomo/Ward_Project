Greetings:
I either haven't received, or received but misplaced, my mutual fund cost 
averaging report, which I need for to report my taxes for FY2000.  Is it 
possible for you to send me the cost averaging figures for Fidelity's "Fifty" 
Fund, which I sold in 2000 but need the cost average figure for?  Thanks very 
much.

Best,
Jeff Dasovich
