   The letter looks fine, but there is an incorrect reference on page 12 
about the risk management tools.  It states that SDG&E has been granted 
authority to enter into bilateral contracts, the CPUC has not yet issued that 
decision.  The SDG&E proposal is on calendar for 9/21, when it is likely it 
will be approved under the terms you reference.

 Subject: IMPORTANT -- Letter to Governor Davis

 Folks-
 At today's meeting, those Group members who attended agreed that we should
 indeed send the letter with changes reflecting the new legislation. Attached
 is the newest draft of such a letter. We need to send this letter out FRIDAY
 so in order to do that please look over the letter carefully and let me know
 if your organization wishes to be included as a signatory. I need every set
 of eyes out there to look this letter over for spelling, grammar and
 content -- my eyes have seen it too many times and are apt to miss things.
 So, here is the process ---

 Let me know of any minor changes ASAP. If there are content changes please
 email them to the ENTIRE group for sign off. Please understand that we want
 to send this FRIDAY so we do not have a lot of time to make changes. When I
 have a final draft I will ask people to fax signatures or send originals to
 me by Friday.Thank you all for your help with this letter. We could not have
 done it with out you.

 We will be scheduling our next general meeting for mid October. Also, we
 have finalized the dates for the Annual Retreat and will be sending out
 packets with all the details next week. DJ and I are working on the agenda
 so if you have a specific topic you would like covered please let us know.
 As always, please send me an email or give me a call if you have any
 concerns or questions about the letter or any other matter.

 Thanks,
 Delaney
