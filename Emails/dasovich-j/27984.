FYI, FERC has issued a notice of technical conference to discuss the issues 
surrounding El Paso's proposal addressing system-wide capacity allocation.  
The conference is scheduled for Wednesday, July 18 and will continue through 
Thursday, July 19 if necessary.  "Parties protesting aspects of El Paso's 
filings should be prepared to discuss alternatives."  (in other words -- 
don't come just to gripe and bitch!)
