FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to 
Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals 
process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay 
in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" 
provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is 
still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  

Happy 4th to all.

Best,
Jeff
