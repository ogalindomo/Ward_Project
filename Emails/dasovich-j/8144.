   CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT
   PER CPUC RULE 51

ALL INTERESTED PARTIES:

This is a reminder that PG&E will hold the first Gas Accord II Workshop of
the new year on Wednesday and Thursday, January 10 and 11.  The workshop
will be held at PG&E headquarters in San Francisco, 77 Beale Street, in
Conference Room 300.

Our objective for this workshop is to review and explain PG&E's
comprehensive settlement proposal, which was distributed by e-mail on
December 21, 2000, to those parties who have explicitly agreed to abide by
CPUC Rule 51.

If you did not receive a copy of the December 21 transmittal and would like
one, please complete the attached Rule 51 form and return it by e-mail to
Frank Lindh (frl3@pge.com) and Geoff Bellenger (gjb2@pge.com), or by FAX to
Geoff at 415-973-0881.

Because we will be discussing the substance of PG&E's settlement proposal at
next week's workshop, any party who wishes to attend will be required to
have completed the Rule 51 form.  (Please note, if you received our December
21 transmittal, then that means PG&E has your Rule 51 form on file, so there
is no need to fill it out again.)

Also attached below is a proposed Agenda for next week's workshop.  We will
start the sessions at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday and at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday.
We will provide coffee and juice in the morning, and lunch each day.

If you do plan to attend next week's workshop, we request that you please
confirm your attendance, so that we can get a headcount for the food and
drink orders.  Please e-mail a response to Darcy Morrison (D2Mr@pge.com), or
telephone Darcy at (415) 973-6644.

We look forward to seeing you next week and having a productive discussion.
