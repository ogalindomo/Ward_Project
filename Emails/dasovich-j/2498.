Subject: Revised draft of White Paper



Mary, Tim and Ron:

Dear all:

OK. I think we have all of Tim's comments and suggestions in. I wanted to
make sure this got out while folks were still there. Please see the sections
we discussed this morning. I have concentrated on the analysis and not the
typos so be on the lookout.

I will be in my office in the morning if anyone needs to reach me, or try my
cellphone (617) 513-5904.

All the best,


Seab
