		 Subject: Admission Round 2

Hello Comrades:

Round two of the admission process is onto the
acceptance stage and Diane has called upon us again to
rally round the phones and corral these new admits. 
We have about 85, so with 7 of us, that translates to
about 12 contacts apiece.

Please confirm your willingness and availibility so I
can send out the lists ASAP.  TJ tells me that they
want these calls made this week.

Thanks, again  (and you thought you were enjoying your
summer--except for the Enron manager, of course)  ;-]


JT
