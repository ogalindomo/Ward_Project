I found a Green Team meeting notice and there is a meeting  on Dec 1 at the 
same time as the Oversight Board meeting -- maybe the two orgs have been 
merged.  The agenda is:
1.  management report
2,  fulfillment of AB 970
3.  state consumer services agency report on energy savings in state buildings
