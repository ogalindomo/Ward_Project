I would like to see us try to re-insert words to the effect that if the 
Commission throws out the CSA after haranguing the parties to reach an 
agreement, it will seriously discourage future settlement efforts by parties. 
That is not a deal-breaker for me, just a suggestion. Otherwise the comments 
are fine.

Subject: FW: Proposed revisions to CSA Letter 

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.? I do not feel they diminsh 
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you 
would expect.? They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural 
events at the end of the letter.? If this gets them on the letter, I say 
let's sign.? I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the 
letter unless I hear differently from you by 3 pm today.? I really 
appreciate the quick turnaround.? Mike Day

Mike,  
Here are SoCal's proposed revisions to the CSA letter - I'll call in a 
minute.? The edits are pretty extensive, but all along the lines we
discussed (ie changing the tone to a more positive one).
