General Matters:

The legislature met today to consider SB18x.  They are expected to break
late this afternoon, and return on Monday morning to begin anew around 10:00
a.m.  Accordingly, bill language is not expected to move to the committee
this weekend.

QF Matters:  QF bill language is still expected to be included in the
general bill or, alternatively, linked directly to the general bill through
another specific piece of legislation.  This is expected to occur on Monday.
Mr. Keeley's office has collected to positions of the parties, including the
IEP "Blueprint".  His staff will take the lead, working with the principle
authors, to piece together a total package that will go to leg counsel.
This is expected to occur Monday.  IEP will continue to monitor, however,
over the weekend.


AS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE YESTERDAY, IEP IS
CANCELLING TODAY'S (FRIDAY) CONFERENCE CALL SCHEDULED FOR 5:00 P.M.   WE ARE
PRE-SCHEDULING A CONFERENCE CALL FOR MONDAY AT 5;00 P.M.  ON MONDAY, CAROL
HUDSON WILL DISTRIBUTE THE CALL-IN NUMBER.

IF ANYTTHING BREAKS LATER TODAY OR OVER THE WEEKEND, WE WILL CONTACT YOU VIA
EMAIL AND SET UP A NEW CONFERENCE CALL.
