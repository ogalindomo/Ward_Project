?
I am increasingly asked to pronounce on California  all over the world, and 
have in process a piece at present, stimulated by the  various statements 
from Borenstein, Teece et al, Ruff etc.? I do wish we  had had a chance to 
talk during my visit.? I wonder whether you have any  papers, by yourselves 
or others, that express Enron's perspective on all  this.? The reported 
proposals to get the state into ownership and trading  seem most unhelpful to 
competition.
