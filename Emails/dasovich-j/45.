 Thank you for the summary.  ORA's proposed language under the cost
recovery section:

Cost Recovery
 -  Revise Section B.3 (now B.4) to eliminate the last sentence and
add the following "While PG&E may seek recovery of these costs, other
parties to this settlement do not necessarily support PG&E's right to
recover any additional costs."
