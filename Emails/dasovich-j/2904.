Attached please find the weekly Government Affairs Report.  Please keep in 
mind that this is a "living document" and that any and all comments or 
suggestions are encouraged.  I have added a calendar page and a 
state-by-state resource page which I will be working on populating.  I have 
also included some document links on the main page in the event the reader 
would like more detail.  Please provide me with a list of people that you 
would like to receive this report.  Also, as a reminder to the government 
affairs folks, please forward any information/filings to me as soon as 
possible so that I can incorporate them into the document - please include as 
much detail as possible.  Thanks and feel free to contact me with any 
questions/comments likes/dislikes, etc.
