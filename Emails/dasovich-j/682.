Steve,

It was pleasure meeting you this morning. 

Following is the MSA that we discussed this morning. I think all we will be 
required to do is amend the agreement to read "telecommunications services 
and bandwidth units". 

Further, on Monday, I hope to send you a draft of an "outsourcing" agreement 
between Enron Corp., and an affiliated entity.

Best regards,

Donald
