Gas OII Parties:

Attached is the list of actions which were agreed to at the first OFO Forum
held on August 29, 2000, in San Francisco.  Comments or feedback from the
parties attending the Forum is appreciated.  The basic consensus was that
there is no need for changing anything based on the first several months of
experience under the OFO Settlement.  The best course is to obtain more
experience, monitor OFO behavior and then further consider the options.

Please call or e-mail us if you have questions or comments.  Thanks to those
parties who attended the Forum.  We felt it was a very productive day.

Sincerely,

Randy Litteneker   Ben Campbell
