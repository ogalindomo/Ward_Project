You're the one bright spot in the California crisis!  I hate to even tell 
you, but I talked to Skilling this morning (cover shoot for Biz 2.0) and he 
watched the pie-throwing tv coverage and commented about your great shot!  
It's a classic expression, and if everyone didn't love you dearly, we 
wouldn't be having as much fun w/ it.  Did you ever watch?  :-) kd
