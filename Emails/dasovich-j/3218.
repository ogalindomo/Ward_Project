I may be wrong, but trying to follow the press and Houston-originated 
e-mails, I am under the impression that FERC has issued an order finding that 
California prices were NOT unjust and unreasonable, and that generators did 
NOT abuse marketpower in recent price setting exercise, and that there may be 
a California PUC order relevant to the recent price flare up.  Any way, as 
Jeff will know, a UK academic is going to be presenting in Berkley and Tokyo 
later this month, arguing that hogan and Joskow are wrong about the value of 
retail competition, and he expressed an interest in being current on recent 
agency pronouncements.  To make this long story shorter, are there 
citations/references to such orders that I could provide to the good 
Professor (admittedly doing a bit of his work for him, but hopefully by being 
current his message will be more on)?  If yes, can I get the FERC cites (and 
web reference) from Joe or Sarah, and any California PUC order citation (and 
web reference) from Jeff?   many thanks  mcs
