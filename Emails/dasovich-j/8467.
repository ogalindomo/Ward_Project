Jeff - my reply to Teece

David:

I will be pleased to sign and endorse the manifesto.  However, I am
troubled by three points.

First - there is no mention of further deregulation of the market as
regards distributed generation.  I know this hurts the incumbent utilities
- and that may create problems for some members.  However, I think the only
way  to get large consumers to buy in.  Further, it is essential to make
deregulation really work.

Second - the natural gas issue is not mentioned.  Yet natural gas is part
of the problem.

Third - the manifesto is far too long.  I would suggest that it needs to be
cut to two pages - or preferably 800 words.  I know this is short - but
short pieces get attention.  For example, my Sept 13 op ed in the NY Times
got oil released from the SPR.  We have the content - now we need the red
pen.
