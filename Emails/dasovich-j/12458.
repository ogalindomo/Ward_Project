Subject: ISO Compliance Filing on Credit May Need Protest

On May 11, the CA ISO made a "compliance filing" for the April 6 order on 
credit worthiness in the real-time market.  Whereas the FERC order REQUIRED 
the ISO to get creditworthy parties -- the ISO portrayed it as an obligation 
of the buying party.  Therefore, the ISO's letter says that the ONLY party to 
come forward to provide credit support was DWR -- and because of DWR's 
"fiduciary obligation to conserve the finite resources that have been placed 
at its disposal", DWR REQUIRED access to the ISO's control room floor and 
non-public data.  This is outrageous and just shows that the ISO has, in 
effect, become a state-run, vertically-integrated utility. Question -- do we 
want to protest this? Or sit by and see what the generators do? If we want to 
comment, it would be due June 1.
