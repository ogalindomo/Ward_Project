Hi Will,

Thanks for e-mail!!

Is there anyway I can tell you how many tickets I need and leave a check in
your box on Monday or mail it to you today.  I had a mid-term last night and
forgot to bring my check book and won't be back on campus until Monday.

Let me know what would be easier for you!

thanks,
Jackie

Just a quick reminder, Friday is the last day to purchase your discount ski

checks in ASAP.  Thanks
