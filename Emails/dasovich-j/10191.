Since I forgot to send something out sooner for dinner this Thursday, and
after 5 semesters at Haas we finally get a Spring Break, lets get together
and catch up next Wednesday.

I was thinking dinner in the city (baby's and s/o's invited) and no excuses,
Courtney!  :)

I could have it in the Mission or Noe Valley to make it easier for our
friends in the peninsula - any suggestions?

We also have two birthdays to celebrate: Teddy and Paul.

Hope to see you next week!
