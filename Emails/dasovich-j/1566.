A few of you have asked for additional material on strips, since the text
book does not cover this.  There was already a FAQ on this (What is a
Strip?) but I have also added another FAQ.  This is a two page explanation
of what a strip bond is and how to price them.  Click on "Can you provide us
with additional material about strips?" on the FAQ page:
