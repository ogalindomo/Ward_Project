Attached are summaries of three recent advice letters.? AL 1268-E,  dealing 
with net energy metering, may be of interest.? Also, SDG&E has  either 
skipped, or not sent out yet, an advice letter numbered 1224-G.? I  have sent 
a request for a copy of it and will send on a summary when it is  received.
