Hello,
I understand that some students in E203 have not received the emails I have
been sending out. I am not sure whether this is because they are not on the
email list or whether there is something the matter with the emails. I hope
that this one does get to you.

Here is a copy of the HW problem solutions. They should also be on the web.
You can get to them either through Pf. Berk's website, or by going to mine
at http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/duggar and then clicking on the B203 link.
