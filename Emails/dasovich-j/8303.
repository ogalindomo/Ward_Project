We are proud to announce that Enron is one of the title sponsors of the "100 
Years of Energy" special to air locally on ABC Channel 13, January 13th and 
20th at 6:30 p.m.  Ken Lay, as a leader in the energy industry, will be one 
of the featured executives.  This special was produced in commemoration of 
the 100th anniversary of Spindletop.

With our sponsorship, we also received the opportunity to have four :30 
second vignettes about Enron produced by the Channel 13 staff. These spots 
will run throughout January and February.  The spots highlight Enron as a 
leader in innovation, energy and technology; Enron's involvement in the 
Houston community; and our corporate environment.  I have included the 
schedule for the next two weeks (see below). 

Our level of sponsorship also includes two weeks of radio promotion on KTRH 
and three insertions in the Houston Business Journal.  Copies of the special 
will also be distributed to local schools.

I would like to encourage each of you to tune in and watch the special on the 
13th or 20th. 

If you would like copies of the special or the vignettes please let me know.  
Reproductions are available. 

I can be reached at x 3-4535.

Thank you!  Laura Schwartz
