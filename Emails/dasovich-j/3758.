Greetings:

IEP will be holding a press conference on Tuesday November 28 at 10:30 a.m.
in the Governors Press room to discuss the importance of long-term fixed
(that term is easier to understand than bilateral) contracts.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the
solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have
continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current
retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant
to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We
will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that
long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act
immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness
review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term
fixed contracts.

IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the
Press Conference.

We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show
that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term
fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if
you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as
we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
