Subject: SCE Writ of Mandamus DENIED


The DC Circuit just issued a one page order denying SCE's motion for a Writ 
of Mandamus as well as its alternative request that the court direct FERC to 
act on rehearing of the Dec. 15, 2000 order by Jan. 17.  The court instead 
stated that it "anticipated that the Commission will rule on the rehearing 
petition in a timely manner."

I've asked my secretary to fax a copy of the order to you.  Let me know if 
you do not receive one soon.  Ron
