Sorry I can't make it; I have a conflict.  I suggest you meet without me and 
I can catch up later.

Subject: CPUC workshop- conference call

Sorry for the late notice, but is it possible to get together by telephone 
tomorrow at around 10:00 a.m. CDT to discuss the upcoming CPUC workshop and 
how TW and Enron should be engaged in that process?  Mark, Jeff, we'll 
initiate the call here from Houston.
