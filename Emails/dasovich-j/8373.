Jeff:

Per your request, please find the 2 Memo's we prepared on
interconnection agreements - the first deals with general rights and
responsibilities, including options for obtaining ICAs.  The second Memo
focuses entirely on the specifics of how ETI obtains ICAs, and the
advantages and disadvantages fo each option.

Once you have had a chance to review the Memo's, we can discuss the next
steps in more detail.  Please feel free to let us know any questions in
the meantime. Thanks.
