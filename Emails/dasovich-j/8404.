Jim--I had a wide ranging social/business conversation with Curt Hebert on 
Saturday night at one of the inaugural events.  I'll call you to give you the 
details, including all the good things I said about you!!!  He was being 
quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that 
his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement 
with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.  I promised him that 
either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give 
him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.  My 
initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, 
but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not 
having FERC there.  As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between 
Cynthia Sandherr and me, the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also 
following this meeting, although I don't know if they are participating.

I'll call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversation

Linda--I also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that I'll need to 
talk to you about!
