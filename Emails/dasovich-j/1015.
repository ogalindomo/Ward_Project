Dear Mr Dasovich,
I am just back in my office and I would thank you for any information and 
offer.
In the next 4 weeks the Minister of Industry must complete the restructuring 
of the
Italian electricity system and for the new year the Independent System 
operator -
the Pool - and the Single Buyer must start (tentative date).
We really need any professional help we will be able to find and I believe I 
will
contact you very soon. In the main time I will be in touch with Professor
Borenstein (to which I am sending the same e-mail) and his Institute that I 
would
like very much to visit in the next months.
All the best,
Fabio Gobbo
