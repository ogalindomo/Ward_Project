Jeff/Janel/Paul -- I was just thinking about influential people to contact 
our top 5 legislators plus Davis...  Besides the Silicon Valley CEOs, Mike 
Peevey is pretty tight with and trusted by Davis.  When we met w/ Peevey, he 
told us he was in agreement on direct access -- how about a call to him 
asking him to weigh in w/ Davis.  Also, Peevey's wife is a freshman 
assemblywoman (Carol Liu, I think).  So I think Peevey is a key influential.  
What do you think? kd
