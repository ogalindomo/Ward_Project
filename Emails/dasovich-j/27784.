Subject: FERc Questions to SoCal Gas


FERC issued a letter order requesting further information to help understand
Lad Lorenz's presentation at the May 24 California Gas Infrastructure
Conference.  A copy of the FERC questions, as well as Lad's presentation is
attached.


 <<PL01-4.00B.doc>>  <<LadLorenz.ppt>>
Specifically FERC seeks to understand:
1. Since SoCal is a matrix system, why is Topock a more desirable
receipt point than Blythe (Ehrenberg) or any other receipt point on the
SoCal system?

2. How SoCal determines the amount of capacity that is available at
each interstate receipt point.

3. How SoCal determines who gets capacity on the SoCal system or if
they rely on El Paso's priority system, and how nominations and
confirmations work.

4. The rationale the current procedures in which non-core customers
cannot contract for firm capacity on SoCal's backbone system.

5. The process of lining up markets if a "marketer" is nominating
capacity on the SoCal system.

6. Curtailments, or lack thereof on the SoCal system.

7. The authority SoCalGas has to construct its proposed 4 smaller
expansion projects at a total cost of $55 million which will add 475 MMcfd
(13.5%) of firm backbone capacity.

8. Whether SoCal has or has in effect proposed an exit fee for
customers that interconnect to new interstate pipeline capacity?

9. Whether SoCal received or requested an "award", increased revenue, a
sharing of savings, or similar monetary benefit from Hub services or the
operation of the Gold Coast Incentive Mechanism?
