Calif State Senate Passes Windfall Profits Tax Bill
Monday, May 07, 2001 08:48 PM ET


LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California state Senate passed a measure Monday 
that would place a windfall-profits tax on sales of electricity into the 
state's wholesale electricity market.

The bill, SB1X, sponsored by state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Ontario, passed the 
Senate by a vote of 25-12. The legislation will now be sent to the Assembly.

The legislation would require state regulators to set a base price for 
wholesale electricity sold in California and generators would be taxed at 
100% above the base price for power sales that exceed that amount, according 
to the legislation.
