Reply comments are due tomorrow, 11/17, on TURN's motion to roll the TRA
balances into the TCBA.  We are responding only to SCE/PG&E who have said
let's end the rate freeze early and collect the TRA balances from the
customers.

I have toned down language on expectation of rate reductions.  I also think
we should tone down the language of what PG&E had been saying 6 months ago
and what they are saying now.  We can be snared in that trap.

Any comments/concerns, please let me, Roger and Jeanne know by noon p.s.t
11/17.  Thanks.
