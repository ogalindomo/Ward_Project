This information updates the WSCC data and supplies support for the data in my
and Tim's presentations.  In particular, it shows that there is more scarcity
than we originally stated because the WSCC data relied on assumed that all of
the hydro capacity could be used when, in fact, the hydro system is overbuilt
such that if all the capacity available were used at Grand Coullee, downstream
areas would be flooded.
