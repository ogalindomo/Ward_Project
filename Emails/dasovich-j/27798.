I have added a reference to recent FERC decision in a Kern River case which 
rejected a contract provision between Kern and Union Pacific which would have 
given UP priority rights to reduce its CD.  This is on page 9.

		 Subject: FOR FINAL REVIEW -- ENA Comments in Support of Kern River

Attached for your review and comments are ENA's comments in support of Kern 
River's petition for a declaratory order relating to SoCal Gas' assertion 
that it has the first right to expansion capacity now being constructed in 
the California Emergency Action Project  to add 135,000 Mcf/d of capacity to 
California that would come on-line during July.

The comments must be filed at FERC by Friday, June 15.  If you have issues or 
comments, please contact Leslie Lawner or me as soon as you can.  Leslie is 
at 505-623-6778 and my extension in Houston is 35840.  If possible, e-mail us 
since we will both be traveling or at an off-site meeting beginning mid-day 
Wednesday.
