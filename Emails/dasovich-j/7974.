To ensure that we don't miss any of the reporting dates and requirements that 
FERC has established, we asked Bracewell & Patterson to prepare a memorandum 
laying out the various reporting times and requirements.  Andrea Settanni at 
Bracewell has reviewed FERC's December 15 order and prepared the attached 
memo.

Alan, it is my understanding that you will be responsible for ensuring that 
we meet all of these reporting requirements.  I will call you to make sure 
that we're on track for the first report which is due on January 2.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sarah
