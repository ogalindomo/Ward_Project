In an effort to control costs for travel expenses, as Jeff Skilling suggested 
in his floor meeting last week,  Rick would like for everyone to purchase 
tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred 
travel agent for Enron.  The savings that Enron receives from using TAP is 
insurmountable.  See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with 
some of the airlines.  Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least 
3-7 days in advance.  Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential 
switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for 
hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the 
corporate rate.  TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address:

Also, if at any time you are interested in having your spouse travel with you 
on a business trip, at the company's expense,  it is necessary for you to 
have spousal approval.  This approval is needed in advance of the trip, by 
your immediate supervisor and Rick Shapiro.  Below you will find an attached 
spousal approval form.
