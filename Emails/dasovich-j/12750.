Attached for your review, comment and suggested changes is a draft of the 
remarks that Mark Baldwin will make on behalf of TW at the upcoming CPCU 
hearing.  Mark, I think you did an excellent job at framing the issues.  I 
hope my editing didn't interfere with the solid content embodied in your 
draft.

Since Mark will be presenting on Tuesday, if possible, please have your 
comments/suggestions/changes back to me by noon, Monday.  

Thank you.

Jeff
