Jeff:? The FCC 214 number we discussed references a license as an Interstate 
Carrier, which you should apparently not need at this junture.? However, can 
you send the document itself regarding this issue to make sure? 
???????? Texas requires an inital COA or SPCOA (certificate of operating 
authority) depending on your business plan, and the CLEC application asks for 
NECA 
( National Exchange Carriers Association) i.d. number if you have one; it 
also asks for a FCC CIC (Carrier Identification Code) "if available" - 
perhaps this is what you were referring to; and that would probably not be an 
impediment to filing. 
??? Anita can check with Texas if you need more information - we do it all 
the time and so it's no problem. Thanks.
