Re: PG&E's Open Season --

 <<PGE Open Season Application Comments.rtf>>

Attached are Pacific Gas and Electric Company's responses to Administrative
Law Judge Brown's questions posed in the "Administrative Law Judge's Ruling
Shortening Time for Protests or Responses and Replies to the Application
Filed by Pacific Gas and Electric Company," issued June 14, in A.01-06-020
("PG&E gas transportation open season").

These PG&E responses ("PG&E Comments") are provided to the e-mail list sent
out yesterday (June 19) to recipients, per Judge Brown's request to PG&E.
(Please note that a limited number of recipients subsequently notified PG&E
that they did not wish to remain on the e-mail list.  Accordingly, PG&E has
modified the list and the instant e-mail list of recipients reflects those
modifications/deletions.)

PG&E will also provide the PG&E Comments by mail to the service list in
I.99-07-003.

If technical questions arise from this e-mail, please call my secretary, Amy
Yu, at 415-973-2769.

Thank you,

Dave Anderson, PG&E Law Department 415-973-6659
