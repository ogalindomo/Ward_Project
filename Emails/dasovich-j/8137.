ABSTRACT OF COURSE'S CONTENT AND OBJECTIVES: This is a  1-unit course dealing 
with a variety of current issues regarding doing business  in Asia and/or 
with Asian business in the US. The format of the class will  consist 
primarily of a series of outside speakers with expertise in the Asia  Pacific 
region, such as Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Korea, etc. Apart from  the 
macroeconomic environments and recent changes taking place in Asia, we aim  
to explore areas such as business culture, relationships (with clients, 
bosses  and colleagues), establishing trust, gender, ethnicity in the 
particular  context, and to provide general introduction to living and doing 
business in  Asia and/or with Asian companies in the US.?
