Yes, I'd like to talk to Steve Kean; I called his office this a.m. My 
Skilling interview isn't until the 28th, so if I could talk to Kean before 
then, that would be great. 

Cheers,
DK

Greetings: 
Saw your QF story.? You were right.? One never know what the "story du 
jour" will be. 

You still interested in talking to Steve Kean?? If you are, when do you 
talk to Skilling, and would you want to schedule something around that, or 
sooner? 

Best, 
Jeff
