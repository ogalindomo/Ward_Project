Attached is a copy of the draft issues outline circulated on June 11,
showing the suggested changes provided by SCE, TURN and CUE. I have not
indicated the source of the particular comments, consistent with our
ground rules.  Moreove, any failure to pick up a comment was
unintentional; it was a manual process and some comments were difficult
to merge.

See you tomorrow morning at 10.
