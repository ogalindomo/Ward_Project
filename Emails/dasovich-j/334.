Your welcome.  Also take a look at AB 1007 (Wayne) relating to internet 
privacy
(I've linked it below).  If you're concerned with privacy issues, another hot 
topic
is  SB 129 (Peace).  That bill intends to set up a privacy ombudsperson 
within the
Secretary of State's office and establish administrative penalties for privacy
violations.  It's currently in a conference committee.

With respect to SB 1217, the bill was aimed directly at Excite@Home and their 
deal
with TCI.   Certainly Excite and TCI opposed the bill.  I believe other cable
companies, including TimeWarner Cable also opposed the bill.  Supporters 
included
GTE and AOL.  It is my understanding that AOL will probably oppose the bill 
now
because of the merger.

I'll let you know if anything else develops.
