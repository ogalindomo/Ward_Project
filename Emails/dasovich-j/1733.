A few of you are having trouble when you click on the solutions to the
quizzes --- it crashes explorer.  The problem is intermittant with no
solution as of yet. (One more reason to break up microsoft!) The work around
is to right click on the link, then select
hyperlink-->open in new window.  This seems to solve this problem.
