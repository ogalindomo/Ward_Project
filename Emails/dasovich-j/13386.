Energy Committee Members:

At tomorrow's energy committee meeting, John Wilson from the CEC along with
two of his colleagues (John Flory, eNMARKET and Mike O'Sheasy, Christensen
Associates) will be present to discuss the CEC's proposed language on the
Real Time Pricing Tarriff.  Because of the short time frame available to
discuss the many items on our agenda, it is pertinent that we review this
language prior to the meeting so that we can be prepared with questions and
comments.  Please open the following attachment and review prior to
tomorrow's energy committee meeting.  If you have any problems with
transmission, please contact me.  Thanks!  Laura
