Five of us met this past Tuesday for the first time, and it worked out
really well.  We are going to do it again the same time and place:

Time: Tuesday (11/9) 6-8pm

Place: BofA building (corner of Kearny and CA) 30th floor (Aaron's office)
415-263-3320 if you get lost.



Last time we reviewed the Econ class notes and discussed the homework.  I
was thinking this week we could do that for one hour, and then discuss the
Accounting Case.

Please e-mail ME if you are planning on attending so we can get you through
the wall of security at Aaron's office and get you fed.  (We order in pizza
and will rotate who pays)
