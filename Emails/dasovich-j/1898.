I know I want: 

1/2 # of the best Italian fontina (for an hors d'oeuvre) 

For the cheese course I want 5 really neat cheeses: 

1 excellent stilton 
1 excellent white cheddar 
3 excellent French exotics - creamy types.? I think there is a very famous 
cheese called Roubouchon or something like that - Jeff??? and then whatever 
else would come recommended.? Thanks so much!!!
