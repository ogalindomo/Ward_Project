Julee Malinowski-Ball is out of town till Monday  April 16, 2001.  However,
the IEP company lobbyist conference call is scheduled for April 12, 2001 at
2:00 PM.  Julee thinks someone should lead the call and that it extremely
important and valuable for everyone to touch base before we get bogged down
again with hearings next week.
On the agenda should definitely be a discussion of AB 60x lobbying strategy
and update, SB 28x update and the proposed changes to SB 6x (heard from
Brian Kelly, he submitted language on the eminent domain provisions of the
bill).

Call In Date    ~     April 12, 2001

Call In Time    ~      2:00 PM

Call In Number ~     (800) 403-2013

Code               ~     207814

If you have any questions, please call me or email me.

Thank you,
