I know you must be buried with everything happening in CA - If not you, who 
can we work with re: CA gas issues.

In addition to the request outlined below, we need an update of the status of 
Socal and PG&E restructuring rules (GIR/Gas Accord).

Please advise ASAP!!!

Subject: SoCal Storage Rules

Stephanie,

Mark indicated that you might be able to answer or redirect some questions 
that we have regarding the CPUC's rules for SoCalGas storage.  I have 
attached some notes, along with related questions, from my review of various 
CPUC decisions and filings.  I appreciate any help you are able to give.



Thanks,
Tyrell
