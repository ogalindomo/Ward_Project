Rich spoke with Frank regarding focus group video and polling results.
Frank said that he would be happy to release poll results if he gets
approval from someone at Enron.  Can you facilitate this?

Also, Frank said that he does not have a copy of the focus group video.  Can
you obtain a copy for Rich?

Thanks.

Sandra
