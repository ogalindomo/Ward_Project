The California Independent System Operator has declared a Stage 1 Emergency
for the hours of 0815 to 2359 due to forecasted high loads throughout the

Consumers are requested to voluntarily curtail nonessential electric load to
avoid more severe conditions including involuntary curtailments.

The ISO indicated a  Stage 3 emergency and firm load shedding is  likely
today.

If outages occur they will include the remainder of Block 14 and portions or
