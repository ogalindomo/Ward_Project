Jeff & Miyung -

Steve Kean would like to build a database of offers made to California that 
were rejected last year.  This would become public information to give to the 
Bush Administration, Capitol Hill, etc.

1. Peaking Offers / Plants (incld Calpine) - Jeff can you work with Parquet 
to build this.

2. Terms sales to SDG&E last year - Miyung can you run a press clipping 
report to show what was not taken.  Also, Jeff can you please get the full 
details (MW, Price, Term) for our offer to SDG&E last year.

Thanks.  Please call with questions.

Jim
