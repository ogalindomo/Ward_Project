Yes,

It had by shipper, by contract level info.  -- the type of info available on 
our transactional reports.  There is a protective order in place in the 
proceeding, so I don't believe the information is generally available.  We 
did not ask for confidential treatment -- but we did excise rate information 
for periods prior to Sept. 2000 (the date that this info started appearing on 
our transactional reports).

Shelley, how detailed was the information provided?  Was it broken down by 
shipper?  Also, did you request confidential treatment?

FYI 

Judge Wagner issued a subpoena to Transwestern and several other pipelines in 
the referenced proceeding at SoCal Edison's request.  The request sought 
information on scheduled, actual and contracts quantities to the California 
border for the time period 1997 to present.  While we are not a party in the 
case, we decided to cooperate in the proceeding and not file a motion to 
quash.  We responded yesterday.
