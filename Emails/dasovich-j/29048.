Folks-
We will be having a meeting of the CA Energy Solutions Group on

Wednesday August 15, 2001
9:30 am to 3:00 pm
California Farm Bureau
2300 River Plaza Drive

DJ and I will be working on an agenda in the coming days. Please let us know
if there is something specific you would like to cover or if the 15th
appears to be a bad date.

Thanks much,
Delaney

P.S. Also be thinking of where you like to have the Annual Retreat -- should
we stick with Yountville or try somewhere new?
