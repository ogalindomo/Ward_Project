The blackoutbusters will hold the next 'pilot drill' on Friday, April
27, from 1-5pm.

We will have a coordination meeting on Tuesday, from 3:00-5:00 PM at
EPRI, 3412 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto. Please contact Paul Radcliff (650)
855-2720 if you need directions.

Once again, do not confuse it with the Business Continuity meeting that
will take place at its usual time (1:30Pm on Mondays)

The BlackoutBusters meeting will be to discuss nuts and bolts of
curtailing demand and share our experience.
