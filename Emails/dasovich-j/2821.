Hey there team,

Now that the mid term is over, I actually read Chapter 20 - confusing
stuff.  Just to clarify, the SF group will take the first three questions
and the east bay group will take the last two?

Also, we need to make a correction to the original assignments, some of
these have dates and some refer to the case chapters, please see
clarification below:

I will do my best to have something coherent for the SF group by Thursday
or Friday for the Ch 20 case.
