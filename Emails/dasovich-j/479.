Attached below is the final version of the main settlement document.  I
believe we have resolved all issues we had discussed.  There are a few
additional minor changes in the text.

Also attached is a version that compares the current version to the version
sent out around 11 a.m. this morning.

It probably is not feasible to make any further changes today that would
require review by all parties.  -- Glen
