Dear Colleagues,

Here is the FINAL version of the manifesto.  This version includes some
additions and deletions to bring on Paul Joskow and Janet Yellen, and
hopefully Severin Borenstein as well.  Also attached is a list of
endorsements Pablo and I have secured.  If you are not on the list and wish
to be added, please let us know.

Critically, let us know if you wish to be removed.  We are picking up new
endorse by the hour and will release by 9:00 am (PST) tomorrow.


David Teece and Pablo Spiller
