Attached is a link to Enron's California Solutions website.  It is a secure 
place on the Web that we can use to share resources and keep track of our 
efforts to manage the energy crisis in California, New York, Washington, DC 
and the West.  At this site, you will find:   

A list of the "Members" who retain either reader or author access to the site
A Task Page that identifies deliverables and who is responsible for 
completing specific projects
A Calendar with the details of conference calls, speaking engagements, 
hearings, and other public meetings that are pertinent to the energy crisis
News and articles
A compilation of Enron Position Papers regarding the energy crisis
A Library of documents addressing the energy crisis that have been published 
by external sources
Anouncements 
Updates 

The site has been recently updated and I think you'll find it is a useful 
place to archive information and documents that are related to our National 
Energy Campaign.  Please bookmark the site, and feel free to add information 
to the site that you wish to share with your colleagues.  If you would like 
to add or remove someone from the site or, if you have questions about the 
site, please contact Elizabeth Linnell or Janel Guerrero.
