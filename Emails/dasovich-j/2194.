Hey Everyone,

I reserved the West Point Inn for a December 9th get together.  It
should be a good time for sitting by the fire, drinking egg nog and
white russians, and hanging out with friends.  I hope you all can make
it.  Please let me know.  Also, let me know if you want to invite any
friends.
