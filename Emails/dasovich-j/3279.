Folks-
Just a reminder that if you will be including overheads, slides, handouts,
or any other info as part of your speech, discussion, or panel please send
said info to me via email or fax ASAP so that I can make adequate copies for
the Group. If you are so inclined as to make your own copies I would
recommend making 90 copies to cover all attendees.

Also, we will be providing an overhead projector and an LCD projector (for
power point presentations) for your use. If you require some other type of
A/V equipment please let me know ASAP.

Thanks to you all for agreeing to be a part of our Retreat. I expect it to
be quite an event. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks again,
Delaney
