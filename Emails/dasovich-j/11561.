		 Subject: AB 60x to be heard Tues.

Heard from Lawrence this morning who said AB 60x (Hertzberg) is likely to be
heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
companies may want to give him the specifics.

Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?

IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
Poochigian will be voting on the bill.
