Jeff-
Haven't talked to you in a while...thanks very much
for the vm you left a couple of weeks ago-very nice to
hear!  How are you?

Things are much better for me.  Over the newbie hump
at Sun.  Goood things happening in general.  Usual
fustrations. School is fine-'cept I have to take
dreaded sunner school.
Miss seeing you-how long will you be in Mexico?
C
