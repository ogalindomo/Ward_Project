Subject: Bullet points

Here's my stab at organizing the tremendous amount of material everyone has 
gathered these past few days.

The biggest points are in the biggest bold type.
The subsidiary points are in smaller bold type.
The substantial is in regular type.

Please send me your feedback.

Jeannie
