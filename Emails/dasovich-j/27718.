Current word is that the draft decision will be held over at least to the 
June 21 meeting.  Enron, along with the members of the Alliance for Retail 
Energy Markets, are launching an all-out campaign to get the decision 
changed.  Commissioner Bilas has indicated that he may draft an alternate 
that deletes the language.  Of course, we are still flying blind.  The draft 
has not been released to the public.

		 Subject: CA New Product Entry - Suspension of DA

I wanted to make sure that everyone involved with the CA New Product was 
aware that the CPUC may consider at its next public meeting (6/14) the 
implementation of the Direct Access suspension established in AB1x1.

We are hearing that the CPUC may not have 3 votes in favor of such 
suspension, but the topic is on the agenda.  It is very difficult to get any 
clarity on this issue given the politics and ex parte restricitions.

Even if the CPUC does not take action on this language at the next meeting, 
until that provision of the law is modified by the General Assembly, the CPUC 
could take action at a later time.

Please call me if anyone has any questions.
