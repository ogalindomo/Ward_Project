Jennifer:
To my knowledge, there's been no decision made to date on this issue of exit 
fees, either at the PUC or the legislature.  But it's my understanding that 
the rate increases just imposed by the PUC will NOT apply to DA customers.  
What happens to customers who switch today, I'm not sure.  Jeanne, any 
thoughts?
