Greetings:

IEP will be hosting a dinner for California Governor Gray Davis on Thursday,
December 7, 2000 at the historic Julia Morgan House in Sacramento. We will
be targeting to raise at least $100,000 so company contributions will range
from $10,000-$20,000 per person ($10k minimum per person) depending on the
number of respondents.  We have already received firm commitments from 3
companies.

If you are interested in attending please e-mail me as soon as possible.  A
formal invitation will follow to those who respond.

We need responses or direction by no later than COB on Monday, October 30,
2000.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thank you,
Katie Kaplan
Manager of Policy
