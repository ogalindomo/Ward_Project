Bob Anderson of APSES developed these data.  They show that the utilities 
took unbelievably outrageous open positions in the market this summer. There 
are two possibilities: 1 they are incompetent (WRONG) or 2 they were OK from 
a corporate perspective (because of other long positions) and expected to 
receive regulatory relief.  Bob will write it up and add as testimony in an 
appendix -- Gary Ackerman likely witness.
