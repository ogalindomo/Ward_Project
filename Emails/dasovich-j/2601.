Attached is a useful presentation on Securitazation.  We may want to propose 
this approach when the utility's CTC recovery period is shorter than we would 
prefer.  A utility may propose a shorter period due to cash flow and bond 
rating reasons; whereas, we might had taken a view of a longer recovery 
period in our curves.  Securitization might be the perfect win-win solution.  
If you would like a presentation on Securitization, please contact Jaime 
Araoz.
