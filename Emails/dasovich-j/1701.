I have plagarized Steve Kean's presentation on California and liberally 
sprinkled in some of the EPSA report to make a presentation tomorrow before 
the NMPRC and probably some legislators as well.  If you have a chance to 
review it for substance (or anything else) and can get back to me today, I 
would appreciate it.  If you don't have time, don't sweat it.  They never 
listen to me anyway!  Thanks
