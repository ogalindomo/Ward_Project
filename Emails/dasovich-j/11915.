Gas OII/OFO Settlement Parties:

Attached please find PG&E's OFO Report for the First Quarter of 2001.  This
is provided to you in accordance with the Operational Flow Order ("OFO")
Settlement Agreement, filed in the CPUC's Gas Strategy OII 99-07-003, and
approved by the CPUC by Decision 00-02-050.

The attachments consist of the Report (in Word) and two Appendices (in
Excel).  The Report will also be posted on the Pipe Ranger web site at
<http://www.pge.com/pipeline/library/index.html#settlements>

This is the fourth quarterly report since the implementation of the OFO
Settlement.  With a year of operating experience completed, we believe the
Settlement is a success in terms of 1) reducing the impact of OFOs on the
market, 2) improving market access to operational information, 3) improving
the ability of the market to foresee OFO events, and 4) significantly
reducing the number of system-wide OFOs.

An OFO Forum meeting was held on August 29, 2000.  There have not been any
significant developments that have arisen from the data or discussion in the
past several Quarterly Reports.  We see no current need for an OFO Forum
meeting in the near term.  Please let us know if you have issues you feel
would be best addressed by holding a meeting of the OFO Forum.

If you have any questions on this report, please contact Rich Hall at (415)
972-5115 or email address               rch8@pge.com <mailto:rch8@pge.com>.
