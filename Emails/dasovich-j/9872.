It was my pleasure to meet you last week in our Regulatory Meeting

As we spoke, I am sending you a preliminary version of the Gazeta Mercantil 
Seminar to be held on May 17, in S?o Paulo. They have initially invited Dan 
Fessler (not from Enron, as they say). I have already raised your name 
instead.

I'll keep you posted
