Jeff: 

Per our discussions, when Judge Pulsifer completes his new order granting 
NDIEC authority to Enron (in the very near future) we are going to file 
updated final tariffs. 

As part of that process, the Commission needs to see per the Decision 8/3 
sample "Forms" from Enron for things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill 
and New Service Orders.? If you can get your hands on such types of standard 
EBS/ETI forms, we will attach them to the CPUC filings. 

Also, you are still on to discuss interconnection agreements with Steve and 
us tomorrow at 2:00.? Let me know if we need to rearrange at all and we'll 
accomodate.
