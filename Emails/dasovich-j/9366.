WORKSHOP!

Register today at http://www.ccmi.com/tariffworkshop/ for CCMI's Telecom 
Tariff Workshop on March 21, 2001 at the Oxford Hotel, Denver, CO.

If you can't make this workshop in Denver, check out the remaining 4 dates & 
locations in 2001.  We'll cover everything you need to know to start using 
telecommunications tariffs.  Plus, we'll unveil timesaving tips for finding 
information you need using CCMI's TelView Tariff Library.

Part I of the workshop focuses on general Tariff Training.  Part II covers 
using the TelView Tariff Library.

When you attend, you will:

*   Discover the differences between General Exchange Tariffs, Access 
Tariffs, "Negotiated Tariffs", and how they can help you.
*   Find out how tariffs are organized, so you can find exactly what you're 
looking for.
*   Learn where to find tariff sections like Switched and Special Access, 
Local Calling Areas and Plans, ISDN, and more.
*   Get searching tips that'll save you hours of time when using TelView's 
search functions.
*   Find out how to use TelView's convenient bookmarks to zero in on key 
tariff sections.
*   And much more!

SEATING IS LIMITED TO 50 and at $139 - breakfast buffet, morning
