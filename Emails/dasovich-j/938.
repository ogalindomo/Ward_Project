The Alpert/Davis Bill (AB 265) and AB 1154 were voted out of the assembly 
last night.  Three bills are now joined together.  The Alpert/Davis Bill (AB 
265), Ducheny Siting Bill (AB 970) and AB 1154, which provides $150 million 
of money from the general fund to offset undercollections resulting from the 
Alpert/Davis bill imposition of a rate cap.  

AB 970 is being heard in the assembly as we speak.  It is expected to be 
voted out.  Then all three bills will be sent to the Governor to be signed. 

There were no revisions to the Alpert/Davis bill.

Green Mountain is working on a letter, that Alpert would sign, saying that 
underrecoveries resulting from the rate cap will be recovered from customers 
that benefitted from the rate cap and that DA customers will not be 
disadvantaged.
