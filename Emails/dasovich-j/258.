Dear class,

Here is the exam schedule.  Regardless of your regular class day, you can
take the exam either Wednesday 12/15 (start holidays early) or Thursday
12/16 (get that extra 24 hours of studying).  The exam is scheduled from
6:05 to 9:30, but should take far less time than that.

The locations are:
 Wed. C125 for computer users and C135 for handwritten.
 Thurs. C210 for computer users and C220 for handwritten.

Computer users should email me a copy of the exam and (just to be sure)
hand me a diskette as well.

See you soon,
- David
