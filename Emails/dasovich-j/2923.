		 Subject: CAISO Notice: FERC Order & Load Differentiated Price Caps

Given today's Order from FERC setting ISO price caps at $250 MWh for the
next 60 days and specifically rendering the October 26th ISO board vote on a
load differentiated cap null and void, we have ceased efforts to implement
the October 26th motion.

Prior to today's Order, the ISO had been working internally and with vendors
on implementation details. Also, a conference call was held with Market
Participants on October 30th to assess their implementation needs. Based on
this initial work, it appeared that implementation could occur in early
January 2001 but this work is being stopped as a result of today's Order.
