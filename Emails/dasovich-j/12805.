Jeff:

As you recall, during the call earlier today (8:30 am your time) Jim asked me 
to work with you on doing a comparision of how various proposals would cover 
DWR costs compared to the solution Enron advocates.   

It wasn't clear to me if you already did this analysis as part of the 
core/non-core research you are doing.  Please let me know if additional 
research needs to be done, and, if so, let me know when a good time would be 
for me to call you to discuss in more detail.

Thanks, 

Jennifer
