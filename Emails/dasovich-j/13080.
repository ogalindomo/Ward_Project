I was advised by Lad Lorenz of Socal that their original application sets 
forth the plan by which they will sell the residual gas in the Montebello 
storage field.

Can you please advise me of the final tems of the PUC decision (should have 
been announced yesterday) and get a copy of the application?

Based upon yesterday's conference in D.C., I  think the restructuring of 
Socal's backbone transportation is about to become a hot topic again! Please 
keep us apprised.

Regards,

Stephanie
