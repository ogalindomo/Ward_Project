Subject: CCF Large Customer Program --- Next Steps




Everyone, 

Attached is a new schedule with next steps for the Large Customer component 
of the CCF Program.?? Although we are not targeting implementation until 
January, you'll see that we still have several key dates and items to 
finalize. 

Please review this schedule as we have a meeting scheduled in San Diego for 
November 14th from 10am - 3:30pm as well as several conference calls in the 
next two months.?? The 11/14 meeting will be at SDG&E's Century Park 
facility. 

If you have any questions or wish to discuss further please give me a call. 

Thanks!?
