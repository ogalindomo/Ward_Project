OK.  Please inform Prentice and Jeff of this rule.  Anyone not in compliance
will be referred to only as "the riff-raff" over dinner.

Fondly,
Sarah E. Rogers

Definitely dress up.  What I am is what I wear.

Let me start off by thanking Scott for going with me to the New Yorker thing
- that and the Oriental "massage" parlor afterwards were great!

Secondly, Alison and I were thinking that it might be fun to get somewhat
dressed up for the party on Friday, since it is THE social event of the
season.  What do you guys think?  I'm not talking black-tie, but I am
looking for an excuse to wear a skirt or dress.  But I leave it up to the
birthday boy and the birthday boy's beloved.

Please advise.
