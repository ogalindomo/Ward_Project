Hi Everybody.

For those who didn't know, Jenny went in for hand surgery this morning.  The 
surgery went well and 
they completed everything today; so she will not have to have a second 
surgery.  She is going to 
spend the night in the hospital, but should be going home tomorrow morning.  
I don't want to overwhelm
her so I am not including her # in this email.  I am sure you all 
understand.  I will be sending some 
flowers on behalf of the SF office Enron Family. 

If you would like to send anything to her house let me know and I will get 
her address for you.

Cheers,
April
