Enron Says Open Grid Would Help California

     Enrons president says utilities outside California are not allowing
power to move freely into that state, aggravating the shortages that sent
power prices soaring this summer. Enron says that the Internet and
computer-based growth in the economy are pushing power demand far beyond
forecasts. Partly because it takes too long to grant approval for new power
plants, California doesn't have enough generation to meet the 14% increase
in
peak demand it experienced since 1996. Utilities that own the transmission
lines outside California are trying to preserve monopolies by hindering
national electricity sellers, like Enron, from moving power into the state.
Wholesale electricity prices surged to as much as 10 times last year's
average during hot weather in California this summer as a result of tight
supplies and growing demand. No significant power plants have been built in
the state in 10 years, and no additional supply is expected to go on line
until the middle of next year. Enron says that because federal energy
regulators have not issued rules to force utilities to open the grid, it is
very difficult to get access to transmission across the US. Enron says it
trades energy in seven regions of the world, and of all the markets where it
does business, the North American electricity market is the most screwed up.
