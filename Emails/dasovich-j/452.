Jeff--my number changed last August, so it should be changed on your 
lists......#612-339-4599 (office)  #612-929-7669 (home)  #1-888-916-2264 
(pager)

I am traveling tonight and will be crazy tomorrow so if you could leave me 
the info via voice mail I'd appreciate it.  As I think I said in my message 
to you, I havn't been totally enthusiastic about anybody that I've 
interviewed in Chicago yet, so I wondered if the firm that you are using in 
California has an office in Chicago and if so, do they have a 
telecom/communications practice?  

Thanks a bunch.

Hi Sue:
Believe it or not. I am alive.  Can get you the info on the outside legal 
counsel I have.  Can you call me Monday morning, since your new phone number 
is NOWHERE to be found.  Best, Jeff
