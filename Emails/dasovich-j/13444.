What happened to the Commission's deference to ongoing legislative efforts to 
address direct access? 

Thinking out loud: Wood's attempt to ram through an order ending DA may be a 
good thing. If he succeeds, doesn't that just prove our point about the 
Commission majority's unreasoning hostility to DA? A closure of DA now only 
affects those currently offering service and I don't know of anyone doing 
that. We need passage of a bill to revive DA one way or another, so that bill 
would override the closure order anyway.

And if Wood fails to end DA, because Brown votes with Bilas and Duque, 
doesn't that set Wood back on his heels?

Subject: RE: CPUC 

The ALJ has confirmed that Commissioner Wood has amended an order about PX 
credit modifications to include an end to direct access and placed it on the 
agenda.? We do not have access to the proposed order to verify the precise 
language.? The order is NOT an order from Commissioner Bilas as the agenda 
improperly suggests.? Parties seeking to retain direct access rights should 
contact Pres. Lynch and Commission Brown in particular, as well as 
Commissioner Duque and Commissioner Bilas.? There is some indication that 
Commission Bilas may prepare an alternate omitting the ban on direct access.

The CPUC is going to consider eliminating direct access at its June 14th 
meeting.? Please spread the word accordingly.
