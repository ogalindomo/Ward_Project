Agghh!

Tried to protest the move, saying that I couldn't make it to the Tuesday
meeting, so she switched me to yet another team - which I will not mention -
that couldn't have been worse if I had hand picked it.  So I told her that a
phone call came in that confirmed I could change my plans and I am back to
the second team - with Courtney, Kimberley, and Anil Sama.  It's a good
team, though not as good as my first!  :)

Oh, well!

I've got an idea.  Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up?  Seriously,
though, I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment.

No problemo!  Maybe I will cook for us next time...oh, that's right I don't
cook anymore...

I thought we did a good job of cranking things out.  Have a good weekend!
