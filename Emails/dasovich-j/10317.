You may have heard about the new survivor series "Down Under".

Well this is my version, I am heading off to Australia equipped with nothing 
more than my faithful companion Alyssa (and laptop) for two weeks.  While 
Down Under I will be forced to endure family and friends, partake in 
primitive ceremonies involving the copious consumption of local fire water.  
Other torturous events include swimming in double-overhead barrelling waves 
with a 6'6" fiber glass floating device, arduous treks across endless 
deserted beaches and hunting the elusive white dimpled ball through kangaroo 
infested rolling greenery.

I leave tomorrow evening, If all goes well I will be back on the 8th of 
April.......wish me luck.

I will be checking phone messages and have access to my email.
