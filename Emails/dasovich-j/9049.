Guys:

Does any know a David Lefkowitz (not sure if this is the correct spelling), 
energy expert from California?  My Florida lawyers informed me that he came 
from California over the weekend and visited with Gov. Jeb Bush regarding 
Florida's wholesale deregulation.  He advised Gov. Bush that he should not 
support moving forward on the recommendations because -- GridFlorida (RTO)  
will not work and Florida will have major problems with stranded cost v. 
stranded benefits.  Gov. Bush allegedly made comments during the meeting that 
he is "very" concerned in light of this information from David.

If any one knows David, please let me know.
