Subject: fERC Agenda


I have been advised that FERC has determined that there is a potential 
conflict beetween the Meeting in San Diego on the 12th and the Commission 
meeting on the 13th.  They are deciding if one should be changed and if so 
which one and when.  As soon as a decision is made they will issue 
appropriate notices and the agenda.  I will keep you informed.
