Rick asked that I prepare an agenda for our 8:00 a.m. calls.  Here is a 
general agenda that will be supplemented as necessary:

1. Review of past day's events.
2. Plan for the day.
3. Identification of needed resources.  
4. Conclusion/Action plan.

Given that these are daily calls, please contact me by telephone at the end 
of day with specifc items to supplement the general agenda.
