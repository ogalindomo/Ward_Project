Just checking to see if you were able to identify gas person for me - Have 
you been able to identify someone who has been active in intrastate 
proceedings?

Thanks!

Subject: Info on California Gas Initiatives

Who has been looking after our interest in the CA PUC competition intiatives 
for Socal/SDG&E and PG&E? I am looking for a good summary of where we are to 
date (cliff notes!).

Please advise.

Regards,

Stephanie
