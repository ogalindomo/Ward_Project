CDWR is still trying to buy from Enron.  What is your view on the current 
regulatory status and its impact on DWR credit quality?

Let's discuss.

We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with 
Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a 
structure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short 
position in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  
I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the 
legal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract 
and the requirements for this potential deal.  Notional terms:

NP-15
