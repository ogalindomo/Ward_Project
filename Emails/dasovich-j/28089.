.????? FERC Responds to California Energy Commissioner's White Paper on 
Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues. Chairman Hebert responded to the May 17, 
2001 letter from California Energy Commission Michal Moore who invited Hebert 
to comment on a draft staff white paper on natural gas infrastructure issues 
by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee. Hebert expressed agreement 
with the white paper's general conclusion the natural gas system in 
California is strained in meeting growing demand. Hebert is encouraged that 
the report recommends, "supporting intrastate system expansions and exploring 
the role that enhanced storage can play in meeting future demand." Comments 
and recommendations from FERC Staff attached to Hebert's letter include 
expanding the discussion on the need for slack pipeline capacity to achieve 
price stability, detailing possible options for shippers to avoid 
interruption, and an examination of possible anti-competitive provisions in 
intrastate tariffs.
