Just because everyone's going on vacation for a few days doesn't mean the
HaasWeek Survivor Contest has ground to a halt.  Yes, HaasWeek is taking a
bit of a vacation - there will be no issue the Monday after Thanksgiving -
but the HW Survivor Contest polls are open for voting, and will be until
next Wednesday at 5:00pm.  There are only three contestants remaining, so
this is your next-to-last chance to influence one of the most critical
decisions the Haas community will face this year.  And there's still a
chance we'll have our Survivor before we know who's the next president of
the United States!

So go to www.haasweek.net and vote now!

Thanks,
HaasWeek
