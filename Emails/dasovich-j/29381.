Jeff -- Here's the info for Monday:

Marathon Communications Inc.
8436 West Third Street, suite 700
Los Angeles 90048
323-655-4660

We'll be meeting with Joan Kradin (svp) and Rich Lichtenstein (president) at 
11 a.m.  I've told them we'll spend a couple of hours going over our issues 
and concerns with California (regulatory, commercial, legal, public 
perception, etc...) as well as our current activities (ENA, EES, etc.) and 
what we'd like to do going forward.   They'll then put together a plan and we 
can get them on retainer by Nov. 1.

What other agencies do we have on retainer? (McNally Temple, the guy who did 
the focus groups, etc.)  Do you know what their monthly retainer is?  I'd 
like to get a sense of what we're already spending.

Looking forward to seeing you Monday.  Have a great weekend!
