Good questions....but I do not know the answers.

I will copy our comrades in Govt Affairs on this email.

Hello again,
Any news regarding the 15/20 rebate in San Diego as applied to DA customers?  
Or rate increases for San Diego?  Do you really think that they will be 
eternally exempt from them?  (I'm hoping to keep the few clients that I've 
signed....)
Good luck......
