> which starts the process of implementing the MOU with the governor and
> DWR.  On April 20th, SCE filed a supplement to 1534-E which it states
> replaces 1534-E in its entirety.  Accordingly the clock for protests was
> reset and protests on the advice filing are now due on May 11th.  The

> On Thursday, April 12th, I forwarded to you a series of Advice filings

> Please pay careful attention to your review of that advice. If we are to
> protest, such protest would be due on May 1.
