Several of you have asked me for another reminder to turn in contributions.  
Earlene and I will go shopping on Thursday morning, so you may continue to 
give contributions to the group gift to Earlene or myself through close of 
business on Wednesday (tomorrow).  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

For those of you who have already contributed as well as those who plan to 
bring an individual gift - thank you - and please forgive the many reminders.

Thanks,
Margo
