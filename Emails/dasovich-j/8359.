Here are the results of the playoffs so far.

Three players have a chance for low: Donna, Barrie and Cameron.  Seven
people have a chance to get in the money for high: Narvco, Ken, Cary, Dave,
Daryl, Prentice and the Commish.  The last of the checks, except for the
Playoffs, have been sent out.  I expect to get picks for the Super Bowl from
at least ten players.  Please don't forget to enter your estimate on total
score, in case of a tie.
