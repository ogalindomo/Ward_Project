Hello Jeff,

 I think this may be the article you are looking for.  I found it in this 
weeks Inside Ferc.  The article is titled, "Western Power Crisis Gives Rise 
to Partisan Politics on Capitol Hill".  It is located on page 1 and continues 
on page 13.  The article describes, inter alia, that the combined states of 
Oregon, Washington, and California have urged President Bush to use a 
wholesale price cap.  This effort was led by Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.  Let me 
know if this helps.

Thanks,



Mike V.
