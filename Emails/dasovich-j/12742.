Subject: Memorial Day Weekend



Cameron and Scotty sitting in a tree  
K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
First comes love 
Then comes  marriage 
Then Prentice and Cammie stop  living together 

;-) 

Congratulations!? You two are fantastic!?  I'm on for the entire weekend and 
will bring mucho vino -- and none from a  box.? Nancy, Triple piggy will have 
to be played on the deck with no  railings.? I've been doing back exercises 
and am good to go.?  

Looking forward to it!
