Here's the pleading that will accompany Alan's affidavit.  We plan, at this 
point, to send a cover letter with this saying that we will be sending our 
responses to Hoecker's questions on Tuesday.  We need this additional time to 
get the input of our commercial people.

The attached is a first draft and no doubt will require editing in spots.  
However, it should provide a conceptual basis for our discussion later this 
afternoon.  Mary, I assume that you'll circulate.  See you in a few hours.
