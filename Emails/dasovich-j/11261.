Subject: Is it true that market participants have not been paying the ISO 
Grid  Managmeent Charge?


I assume that it is true because, on net, all market participants are
owed money by the ISO for power deliveries and ancillary service made
available in November, December, January, etc.  I need to know if my
assumption is on solid ground.  Do you have any opinion (corporate) as
to what this means to the future of the ISO?  My wild guess is that
without money to pay its employees, and other costs, the ship soon
sinks.  Or does it?  This will be a major story probably later this
week, so feed me please.

Also, any comments on Dunn's Senate Committee (State of CA) hearings
that is turning into a witch hunt?
