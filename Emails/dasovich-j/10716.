Dear Haas Community,

Sunday, April 8th, 2001, between 6:00 AM and noon, two servers will be shut
down for maintenance and upgrades.  The NT profile server HCS-MASTER will
be shut down temporarily to begin defragmenting its file system. Also, the
main print server HCS-PRINTER will be shutdown temporarily for the
installation of Web services for that machine.

While HCS-MASTER is down, logon to the NT domain will be possible, but user
profiles will not be available.

Email service should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.  Please note that Helpdesk is not manned on
weekends.  Requests for help logged during the weekend will be responded to
Monday morning.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
