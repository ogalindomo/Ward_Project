Subject: Vacation Advisory


Folks,
[I was going to bring this up in the Staff meeting but since it has been 
cancelled........]

Please be advised that:

1)  I'm taking a few vacation days beginning Wednesday, November 15th through 
Monday, November 20th; 
 returning Tuesday, November 21st.

2) I would like to get a temp to cover for me in my absence; Sue however, 
suggested we be "democratic"
 and put it to a vote; therefore, your thoughts? 

Please get back to me by Friday morning.

Thanks in advance for your consideration,

Joseph
