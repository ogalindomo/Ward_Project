As a further indication of the speed with which FERC is considering projects 
in light of the western energy crisis, they have requested that the U. S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service offices in Phoenix and Albuquerque review the field 
survey results and FERC's Biological Assessment for El Paso's Line 2000 
Project and respond by April 19th.  FERC indicates that the Austin field 
office has already provided its concurrence.  Apparently, the construction 
avoidance time windows for two species will have to be reconsidered in light 
of the new in-service date of August 31st.
