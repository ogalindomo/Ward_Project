Hi guys,

The case for next class (Mon, Feb 28) is posted on the class web site:
http://haas.berkeley.edu/Courses/Spring2000/BA248D/

A couple of tips:

1) The format of the case is for a paper competition, so it may seem longer
than your usual case.
2) The first two questions refer to the case, the third question may require
some research outside the case.
3) I have added a couple of news articles to the web site (see Additional
Readings) that can help you.

Good luck,
