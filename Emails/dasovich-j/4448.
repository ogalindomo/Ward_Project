Attached a revised outline of the issues we discussed Tuesday.  The
outline attempts to go further than the questions posed in the last
agenda outline, but continues to lack detail in many areas.  In most
areas, I have listed various proposals identified in Tuesday's
discussion;  in the case of a couple of areas, however, I have taken
the  liberty to throw out ideas to stimulate further progress in our
discussions.

For those of you working on proposals to fill out the outline, I'd
appreciate an effort to get something back by the end of Monday so we
may begin a discussion during our call on Tuesday.

Thank you all for your efforts.

Evie
