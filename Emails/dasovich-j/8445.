I have a call into Mike Day to draft a response (due 1/26) to the ORA/TURN 
petition to revise the PG&E diversion payback and penalty provisions.  I 
think the position we might want to take is that a crisis is not the time to 
change tariff provisions.  Perhaps waivers are appropriate, but we need to 
look this over carefully.  I will report back once I talk to Mike Day.

Also, Jim and Harry, I assume an RCR will be needed for this, unless you 
already have a blanket one in place for California.  

And this is not going to address the filing PG&E made where it is seeking to 
have SoCalGas buy gas for it.
