Well if that's your position we're clear.  I had already contacted Columbia
Energy and APPA and they were both interested so I'll continue to contact a
couple others.  I think those two offered a total of $5000.  I may get a few
thousand more, but that may all add up to half.  It depends on how long an 
event
and how many speakers we get.

The Dean is still on vacation but hopefully the school will contact you soon.
