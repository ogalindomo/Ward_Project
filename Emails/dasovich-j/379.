SB 1741; Telecommunications:  technology specific area codes, Author: Bowen 
Introduced 2/23/00
Sponsor: Author Sponsor
Summary:
Currently, in California,  area codes cannot be approved based on specific 
technology.
This bill would require the Public Utilities Commission to request authority 
from the Federal Communications Commission to require telephone corporations 
to establish technology specific area codes based on wireless and data 
communications.  This bill would also prohibit the Public Utilities 
Commission from approving new area code splits or overlays unless a 
technology specific area code had been established in the affected area and 
further area code relief is warranted.
