Have you been promoted?  Started a new business?  Changed jobs?  Had a
baby?  Gotten married?

We want to know about it - and so do your fellow classmates!

Just reply to me via email, or call (510) 642-1406, with your news (photos
are welcome, as well) and I will publish it in the February edition of the
Evening News.

Thanks in advance for your help,
