FERC will take up the California investigation?as Item E-2  of next week's 
agenda.? (FERC did formally?raise the possibility of  striking the item from 
the agenda; while this is always a possibility, it is  unusual that FERC 
would expressly so state.)? In addition to the San Diego  complaint and 
FERC's own investigation of the events of this past summer, the  caption also 
encompasses the EOB, CMUA, CARE and Puget complaints, as well as  the 
Reliant/Dynegy complaint dealing with whether the ISO's right to prohibit  
exports during System Emergencies.??
