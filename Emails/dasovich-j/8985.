Excellent find.  I hadn't really paid much attention to the CEO's letter.  We
may want to point this out.  Kind of an uncertainty as to whether it would
happen or not and what the impact would due to HD's cost structure, i.e. boost
lease payments, loss of control over assets, move assets off-balance sheet 
which
could affect debt covenants...

"In addition, we are pursuing sale-and-leaseback negotitations for an
aggregate of approximately $50 million for ten of our stores.  These
sources of additional funds, along with internally generated cash flow
(what internally generated cash flow???), will provide us with an ample
financial foundation to continue to underwrite our growth over the next
several years."

I was thinking that it gives them $50M up front (the sale), and then
they'll only have to make installment payments for the leases.
