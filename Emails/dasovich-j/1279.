The last scheduled department meeting for the Government Affairs-The Americas 
group, for the YEAR 2000, will be Friday, December 8, 2000 in Houston, TX at 
the Doubletreee Hotel.  I have reserved a block of rooms for everyone 
checking in the 7th and departing the 8th.   I also want to inform you that 
the Enron Corp. Holiday Party will be held on Saturday, December 9 here in 
Houston which will give those of you travelling in the opportunity to attend, 
if you wish.    

Questions you might have regarding the party.

1.  Are spouses invited? (? for employees outside of Houston)  Yes, but at 
the employee's expense (ie:airfare).

2. Will Enron pay for the extra 2 nights at the hotel?  Yes, if you can 
demonstrate that, even with the additional 2 nights stay, plus your airfare,  
it will still be cheaper than a flight leaving the evening of the 8th.   A 
lot of times airfare will be much cheaper with a weekend stayover.

Example: (a)  Round trip airfare (returning 12/8/00)  = $800.00 (airfare only)

Example: (b) Two additional nights at  hotel =     $500.00 (airfare w/a 
weekend stay)
                  $218.00 (hotel 2/additional nights)
                                 Total = $718.00

3. Will Enron pay for additional meals for the weekend?  No.  Meals will be 
on your own.

If you are interested in staying the weekend, please let me know.  There are 
individuals that need to be contacted with this information.

Please mark your calendars and call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
