I sensed the same thing.  Sue's been calling me -- sort of freaking out over 
documents etc.  Not sure why.  I'm here for about 20 more minutes and then I 
have to go to a lunch/baby shower for one of the gals here.  Call me on the 
cell if you don't get me at work.  713-851-3778 cell.

Hi:
I'm going to call you in a bit--I'm on a conference call right now.  We need 
to coordinate just a wee bit.  Landwehr's all over Rosie, and we're getting 
mixed up between her RGA meetings and the CA meetings. I talked to her a 
little this AM and expressed a concern that we not get poor Rosie all wrapped 
around an axle and confused.  We may have several points of contact here for 
various issues.  No big deal, but I want to make sure things don't get more 
complicated than they need to be.  I'll forward you a note from Sue to Rosie 
(and me) that you weren't on.  Also want to talk about your voicemail last 
night--i.e., I may need to travel with KL, which is fine by me if that's 
necessary.

Best,
Jeff
