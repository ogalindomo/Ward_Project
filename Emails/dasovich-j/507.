Attached is a proposed agenda for Monday's meeting at CMTA's offices
in Sacramento. I haven't been able to reach everyone to confirm who's
attending, so please call or email me with any corrections to the
list (or with any other comments, for that matter).

Otherwise, looking forward to seeing you on Monday - John
