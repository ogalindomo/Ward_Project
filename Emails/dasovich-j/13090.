Colleagues:

The first draft of the accomplishments for GA has been discussed with Rick 
and Jim this morning.   Although most of the inputs were there, some 
important ones were still missing.

The second draft is planned for Friday June 1st, and the final for June 8th.  
The week difference between 1st, and 8th will be spent entirely on  
addressing the appropriate methodologies to arrive at the dollar value for 
your work/accomplishment.  I promise that you--each for her/his 
accomplishments --shall be personally involved in determining the appropriate 
methodology so that to reflect your work in the most accurate manner.  
Accordingly, I would appreciate very much that all your accomplishments 
should reach me as soon as possible so that to allocate as much time for 
methodology and communication with you.  A report is currently being prepared 
of the compiled methodologies submitted so far and I shall send it you with 
the hope that it will be of help.

I also want to communicate that the process of sending your accomplishments 
is not really voluntary;  it is PRC related.  Therefore, I am really seeking 
your help and support to complete this task.  

Of course, please let me know if you have any question or I can be of any 
help.

Subject: GA accomplishments for the period November 2000 - April 2001

Colleagues:

I am seeking your help to compile the accomplishment for GA during the period 
Nov 2000 - April 2001.  Of course, these accomplishments are the summation of 
your efforts either individually or through your group, and the total shall 
indicate the contribution of GA to the corporate objectives of Enron.  The 
aggregation of your inputs shall be one of the primary sources that Rick and 
Steve will use in communicating GA impact to all stakeholders in the 
company.  

I would like to suggest to use the attached excel file to document your 
accomplishment for the period.  I hope that it shall assist you to identify 
your contribution, your estimate of value, and a line, or two, explaining the 
methodology you used to arrive at your value.    

I hope to receive your inputs by  May 16th (next Wednesday), so that I can 
compile the inputs and issue the first draft for discussion by Monday 21st.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.
