Hi Jeff:
I know a Jeff Dasovich, exact spelling, an attorney in
Oklahoma City...I'm looking forward to talking to you about
the potential for vineyard. Please call me at 707-964-1155,
I zoom around pretty fast but should be able to get down
there soon. Do you have soil test results/temp profiles -
were you referred to me by Alan Green of Greenwood Ridge?  Sally
