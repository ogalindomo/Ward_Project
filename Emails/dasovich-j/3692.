Congratulations to Dave, Mickey, Mike & Lisa (second week in a row for them)
and Pat for coming in 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th respectively.  Cameron is still
holding onto first place by a slim margin over Brady.  There are only twelve
points separating fourth and tenth place.  Another close race is for last
place (sorry there's no prize for this) and Prentice and Daryl seem to be
fighting to avoid this distinction.
