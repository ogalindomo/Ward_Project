All:

Attached is a brief memo describing the hearing.  One notable event that came 
out of today's hearing is that Bill Wise will take the stand tomorrow 
afternoon to answer questions from the Judge (and possibly other parties)  on 
the February 14 presentation regarding the EPME acquisition of the EPNG 
capacity.
