Attached is a history of inaction by the CPUC in regards to long-term 
contracts. We are graphically portraying this as a timeline, incorporating 
the quotes.

We would like to also incorporate any public long-term contract offers IEP 
members made that utilities were not able to enter into because of the CPUC. 
?This will once again help reinforce that IEP members are part of the 
solution. ?

Please forward this information, or any other comments, to me or Katie by 8am 
PST, Thursday April 26.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jean
