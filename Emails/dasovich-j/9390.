Sorry this is late getting out.? Server went  down Friday and now my email 
doesn't work, so sending this from home.? Hope  it makes it to everyone.

The attached file shows a comparison of California  electric rates for 
commercial and residential customers with rates for similar  customers in 
neighboring states.? The results show California customers'  rates 
significantly higher with the difference narrowing in 2000.? Data for  
2000?reflects a usage weighted average for the 1st 8 months.? Some  data was 
not available for all utilities.? Data is from PowerDat and is  generally 
consistent with data reflected in EIA's data base.
