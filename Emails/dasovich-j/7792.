Subject: Level Setting Meeting for the California Markets Focus Group

A California Markets Focus Group meeting will be held daily starting 
tomorrow, December 15th.  Please plan to attend this meeting starting at 
10:00 a.m.  to be held in conference room EB 2868.   

This will be a level setting meeting to determine what topics should be 
reviewed with the group on a daily basis.   This forum will also allow for an 
overview of changes in market prices, positions and identify strategies.   
The recurring time and location of these daily meetings will be determined 
tomorrow as well.  

Participation by you (or your pre-identified representative)  in these 
meetings on a daily basis is critical.  We will be preparing a report for the 
EES G-9 daily and your input is required. 

Any questions, please call Wanda Curry @ x-33411.

Thanks
