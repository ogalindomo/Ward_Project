Subject: Gov wants to meet with generators


An excerpt from a SD Union Tribune article this morning, and I quote:


The governor will spend most of this month signing and vetoing hundreds of
bills passed by the Legislature before adjournment last week. He said he
will meet with power generators and "immerse" himself in the electricity
issue next month before proposing reforms in November.

"If people don't act responsibly I am going to name names and publish a list
out in my reception area," Davis said. "We have to do this together."

The governor said that ratepayers, utilities and power generators will all
have to "accept their fair share of pain." He called on all Californians,
including businesses and environmentalists, to act responsibly to bring
electricity supply and demand into balance.

Hinting at reforms, Davis said there may have to be a restructuring of the
industry-dominated Independent Systems Operator, created under deregulation
to run the transmission system and make some power purchases needed to keep
the grid operating.

"Over time I think deregulation will reduce bills," Davis said. "I wasn't
part of putting it in place. I have inherited this. But I believe it can
work."
