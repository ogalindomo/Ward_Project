Attached are PG&E's Reply Comments in the PG&E California Gas Transmission
open season docket, A.01-06-020.

After readying the "hardcopy" comments for service by U.S. Mail, a couple of
typos came to our attention.  We have corrected the typos in this e-mail.

This e-mail contains two files:

1.  A "redline" version showing typo corrections/changes from the hardcopy
version sent out by U.S. Mail.

1.  A file showing the redlines "accepted."
