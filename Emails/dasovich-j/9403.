One more thank you, too.

Teaching a class like speech lets me get to know you in ways other
professors don't.  I appreciated your openness, as well as your engagement,
during the two days of our class.

And I mean it when I say I want to work with you in the future.  If you
need any communication advice, or wish more feedback on your efforts in
class, please contact me.

Take care, all of you.  It was a pleasure meeting you.

Bill
