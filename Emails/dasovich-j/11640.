Rosalee/Maureen,

We are going to do our best to pull materials together for Ken's briefing 
book by Friday cob so that Ken will have them to review and provide us 
feedback.  I'll keep you posted on how we're doing.  

Separately, Steve mentioned scheduling a pre-briefing before Ken leaves 
Houston.  This meeting would primarily include: Ken, Steve and Jeff 
Dasovich.  If you haven't already, will the two of you set some time aside 
for the guys to go over the briefing book and details of the schedule next 
week? Tuesday, if possible,  would be best (in case we need Monday to finish 
up briefing book materials).    

thank you!
