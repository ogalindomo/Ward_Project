Executive Team:

By now I trust you have had a chance to review the following briefing
materials:

> Olympus Quick Tour CD-ROM
> Navigation Exercise
> Section I of the Olympus simulation manual
> Harvard Business Review articles:
1. "Introduction to Financial Ratios and Financial Statement Analysis"
2. "Assessing a Company's Future Financial Health"
3. "What is Strategy"
4. "Customer Intimacy and Other Value Disciplines"


During our pre-session meeting next week, we will be exploring in greater
detail the Olympus simulation environment. As you are aware from the agenda,
we will be immersed in the simulation over the weekend.

The following link is to an additional article from McKinsey Quarterly which
I think captures well the strategic and financial issues you'll face in the
Olympus simulation.
