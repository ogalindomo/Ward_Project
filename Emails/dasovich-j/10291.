Some of the interconnection agreements that we are looking at, have metrics 
for performance.  However, those metrics are specific to how the ILEC 
performs with regard to the CLEC.  I believe those metrics are confidential 
between the parties to the interconnection agreement.  Once we sign 
agreements, we will receive reports from the ILECs on their performance 
relative to us, in a very limited way.  We would not receive information 
relative to that ILECs performance for any other carrier.

Subject: Re: Network Performance and Reliability  

Hi Dung,

I haven't seen anything with performance or reliability metrics.  I'll send 
this around to the other people in our group to see if they've seen anything.

Sue,

We're looking at evaluating our network metrics vs. other carriers.  Most of 
the information I have found 
centers on reach (i.e. miles of fiber, presence, etc.) as opposed ot 
performance or reliability.  Has anything 
crossed your attention in the Regulatory space that looks at this type of 
issue?

Dung
