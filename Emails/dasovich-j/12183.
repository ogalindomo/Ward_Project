Word from Senator Burton's office today is that the deadlock on SB 28x has
been broken.  There is agreement that the measure, which makes several
changes to the siting process including IEP-sponsored proposals, will be
sent back to the Assembly to be stripped of the controversial unemployment
insurance provisions.  If all goes according to plan (and I known I've said
this before), the Assembly will pass the bill out again and send it back to
Senate for concurrence which is also expected to pass it out.

The attached is a summary of the bill as it stands today.  Nothing other
than the unemployment insurance provisions will be touched.

I'll keep you posted.
