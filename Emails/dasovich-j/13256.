Mirant and Duke Pull In

Mirant and Duke are trying to shut down Gary Ackerman of the WPTF.  This 
appears to be coming directly from Gov Davis.  Mirant admitted that Gov Davis 
had pressured them to shut down Gary (presumably as part of Mirant's recently 
completed negotiations over a long-term power sale). Mirant said it may be 
leaving WPTF if it doesn't get its way.  Reliant was also talking general 
caution.  So far, the majority of WPTF members are holding firm.  Gary will 
continue his outreach with media but curb the use of any inflammatory 
language.

Reliant's FallOut From Advertising

Reliant has run a bit of image advertising in CA in a few newspapers.  They 
were contacted by an organization that supposedly represents black-owned 
newspapers. The organization will begin running a campaign against Reliant 
saying the company is racist and should be boycotted.

Direct Access and the Dems (through Alliance for Retail Markets contacts)

The Governor's office has said that "you'll get direct access, but you won't 
like it" and mentioned requiring DA customers to pick up $3.5 billion in 
"overcharges"  --  "You people wanted deregulation and are responsible for 
the way it turned out, so now you have to pay for it."  Sen. Burton(Majority 
Leader) said that its "too soon" for direct access. And Sen. Bowen's (chair 
Senate Energy Com) energy advisor said "There will never be an unfettered 
right to direct access, so don't keep pushing for it." AReM will step up 
efforts to educate the Dems and attempt to get a powerful Dem to champion the 
cause.  Also, three separate rumor sources said that Loretta Lynch is moving 
ahead on her own, without Davis' approval, and that the Governor's office is 
in a tizzy about it -- even thinking of politically-correct ways to get her 
out of there -- judgeships anyone?
