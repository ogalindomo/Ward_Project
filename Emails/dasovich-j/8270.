Attached is the draft IEP Filing at FERC Request  For Rehearing on?the FERC's 
December 15 Order as it pertains to QFs.?  Preparation of this document was 
originally discussed with the IEP  Restructuring/Transmission Task Force on 
December 20, 2000.? The Filing is  due on January 15.? During the conference 
call, the consensus appeared to  be that the most important issues for IEP to 
address related to QFs and the  loose language in the Order 
interpreting/implementing PURPA.
?
As this document primarily addresses QF issues, we  will be adding this draft 
filing to the agenda for the QF Contracts/SRAC Task  Force conference call 
rescheduled for 11:30 a.m.? on Thursday, January  11.?Depending on interest, 
we may also discuss this draft filing on the IEP  Restructuring/Transmission 
Task Force previously scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on  Friday, January 12 to 
address, among other things, the FERC Market Power  Mitigation Technical 
Conference scheduled for January  23.
