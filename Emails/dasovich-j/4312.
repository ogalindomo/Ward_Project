I have posted more practice problems for the final on the web page.  I did
the solutions in a hurry to get these problems up in time to be useful.
PLEASE email me if you think I have made a mistake.

I have made the final exam easier by removing the hardest problem.... you
should still prepare well.  My guess is that you will find it to be harder
than the midterm.
