LOS ANGELES - Denouncing the fact that there is currently no oversight or=

the Governor and his administration, Secretary of State Bill Jones totals=
=20
called on State Controller Kathleen Connell to begin an immediate full and=

complete audit of all energy-related financial transactions. As chief=20
financial of officer for the state, the controller has the sole=20
responsibility to "provide sound fiscal control over both receipts and=20
disbursements of public funds and to determine legality and accuracy of eve=
ry=20
claim against the state."

"There is no oversight and no accountability to ensure that the taxpayers' =
=20
money is being spent wisely," Jones sad. "The enormous outlays of money to=
=20
purchase energy on a daily basis as well as these binding long-terrn=20
contracts will have a tremendous fiscal impact on the state for years to co=
me=20
- I believe essentially, mortgaging our future for our children and=20
grandchildren."

Additionally, Jones called on Governor Davis to immediately meet with=20
legislative bi-partisan leaders to brief them fully as to the terms and cos=
ts=20
of all contracts and purchases on the spot market just as the President's=
=20
team meets with congressional leaders to discuss issues of
national security.

Jones also strongly urged the Governor to begun monthly briefings immediate=

power plant construction and an up-to-date report of California's power=20
supplies to ensure adequate resources for the upcoming summer months

"The Governor believes that the solution to our energy crisis lies in the=
=20
state getting into the power business - I do not. As a result, Davis has=20
created a de-facto state Power Authority that's spending cash at an alarmin=
g=20
rate, some $45 million a day; $1.5 billion a month," said Jones. "And he's=
=20
just signed the state up for some $43 billion in long-tern contracts for=20
which we don't know the terms, length or total energy supply secured."=20

Jones noted that when the utility companies were regulate the Public=20
Utilities Commission (PUC) had the responsibility to look over their should=

and ensure that the ratepayers were protected and fairly treated. Yet all t=

governmental agencies that should be looking into the energy spending spree=

Hoover Commission, the Electricity Oversight Board, the Department of=20
Finance, the Resources Agency, the Department of Water Resources, the Energ=

Exchange.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal article (3/08/01), David Mills,=
=20
trading floor manager of the Bonneville Power A.dndnistation questioned=20
Califomia's purchases on the spot market, saying that the water agency=20
[California Departnent of Water Resources] has at times offered to pay $50 =

=20
that power buyers for the state "agree to prices that make you wonder =06? =
you?d=20
at least think they?d check to see what the prevailing price is before=20
throwing out their offer."=20

"As President Bush has said so often, it's not the government's money, it's=

the people's money" Jones sa=06=15d.  "The people of California deserve to =

what the terms of this high-stakes energy game are since it's being played=

with taxpayers' money."

Jones criticized the governor?s repeated refusal to fulfill numerous Public=

several news media and other organizations, calling his denial for=20
information based on a government code provision regarding protection of th=

"I believe that the real =01@public interest' lies in a full accounting to =

we're actually getting," Jones concluded.
