Thanks for talking to me about this article for this Friday's eBiz.

Please read it over and let me have comments tomorrow morning (Thursday). it
goes live 5 p.m. Thursday evening.

Sorry for AOL -- my Notes is wreaking havoc today.

(Jeff -- Steve confirmed that the report said power sellers did not exercise
market power or price gouging, so I put it in the article.)

Take care,
Jeannie
