Glad to be of help.  Glad to hear it went well.  Someone sent me some press 
on the hearing that looked great.

Subject: Thank you

thanks for your help in preparing for the Texas hearing.  I think Texas 
legislators are viewing the California experience in the proper context and I 
think I was at least marginally articulate on the emissions issues as well.

thanks again.
