Dear Jeff,

We have very strong registrations for the Energy Restructuring in
California conference and will have a very interesting audience in addition
to our excellent faculty.

Here is an easy way to let your clients, colleagues, and associates know
about the  conference and your role as a member of the faculty. Simply
delete the first part of this email message and forward the remainder to
the people of your choice. Feel free to edit the message.

This is a service we offer to faculty members who want to help publicize
the conference. It is not a requirement.

Best regards,

Karl Craine
Executive Director
