Greetings:
For those of you who have seen the FERC order you may also be interested in
looking at the staff report, which is summarized in Appendix D of the order
but attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  I have split it up into 3
e-mails and 7 PDF files so that those of you having trouble getting large
files will be able to open it.

You can also find the FERC filing, Staff Report, and press release at:

http://www.caiso.com/pubinfo/recent.html

Let me know if you need anything else.  We will be issuing a summary by
Friday of the report.

Thanks,
Katie Kaplan
