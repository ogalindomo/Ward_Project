Attached is an updated version of the application matrix.  I've changed 
Michigan to "approved" but don't yet have an approval date to plug in.  Also, 
I've added comments to Ohio.

Please note updated information on CT:  Draft decision issued 10/4; comment 
period to end 10/11;  final approval due 10/11.

Thanks so much for your prompt response and additional feedback.  Let me know 
if you have any questions.
