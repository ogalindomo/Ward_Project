Due to the absence of any large consumer presence in the GRC, I had asked 
Phyllis if we might be able to encourage the MEUG group to do something to 
support the proposed decision (ie. letter to the Commission, meetings w/ the 
Commissioners, press) saying high rates are bad.  I've put together a 
summary, which is a first draft and wordy, but would appreciate comments on 
making it snappy.  This is for internal distribution and comment at this 
point.  Let me know your thoughts asap.  Thanks.
