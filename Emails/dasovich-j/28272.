The attached CPUC press release says that the Commission is delaying until  
mid-August any action on the suspension of direct access.? This is  
reportedly being done at the request of DWR,?the Department of Finance, and  
the State Treasurer's Office.? The  extension will, "allow the agencies more 
time to address any unresolved issues  and, ultimately, provide interested 
parties ample opportunity for review and  comment."
?
We need to keep up the pressure.? This fight is not?over  yet.
