Tim,

Jim Steffes, Steve Walton, Jeff Dasovich and I have put together a concept 
proposal on a simplified measurement of  the benefits of an interconnected 
West.  We are trying to put some numeric meat on our statements that "closing 
California's doors" will be costly to California and the rest of the West.

At the end of this proposal is a set of data requirements.  Rather than use 
external consultants, we would like to get the data from West Fundamentals.  
Thus, we are seeking your buy-in.

Please review the attached.  If you have questions, perhaps we could discuss 
Wed at the end of our call to discuss your Santa Fe presentation.

Alan Comnes
