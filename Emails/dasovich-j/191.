To Whom it May Concern:
  
Jeff Dasovich, Government Affairs, San Francisco, CA, returned a new Armada 
3500 laptop
(which is now at Julie Bechtel's desk (EB4558C)) for repair.  He has decided 
to keep his *current* laptop,
as it is functioning properly.

Therefore, we do not need or want it returned to him or our department.  
Thanks, however, 
for all your efforts in getting it checked and/or repaired.  Apologies for 
any inconvenience this may
have caused.

If you have any questions regarding the above, you may speak to Hans Maverick 
of Houston Tech Support,
or myself at (415) 782-7841. 

Thanks again,

Joseph Alamo
Sr. Admin. Asst.
State Government Affairs
