PG&E is saying publicly (and the news is reporting) that PG&E has $500 
million in cash, and it's payables are $583 M.

		 Subject: PG&E Can't Make Next PX Payment

I have been informed that PG&E announced at the CPUC hearing yesterday that 
it will not be able to make its next payment to the PX.  It owes $500+ 
million.
