Dear Haas Community,

Sunday Oct 1st, 2000 between 0600 and noon several Haas  servers will be
shut down for planned  maintenance and upgrades.  Servers will include
the  Windows Internet Name Servers and the Backup Domain Controllers.

Services affected will be NT domain name resolution, and logon services to
the Haas NT domain.  These services will be generally available during the
maintenance period, but may
be slower than usual, and may experience brief (15 min) periods of
interruption.  These degradations will impede your ability to logon the  NT
domain and to map Network drives.

Email services should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
