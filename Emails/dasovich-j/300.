Hi Tom:  I'm in the government affairs office in San Francisco and saw your 
presentation to the group last year.  I just got a call from someone who 
apparently has a lot of capacity available and wants to know if he can 
somehow exploit Enron's bandwidth trading platform to market it.   Is there 
someone I can have him get in touch with to find out if it's possible?  Best, 
Jeff
