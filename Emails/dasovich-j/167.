Mike, attached are the parameters that we would prefer to see in an RFP for 
the electrical commodity in California.  This approach in any RFP would help 
us get the best bid possible for a solicitation.

I understand from our converstaion of last week that Edwards is contemplating 
adding the electrical commodity to the RFP that is intended to be used for 
privatization of the Edwards electrical distribution system.  Given this, we 
have put our jurisdictional discussions with the CPUC on hold pending your 
resolution of the content of the RFP.  We cannot request any dispositive 
action from the commission on jurisdiction until we can accurately 
characterize the elements of the transaction.  Please advise us, as early as 
possible whether or not the commodity will be included, and if so, how its 
inclusion will be structured.
