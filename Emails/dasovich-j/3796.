Hello Jeff,

Please see attached, my attempt at questions 1 and 2 of the next
case.  Feel free to use the set up in question 1 to answer question 3.  1
and 3 are very similar - 1 compares what Global Industries does compared to
German GAAP, 3 compares it to US GAAP.  There is not much information on
German GAAP so I used a little artistic licence.

Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense - I am a little cloudy right
now with this cold.

Cheers,
