Good luck on the calls everyone.  If Monday doesn't work for the speaker you
call, ask if another day that week works.  Thursday is the second best based 
on
parking, etc. On Monday night it looks like the school can't host a dinner
afterwards because of another function.

How is Monday 9/11 at 5 Eastern/2 Pacific to see how we're doing?
