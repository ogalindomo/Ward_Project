FYI, after some analysis and internal communication, we've decided to 
increase the standard term options.  The SDG&E Daily Price Sheet will now
exhibit Enron offers for 3,4 and 5 year terms, with all terms ending in May 
of the final contract year.  The value of the 2 year (18 months) term is a 
hard sell and comprises only a small portion of concluded deals.  The new 
terms should address this issue and provide a backdrop of more aggressive 
prices.  Keep in mind that if you have customers requesting the 2 year price, 
it's not a problem.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not 
hesitate to call.   

Regards,
Marcus
