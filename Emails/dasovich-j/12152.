A first draft of your comments is attached for your review and changes.
If you can make the changes on the attached document and e-mail it back
it would be very helpful and make our job much easier.  We would like to

have this ready by mid-June so a quick turnaround would be appreciated.
Your complimentary copy will be in the mail when is comes off the
press.  Thanks for your assistance.  Tish and John
