I say we launch on ISO governance soon, preferably through EPSA, but alone if 
necessary. We need to force FERC's hand with a well-thought out pleading on 
why they have to enforce order on independent governance and why a 
politicized CAL ISO is a recipe for disaster. Are we waiting on anything I'm 
not aware of?

Subject: Cal ISO Not Filing CM Proposal at FERC - EPMI Response?

Mary informs me that the Cal ISO has filed (1-30-01) with FERC that it will 
not be filing a new Congestion Management proposal at FERC as required in 
previous Orders.

She thinks now is an opportune time to challenge the legitimacy of the new 
Cal ISO Board (Gov Davis' actions).   I also think that we need to put 
forward our own solution (if we have one).

I would appreciate everyone's opinion as to the (a) likelihood that FERC 
would finally address the matter, (b) end result if FERC does deal with the 
issue, (c) and the politics in Sacramento / CPUC of taking this position.  
Also, who else is going to weigh in on our proposal?

Jim
