Hi Everyone,  

I just spoke with Joe Edwards about interconnection agreements with ILECs in 
states where we have CLEC authority.  Joe was very appreciative of having our 
group take the lead on this issue.  We'll be providing guidance in 
understanding how these agreements work, identifying the best starting point 
for negotiation and then participating in the negotiations along with Joe's 
group.

Joe would like to see copies of the sample PacBell agreements that we have 
for California.  He also is interested in seeing agreements for SBC in Texas, 
Verizon in NY and NJ, and US West in Oregon.

Donald:  I'm hoping you will lead this effort.  Can you give me a call to 
talk about how we should approach it?

Jeff:  Can you send Joe the disc you forwarded to Scott, Donald and I a while 
ago for California?  

Marchris and Margo:  Can you get copies of interconnection agreements SBC has 
signed in Texas?

Margo:  When you talk to Andrew Fischer this afternoon, can you ask him for 
copies of interconnection agreements that Verizon has signed in New York?

Thanks,

Sue
