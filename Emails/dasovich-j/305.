Jeff:
Pat tells me you have comments.  Here is the draft agenda I mailed out in 
Dec.  I am trying to gather all comments this week in hopes of getting a 
"final" draft agenda out early next week.  So any comments today or tomorrow 
would be timely.


It is looking like we will rearrange the time frames so that Telcom issues 
will be on Day 1 and Gas/Elec Issues and the panels that relate to both will 
be on Day 2.
