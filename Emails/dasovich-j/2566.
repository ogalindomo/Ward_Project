Thanks so much for the gifts.  Very sweet.  Sorry I was rushed, but I've
got a big bad finance midterm on Tuesday that I ain't ready for and work's
nuts.  But I really want to hear more about the trip.  Sounds like it was a
blast.

You looked lovely in the pictures, all dressed up a la l'Italienne, and you
look lovely in your everyday sweatshirt and jeans, too.  (Don't sweat it.)

Prentice and I were planning on going to the Shea's tonite.  You guys
going?

Also, I'd love to talk to you this weekend if possible about Prentice's
bday festivities.
