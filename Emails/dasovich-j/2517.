Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for your input on the website. I am incorporating your
suggestions. It will be posted, with more color and polish, by tomorrow
morning. After you review it again, I will link it to the GSPP website, and
make it public.

I have just received final confirmation from Dean Laura Tyson as Moderator
of the first panel session.

Have a good afternoon/evening.

Best wishes,
Heather
