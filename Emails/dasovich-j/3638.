Attached is a first draft of WPTF's response to the FERC's November 1  
Order.? Please note that there are several areas where parties are asked to  
provide more information to substantiate and bolster the contentions made in 
the  filing.
?
Most importantly, please also note that the questions distributed by  
Chairman Hoecker subsequent to the San Diego meeting are  not the same 
questions we discussed at the 11/15 Board  meeting.? They ask for detailed 
data which I do not have and will require  input from WPTF members.? Rather 
than attempting to answer these questions  in this first draft, I suggest we 
confer by phone on 11/20 with regard to how to  pull this information 
together.? Alternatively, anyone who wants to take a  shot at one or more of 
the questions will be greatly appreciated and awarded a  free life-time 
subscription to the Burrito.
?
Also, several parties indicated at the Board meeting that our filing should  
reference material which has not yet been sent to me.? Prime among these  are 
the John Stout material and graphs on BFM activity which?are supposed  to be 
on the ISO website.? If folks think this material would be helpful to  
include, I would appreciate having it sent to me with recommendations for how 
it  should be used.
?
As a reminder, the filing is due on Wednesday the 22nd, so we have some  time 
to productively improve this draft on Monday and Tuesday.? Thanks for  your 
anticipated help and assistance . . . and have a good weekend!
