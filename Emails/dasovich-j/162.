My travel agent is sending me some brochures.  1-800-cruises called back with
more info too.  I will look at it all when I get back and we can discuss.
What about dinner out? Do we still want to do that? If so, dates that work
for you all?

Have a great time at Mom's party next week.  Add my best wishes for any and
all toasts.
