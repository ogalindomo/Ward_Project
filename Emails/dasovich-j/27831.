This is a reminder (a) to reply if you haven't already (or to update your 
reply if your plans have changed) and (b) that the party in honor of Bob's 
arrival in SF for the summer is occurring tomorrow, Friday, 6/15, at 
5:30pm.   See the Evite for details.

Please wear something fetching in a lawn-party sort of way, or perhaps 
something hideously ugly and unflattering.  No banal clothing will be 
permitted.

Hope to see you then!
