Yes on regulatory.  Discussion, not power point, followed by Q&A.  Kirk will 
send to you via email by noon your time an agenda and possibly a couple of 
graphics to guide the discussion.  Can you distribute to the group when you 
get them?  Does getting them by noon work OK?

Subject: hey

just want to be sure that kirk is planning to walk us through the regulatory 
situation with regard to ERCs and RECLAIM and then available for Q&A.  Is he 
planning a power point or will it be discussion?  Did he provide youwith an 
agenda?
