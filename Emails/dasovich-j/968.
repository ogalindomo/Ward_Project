Your request to Majordomo@haas.berkeley.edu:

 subscribe alumnijobs "Jeff Dasovich" <jdasovic@enron.com>

has been forwarded to the owner of the "alumnijobs" list for approval.
This could be for any of several reasons:

    You might have asked to subscribe to a "closed" list, where all new
 additions must be approved by the list owner.

    You might have asked to subscribe or unsubscribe an address other than
 the one that appears in the headers of your mail message.

When the list owner approves your request, you will be notified.

If you have any questions about the policy of the list owner, please
contact "alumnijobs-approval@haas.berkeley.edu".


Thanks!
