Dear Students,

Multex, the analyst reports database, is now accessible off-campus, thanks
to persistent prodding on several fronts.

Again, if you are behind a firewall, you may have trouble getting into any
of our electronic databases other than our UC catalog. And, you must
proxy-configure your browsers to our proxy server. For those
who are still wondering, how-to instructions including password and
username instructions are at http://proxy.lib.berkeley.edu.
