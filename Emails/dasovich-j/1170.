SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The timetable for deregulation of Nevada's 
electricity market will be examined at a special meeting Sept. 13, called by 
Gov. Kenny Guinn (R) with state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Chairman 
Don Soderberg, a spokesman for Guinn said Wednesday. 
Nevada's electricity market was to open to competition last March but Guinn 
delayed the timing because final rules weren't in place.

The state's new timetable now calls for deregulation to be phased in for 
various classes of utility customers from Nov. 1, 2000, for big industrial 
companies, to residential consumers by the end of 2001. 
Soderberg told Reuters the timetable is subject to the governor's approval. 
"I have no indication that he is uncomfortable with the schedule, but we will 
meet to discuss all issues on deregulation," he said. 
The state PUC has studied the power problems Nevada's neighbour California 
has grappled with since electricity deregulation went into effect in 1998. 
Soderberg said, however, that California's problems, which are based mainly 
on supply and demand factors, don't necessarily mean that Nevada will delay 
further.
