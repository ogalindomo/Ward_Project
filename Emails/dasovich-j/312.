Jeff, I am in the process of getting the Articles of Inc. for Enron 
Telecommunications, Inc. and the Cert. of Status as Foreign Corporation from 
CA Sec. of State.  This is a Delaware corp. and the offices were closed 
because of the snow storms.  I will keep you posted.  Robin Hill

Subject: Next Steps for California Filing

Greetings All:
When we spoke with Bowen, et al last week, we determined that there were some 
deliverables that Enron needed to pull together before we could get the 
application in order for filing.  According to my notes, those include:

Articles of Incorporation--Steve
Cert. of Status as Foreign Corporation from CA Sec. State--Steve 
Pro Forma Balance Sheet--Scott/Steve/Todd Henney (sp?)
Customer Base Estimates--Scott
Bank Letter Confirming 100K in liquid assets--Scott/Steve
Modifications to the price list, etc., in the draft AFTS 
tariff--Scott/Steve/Rebecca Lynch
Biographies of Key Management--Scott

We also talked about trying to have another call either on Tuesday or 
Wednesday.  

Two questions:  
What's the status of pulling together our internal deliverables?
Does it make more sense to get the deliverables pulled together first, before 
we have another call?

Best,
Jeff
