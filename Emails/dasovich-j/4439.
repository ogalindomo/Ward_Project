The ISO has just made this filing with FERC.  We will review and summarize
shortly.  Please give me a call with questions.

 This filing asks for three actions:
 - $250 soft cap with cost justification to go above;
- Allocation of OOM to under scheduled load and overscheduled generation;
and
- penalties for Participating Generators who fail to follow ISO Dispatch
> instructions.
This action sunsets when FERC's expected order on the California markets
becomes effective.


Thanks,
