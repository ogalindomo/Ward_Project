Dear Mr. Dasovich,

Power & Water conference: Water is a critical path for every energy project
and this year it has become more important than ever. A new administration
adds yet another complicating factor to the Pacific Northwest's water and
energy uncertainties. This program's distinguished faculty, including
Judity Johansen (now CEO of PacifiCorp) and former Senator Slade Gordon,
will provide insights that will help anyone dealing with water and energy
supply issues to move more surely through these troubled times.

When/Where: August 16 & 17 at the Renaissance Madison Hotel in Seattle.

Program Co-chairs: Randall J. Hardy of Hardy Energy Consulting and
Elizabeth Thomas of Preston Gates & Ellis LLP.
