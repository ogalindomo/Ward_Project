Hi -

Shawne Robinson & I are both fans of a certain well-known East Coast
basketball team (no jeers please!).  The Warriors host the Knicks on
March 26th in Oakland at 7:30 pm.  So, in celebration of our first
"Spring Break" in the program, we want to check if people are interested
in
going to the game.

Shawne has arranged for a group price discount of $27 a seat.  Please
let either of us know by this Friday if you want to be included in the
headcount and how many tickets you will need.  We will order tickets
this week - please drop a check for your tickets into either of our
mailboxes at school by Wednesday of next week.

Hope to see you there!


Lisa O'Connor
