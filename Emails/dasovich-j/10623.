Public Power Renewable Energy Action Team Launched; Non-Profit Center for 
Resource Solutions Assumes Management Responsibilities

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 3, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Municipal utilities in California have come together behind renewable 
resources. Volatile electricity markets are making renewable energy 
increasingly
cost-effective, and a team of municipal utilities plans to deploy
renewable resources as a means to ensure the continued competitiveness
of public power. 

The Center for Resource Solutions (CRS), a non-profit
organization based in San Francisco, has assumed management and
organizational responsibilities for the group, which is called the
Public Power Renewable Energy Action Team (PPREAT). Key supporters of
PPREAT include the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, City of
Anaheim, Northern California Power Agency and many other municipal
utilities in California.

PPREAT aims to:

-- Aggregate demand for renewable energy among public power
utilities;

-- Move renewable energy into mainstream power planning processes;

-- Identify opportunities for public power joint-ownership of
renewable energy projects;

-- Leverage federal and state renewable energy project development
technical assistance;

-- Hedge against future volatile electricity prices;

-- Create a common public power branding strategy around renewable
energy resources; and

-- Develop a replicable model for joint-ownership of renewable
energy projects.

While PRPEAT's initial collaborators come from California, PPREAT
participants ultimately hope to work with public power agencies from
across the nation.

Information on PPREAT and its activities will be available at
www.resource-solutions.org. CRS will soon issue a Request For
Proposals for soliciting partners in the renewable energy industry to
collaborate with PPREAT in response to the CEC PIER Renewable Energy
Program Area Grant RFP.
