Jeff - Page me  - 888 916-7186, call me - cell phone 973 714-4630, home phone

east.  Hope your trip went better.  Don't hesitate to reach out for me

Greetings:

Great to see you last week.  Hope you got out of there in a reasonable amount 
of time.  I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes between now and 
close-of-business Wednesday.  Very confidential matter--would like to tap 
your insights, get your feedback, and seek a bit of wisdom.  That work in 
your schedule?

Best,
Jeff
