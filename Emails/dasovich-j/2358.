Dear Aunty Nancy, 

It was nice to hear your voice yesterday.? My  mom and dad bought me a 
special 
hammock for  me to take my morning sunbaths.? I can look out of the window 
and  
watch the quail and squirrels.? Mom  thought you would like to see some 
photos 
of me. 

She also told me to tell you that she is going to  look into that "stuff" you 
told her  about. 

Bye for now......Love, Sammy? (meow) <<SAAMMY2.ZIP>>
