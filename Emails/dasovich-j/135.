Hi Everyone,

For those of you who are in the Tuesday night E202B course (section 2) in
the Spring semester, I would like to explain why the schedule had to be
modified in the way it was.

At the last minute just before the schedule came out, the original
instructor called to tell us that he would be unable to teach that section.
 Brett Trueman, the Accounting Group Chair, worked very hard and very
quickly to find a replacement.  Professor Sunil Udpa agreed to teach the
course but needed to adjust the class meeting dates due to prior commitments.

I apologize that the schedule for this course is less than ideal - however,
the tradeoff was quality of instruction versus convenience of class
meetings.  Brett and I  chose quality.   At this point, we are unable to
make any changes to the schedule.

Once again, I apologize for the less than ideal class schedule.

Regards,

Diane
