I have arranged for the phone bridge for the meeting referenced.  

We only have 2 lines for the call.

Both the Portland and San Francisco office should dial: 804/225-4063 to join 
the call.

In Portland we have reserved the Cascade conference room to take the call.

The meeting begins at 6:00am Pacific Time.

Attached is the Panel list.

I guess we would like the phone bridge for this.  Please find out how much it 
costs per line.
