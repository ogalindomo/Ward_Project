Nancy:  Yesterday we made a very slight change in language used (1st page, 
2nd bulletpoint).  I have attached the document reflecting this change.  
Given feedback from Jim on Friday, and Leslie today, the document is ready 
for use.  

Let me know if there are questions. 

Thanks, Jennifer

Jennifer, I just want to verify that this last version I have is the most 
recent and we can use it to 'shop around'.

Thanks,
Nancy

Per Linda's request, attached are the talking points on natural gas in CA.   
Note that we will continue updating these points are new data becomes

Have a nice weekend.
