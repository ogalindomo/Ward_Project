I really appreciated your participation today...very substantive and
constructive.  I particularly liked the idea of a migration "trigger",
which I included in the outline.  I personally think that the big ticket
items are rate level, rate freeze end and TRA allocation.  I wish we
could start facing that dance.  I'd play with (a) 25% immediate increase
in commodity price (explicit, rather than residual); (b) rate freeze end
on October 2, 2000 (c) pre EOF TRA undercollections to utilities,
everything after is allocated forward to procurement customers.
Thoughts?
