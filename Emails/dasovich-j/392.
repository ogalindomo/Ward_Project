Dear fellow Berkeley students,

Have a great business idea? Tired of fighting the crowds for a ten second slot
to sell your idea to a VC or an angel investor? Now you can literally obtain
seed financing in between classes. Starting March 1st, ITU is launching a
revolutionary Peer-to-Peer Venture Capital Program to provide unprecedented
support for entrepreneur-minded students.

Now you can present your business idea in a low stress environment to me, a
fellow student here at U.C. Berkeley. I am ITU's Berkeley Campus Partner and a
MBA student at the Haas School of Business. ITU will provide significant seed
funding as well as valuable operational support to promising entrepreneurs.

With its extensive network of partners, ITU will compress the time it takes 
for
an idea to transform into an operating business, assist with recruiting top
talent, implement technical development, establish strategic partnerships, and
handle legal and accounting requirements. As the portfolio company grows, ITU
will also help obtain additional rounds of financing.

If you are a highly motivated entrepreneur ready to leverage ITU's tremendous
resources to launch your own business, please email your executive summary and
business plan to kai@itu.com. For further information, please contact me or
visit www.itu.com.

Sincerely,

Kai Xu
Campus Partner - U.C. Berkeley, ITU
