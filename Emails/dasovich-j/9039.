OK, it's settled.  We will NOT turn in the case this Monday.  Good call, 
Dylan.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

We are not scheduled to turn this in and I don't think it will help at all 
with grading.  I have looked at the case but frankly I have to work both 
days this weekend and probably will not have a lot of time to 
contribute.  But if the group decides we want to pursue this I will help 
all I can.
