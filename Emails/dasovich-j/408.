Bob and Dick - as you requested, I am attaching a draft chronology letter for 
your use. Please understand that this has not been blessed by our Law Dept as 
it is only intended to provide guidelines for you. 
If you require a formal version endorsed by Enron you need to let me know and 
I'll run it by our attorney. Call me if you have any questions.
