Urging  you to  vote "no" on Proposition 36.  Funded by three out-of-state
billionaires, this misguided  initiative essentially decriminalizes heroin,
PCP, crack cocaine and other hard  drugs while seriously undermining
California's  highly successful  drug courts.   Opposed by every major
California newspaper, including LA  Times, Sac Bee, SF Chronicle, SJ
Mercury and San Diego Union.  Also opposed by CA AG Bill Lockyer, actor
Martin  Sheen, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, California Republican  Party,
Betty Ford  Center, Phoenix House,  California District Attorneys
Association, California State Sheriffs Association and over 300 other law
enforcement, public  safety  and  drug treatment  organizations.  (Please
