Here are some notes I have written up on discounting, present value, and
infinite series.  I hope these are helpful.  There seemed to be great
concern about this subject, some of which will hopefully be alleviated by
the attached notes.  It is in MS word format.  If this is a problem, let
me know.  You are always welcome to ask for individual help. I will be
sending out notes throughout the week on some of the more difficult
subjects we have covered.
