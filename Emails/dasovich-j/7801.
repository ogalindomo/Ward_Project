Please plan to attend the second meeting of the California Markets Focus 
Group on Monday, December 18, 2001 EB 2868.  A separate memo containing the 
dial in information will be sent on Monday morning.  

Attached you will find the agenda for the meeting today,  a list of those 
attending the meeting today, and a summary of the discussion on each agenda 
item.  I will begin preparing a list of items which require action, which 
require monitoring for changes, and determine how  best to measure the impact 
of these items.   

Thanks to all of those who were able to attend the meeting today or sent a 
representative.  Please be prepared to present updates (including edits) on 
the items included in the attachments.  

Thanks,
Wanda Curry
