Further to this morning 's note,  this  most recent  version  is more 
complete  and
I  would   greatly appreciate your   comments/changes/thoughts  on  it  as 
soon  as  possible 
 as to whether  it is useful or not   to your  constituents.  and if so  we  
will  embrace the changes you suggest and 
if the document  does  the job as we hope it will,  we  will complete  the 
graphics , proofing  work  and  go to print 5000 copies  soonest.



  Thx  and regards 

Margaret
