As you  know, ALJ Biren has established May 5 as the date that testimony is 
due in  support of all settlements filed on April 3 and April 17.? While she 
may  offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the 
process  of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive 
Settlement  Agreement.? 
?
We  have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting 
the  testimony (as identified below).? The testimony will be based on a  "hub 
and spoke" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics  of 
unbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling  
process will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements  
SoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why 
the  settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state 
of  California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.? In  addition, I 
would like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony  prepared 
and circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement  agreement 
have an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the  drafts.? I 
suggest we adhere to the following schedule:
?
April  25? Draft Outlines of Testimony? (Optional)
April 28? 1st Draft Testimony
May 2??? 2nd Draft  Testimony
May  5??? File Testimony  w/Commission?????? 
?
I  think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so 
that  everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.? The schedule is  
compressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been  
given.?? The testimony assignments are identified  below.? There has been one 
change from what we had agreed to  previously.? SoCalGas will sponsor a 
witness on the "Concepts of  Unbundling".? I would also like to suggest that 
we file the testimony  a one comprehensive document.?? I have suggested a 
chapter-style  format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.? Let me 
know what you  think.
