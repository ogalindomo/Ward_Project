Dear Jeff
I am Organizing a Panel at the IEEE Summer Meeting in Vancouver July 15-19
on the California electricity crisis: cause, remedies and prevention. The
idea is to have different perspectives e.g. operations, market power, demand
side response, supply, regulatory etc. I would like to invite you to take
part in this panel. As someone that was intimately involved in the
restructuring you could provide an invaluable regulatory and political
perspective on how did we get into this and how can we get out. At this
point I have commitments from Fluckiger of the CAISO, Ed Kahn, Ward Uggerud
CEO of Otter Tail Power Company, Gary Ackermann, Executive Director-Western
Power Trading Forum and I am waiting for a commitment from Vikram Budraja.

Regard, Shmuel Oren
