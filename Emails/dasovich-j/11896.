Hi Jeff,
?
Question for the experts!!
?
With all the rhetoric flying around, it's hard to separate out  reality. Do 
you think PG&E would not have declared bankruptcy if the retail  side of the 
electric power business had been deregulated when the wholesale side  was? 
And if this HAD happened, would it have had an effect on our home utility  
bills? Thanks.
