Rob,

I agree.  One important objective--to raise the School's visibility--is 
better accomplished by doing this
event solo.  Another unit is not needed and could easily detract from GSPP.  
I will raise the issue with
the dean but I would be very surprised if he was interested in bringing in a 
partner at this point.
