		 Subject: What is the Reaction from SDG&E, SCE, and PG&E to FERC Decision?

Can you guys look into (quietly) the perspectives of the three utilities on 
the FERC decision?  It would be interesting to know especially about the 
question of refunds?

Other parties perspectives would also be helpful.

Jim
