Hi Dung,

I haven't seen anything with performance or reliability metrics.  I'll send 
this around to the other people in our group to see if they've seen anything.

Sue,

We're looking at evaluating our network metrics vs. other carriers.  Most of 
the information I have found 
centers on reach (i.e. miles of fiber, presence, etc.) as opposed ot 
performance or reliability.  Has anything 
crossed your attention in the Regulatory space that looks at this type of 
issue?
