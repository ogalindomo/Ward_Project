All,

Following is a list of the top 10 priorities for the EBS Government Affairs 
organization.  Please note, the priorities are not in order of importance. 
Please review the list and feel free to recommend changes, i.e., additions or 
deletions. 

Further, we have been asked to come up with a "Top 5 Wish List" for the 
Government Affairs organization at large. Any suggestions for the wish list 
would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.  

Best regards,

Donald and Scott
