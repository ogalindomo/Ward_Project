Dear Evening MBA Students,

Beginning Tuesday, 9/26, Multex will be available off-campus. Multex
provides industry and company reports from a variety of analysts. I think
you will like this database. It is available from Long Library's website
(http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BUSI) under Electronic Resources towards the
top right of the page.
