FYI.  As soon as we see the Data Request, we will contact the appropriate 
people in legal to start working out our responses.

Subject: Another Data Request

I just received a call from John Kroeger of the FERC Ofice of Market 
Oversight and Enforcement.  They are in the process of a non-public 
investigation of gas prices at the California border and are issuing a 4 
question data request to ENA, EESI and EEMC (jointly) today.  I will forward 
the data request by e-mail as soon as I receive it from FERC, but wanted to 
give you a heads up.
