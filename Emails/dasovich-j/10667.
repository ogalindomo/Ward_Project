? According to a source close to Rosenfield, there is a strong possibility 
that Davis will announce some form of "utility bail out" in his five minute 
television address to the state of California tomorrow night at 6:05pm.  At 
this time we have no information as to what type of bail out this may be 
(transmission bill, etc.)  We are currently trying to get more information 
and will forward it when received.
