		 Subject: Meeting with Da Mayor

Dave/Sandi:  FYI.  In Joseph's absence, his fill-in asked that I take a call 
yesterday from the Mayor's office.  They called to confirm the meeting set up 
for Dave, Mike Day and Bev Hanson on Nov. 29th at 4 PM to discuss the serious 
electricity shortage in SF.

Best,
Jeff
