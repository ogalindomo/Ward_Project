To All,

There will be a shutdown of electricity panels controlling the data 
connections in the Student Services Bldg on Friday, April 13th at 5AM - 7AM.? 

The shutdown is due to installation of a new circuit breaker in the Student 
Services Building.? Other equipment outside of computers and fax machines 
will still have power and not be affected.

Thank you for you understanding and cooperation.
