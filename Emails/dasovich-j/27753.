Jeff --

I'm writing the direct access story that you and I spoke about, but now
I'm hearing that Enron is cutting off direct access for residential
customers in California.

I know you're out of town today. Wonder if you can give me a quick
call to explain it -- was it not making enough money? - is it related
to the PUC putting d.a. on the June 14 agenda? -- and how many
customers you have in California.

Cheers,

Kate
