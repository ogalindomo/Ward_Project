Scott,

Joe Main left a voice mail asking for the update on CA.  He sounds anxious to 
get an update because of the high cost of Index vs. utility rate.

Jeff,

Tricon has requested information regarding Socal Ed cost of gas vs. market 
Index.  Tricon is trying to decide if they should return to the utility.  
What is the mechanism Socal Edison uses to true up cost of gas?  When/how 
often does this happen???

Thanks,

Michelle
