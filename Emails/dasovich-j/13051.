We are attempting to follow up on the Bowen comment about the CPUC.  In
contrast to Bowen's statememnt, 3PUC commissioners indicated today during
discussions on related matters at their normal business meeting that they
supported direct access and one commissioner--Brown--indicated that he hoped
the Bowen bill passed.  We are unaware of any special meeting to address
direct access next week.  We will provide more information as we obtain it.

Subject: SBX 27 - PASSAGE


SBX2 27 (Bowen) passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on a
7-5 party-line vote.  In her closing, Senator Bowen said that if the
supporters of direct access do not want to help her with her bill she
would just as soon let if fail.  She also stated that the CPUC was going
to terminate direct access next week.  There was one additional
amendment taken which specifies that DWR must inform customers within 30
days of an inquiry what the projected exit fee will be.
