We in Gov. Affairs produce a lengthy report each week on all filings made at 
FERC for the week.  I felt that this report could be very useful to you if it 
could be pared down and made more user friendly, thus saving precious time.  
My initial impression is that a topic or key word index could narrow the 
scope of the items you need to look at in the report, in order to come up to 
date on topics of interest to you.  I have therefore pared down the report to 
include only electric matters in the West, and have indexed the items for 
your convenience and speed of use.  Any input on this is welcome.  If you 
wish to add or delete names from the distribution, please also advise.  So as 
to lose as little info as possible, I am starting the report retrospectively 
to the week ending April 27, and will try to catch up as quickly as 
possible.  Should you have any question on any of the items, or require 
additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.  Thanks.  Ray
