Hi Jeff,

Seems like a million years since we last spoke.  Hope all is well with
you.  Did you finish up the semester okay??

We are doing fine - Vivie came a little early, but we were expecting
that.  I am very glad for the time off work and school - it's much needed
with the little one.

Here are some one week old pics - she is already a star.
