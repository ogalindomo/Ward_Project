The first of our weekly conference calls will be Monday, November 6 at 11:15 
CDT.  The call in number is 888-311-9051 and the passcode is 60396.

The topic will be cable open access.  I am attaching a slide presentation 
that outlines three potential strategies.  Please note that this is strictly 
an internal document and that our ultimate strategy continues to be very much 
a work in progress.
