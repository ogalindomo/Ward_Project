 I have attached AS7, the answers to the final problem set.  Note that as
promised, the applications to business decisions are quite direct, and you
have a number of  opportunities on PS7 to demonstrate your understanding of
economics without using mathematics.
 This answer set will be discussed in section over the next 2 weeks.   Some
of the material on Vertical Integration will be covered in class next
week.  I thought it was worthwhile making sure you had all of this material
in advance so you would have ample time to think about it before the final 
exam.
