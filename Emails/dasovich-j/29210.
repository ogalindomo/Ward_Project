The Enron-sponsored briefing on energy policy will be from 5-6:30 pm in the 
Booth Room on the 5th floor of the Marriott Marquis on Friday, August 3.  Our 
presentation will be done by Jeff Dasovich.  Grover Norquist and Americans 
for Tax Reform will be carrying out all logistics.  

There should be time for the presentation, questions, and discussion.

Best,

Pat
