  CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT MATERIAL
  PER CPUC RULE 51

GAS ACCORD II RULE 51 PARTIES:

Attached below is the latest version of the evolving Gas Accord II Issues
list.  Since our October 25-26 Workshop, Southern Energy has expanded on its
issues.

We encourage each party to review this Issues List and provide an update
reflecting your issues and initial positions, as appropriate.  We are
actively using this list as we prepare for workshops and as we put together
the first complete settlement proposal.  We request that you provide any
revised or new input by November 15.

Also, please don't forget our next workshop, next week, on November 7 and 8.

Please return your comments and revisions to the Issues List by e-mail to
us, and also please copy Geoff Bellenger at gjb2@pge.com

Thank you for your continued participation in the Gas Accord II process.
