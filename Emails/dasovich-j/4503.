Jeff asked that I give you a heads up.  New Power is talking with legislators 
in CA about legislation to make retail electric sales more competitive.  We 
are hoping to move legislation early next year and expect to fight to kill 
bad bills.  Feel free to call if you have any questions as to what we are up 
to.
