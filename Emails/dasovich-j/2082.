Please review and update your sections of the regulatory report by close of 
business today, if possible.  If you do not have an update, let me know that 
as well.

		 Subject: Monthly Update to ENA

Thane -

As we discussed, can you please contact the appropriate people to update this 
Worksheet on EGA key activities for ENA.   Typically I have based this report 
on the IRTF submitted by the different offices (please see last report 
attached).  

My goal is to have a new report to Tammy Shepard (Dave Delainey's person) by 
the 5th of each month.  It would be great if we could go over your final 
draft on the 4th before sending it in to ENA.

Please call me with any questions.

Cheers,

Jim
