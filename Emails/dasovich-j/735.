Attached is an internal analyses put together by Roger Yang and myself 
reflecting the implicit energy charge as a result of Duque's bill cap. The 
energy charge varies as new delivery rates are implemented throughout 2000 
and 2001. 

The total number of residential customers in the SDG&E territory is 
approximately 1.1 Million. According to Duque's Decision only 70% will be 
protected by the cap.
