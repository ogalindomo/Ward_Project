We did want to get the road done - I'm a little unsure by what you mean about 
the wood.? Is there someone we could hire to do that?

I'm assuming, since I haven't heard back, that we're going to take a pass 
this time on the Dome road, and perhaps have Jeff Green do it another time? 
If I'm incorrect, we'll need to get things squared away, like today.

Let me know,
