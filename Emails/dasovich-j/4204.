Yes, definitely.  We need to get a handle on compliance issues, generally, 
including tax.

		 Subject: tax issues

Sue--a suggestion for discussion at our next weekly call.  As one of our 
Illinios IXC certification reporting requirements, EBS must file an 
application/registration with the Illinois Dept of Revenue and presumably 
will need to pay taxes to the the State of Illinois.  Our lawyer passed on 
the form to be completed, and Tracy had sent it to the tax department in 
Portland.  There seems to be ongoing confusion as to who should actually file 
this document (I would argue that the EBS tax department is the group that 
needs to do so, as well as establish an ongoing relationship with the folks 
at the Dept of Revenue) and who administratively needs to set up a system to 
handle any interaction with the Revenue dept. 

Since our IXC certifcations have only started to take place in 2000 this 
issue may not have hit the tax department before,  but I've got to believe 
that just about every state in the union is going to want to tax us on 
something, so I think we need to explore the issue further.  Could you please 
add to our agenda for next week?
