Jeff,

Great to see you and Prentice on T-day.  The stuffing was delicious!  And
congratulations on giving up smoking.

It's time to pick names for gifts.  My thought is that Prentice is enough a
part of this family that we add her name to the group.  Plan B is that we do
what we did last year:  Mom and I just get something for her and she doesn't
have to worry about getting something for whoever's name she "picks". Let me
know.
