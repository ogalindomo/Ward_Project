not comment

 The capacity, from the San Juan Basin to California, was open for bids unt=

Feb. 12, and
El Paso Merchant Energy held a right of first refusal at six receipt points=

until May 31. El Paso

 The capacity has been the source of controversy in the wake of California=

capacity.
The California Public Utilities Commission alleged in a FERC complaint that=

the agreement
between the companies was "rigged" (GD 1/11).

 Howald said that giving up that capacity and allowing the "market to decid=

would help El Paso on two fronts.
 "It probably makes sense considering the pressure they=01,ve been under fr=

regulators,"
Howald said. And "their pipeline operations could essentially garner some=

higher profitability
if they are able to increase the value of that capacity in an open season."=
