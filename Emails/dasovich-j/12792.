Jeff---

*  I just want you to know that I am not on the "Golden Bear" project - today 
was the first that I had heard that title - I know about Marty's group, but I 
didn't know the name.

*  Also, I am keeping all of the info from the Monday calls confidential.  I 
am just supposed to keep tabs on CA in case people around me ask (EES 
Regional Commodity - originators, management, etc.)

*  who knows!!

*  thank you for keeping me in the loop
