Congratulations.  Question: If you delivered on Friday then what is your 
excuse
for missing Thursday class?  Actually, I'm surprised it took so long.  Glad to
hear you are well and back home.

Our group includes:  Anil, Ted Chin, you, Jeff Dasovich, and me.

Will be starting the first assignment tonight.

Hi guys -
Well, my little bundle of joy arrived in the world on Friday am.  Her name is
Zo% Nicole and she is very sweet.  I am finally home from the hospital (I had 
to
have an emergency c-section so they kept me longer than expected).

I was wondering if you formed a group for FIA class?  I just e-mailed the
instructor that I would miss class this week and asked to be excused from the
first assignment.  I would like to stay on track after that, starting with 
Case
Write-Up #2. What is your plan for this class and these case write-ups?
