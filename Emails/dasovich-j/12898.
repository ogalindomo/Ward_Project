Attached, please find ABX2 42 (Kelley) which is Assemblyman Dave
Kelley's direct access bill, formerly ABX1 21.  The new language was
drafted by the Direct Access Coalition.  Assemblyman Kelley is going to
have a stakeholder meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss proposed
changes, particularly with respect to cogeneration.
