Attached is the revised Core/Non-Core Analysis per our discussion.  We have 
updated to include the new CPUC rate schedules for PGE and SCE and a toggle 
switch 20- year bond scenario to cover the past utility debt that is the 
burden of Non-Core.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
