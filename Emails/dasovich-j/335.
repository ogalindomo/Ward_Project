Hi (E202b-2 Managerial Accounting students)

Here are the tasks for the Tuesday class:

There is no assignment to be turned in. You should:

a) Go over the Plastim example (Lecture 3) on pages 137-150 of the text.
We briefly covered it in class on Saturday

b) Read pages 8-34 of Handout 4. We will discuss this in class on
Tuesday.

c) We are NOT doing the Ethical Drug case. You don't have to prepare for
it.

Cheers,

S Udpa
