Environmental regulations and policies have and will continue to play a 
significant role in the current California "energy crisis" situation.  It is 
a high priority of the Enron Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) 
organization to ensure that environmental issues are given serious 
consideration as part of Enron's efforts to capitalize on opportunities and 
manage risks related to the California crisis.

To that end, we have asked Mary Schoen, Manager, Environmental Strategies, to 
serve as the EHS organization's key contact for commercial, government 
affairs, EHS and public affairs personnel on environmental issues related to 
the California crisis situation.   As the primary interface with these 
groups, Mary will coordinate the numerous resources of the entire EHS 
department in support of Enron's activities, including:

Providing timely intelligence and analysis about environmental policy 
developments that affect Enron markets;
Reviewing legislation/regulation, coordinating environmental policy advocacy 
strategies and providing input into overall Enron advocacy efforts;
Providing assistance on environmental permitting, due diligence, and other 
technical services.
