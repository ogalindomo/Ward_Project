The proceeding that EGA is currently participating in will hopefully result 
in a retail adder that will be equivalent to the actual retail costs of the 
utility (which will be unbundled from the distribution rates).  Once this 
occurs, SCE will not be able to avoid the adder, even for industrial 
customers.  I think the folks at the utility are over-promising on something 
they won't be able to deliver once the CPUC issues its order in the retail 
adder proceeding.
