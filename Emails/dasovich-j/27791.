Ginger - Please forward this question to Rick's group:

We're in the process of converting the Project Tracking/RCR database from 
Lotus Notes to a web-based application.  One of the questions the team has 
asked is whether anyone replicates the database to work offline, and then 
replicate back to the network.  If you do this, please let me know as soon as 
possible.  Thanks!
