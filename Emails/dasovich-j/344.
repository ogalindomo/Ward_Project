In order to facilitate (and hopefully, simplify)  the updating and revising 
of the next Internal Resource Table
(for activities during February 16 - 29) I have attached an Excel worksheet 
for your newest
entries and/or revisions.  

PLEASE NOTE:  there are TWO (2) tab sheets:  one is labelled "Feb. 16 - 29" 
(for your input); and the other is
labelled "Feb. 1 - 15" (for reference, as it reflects your previous 
submissions).

Please try to complete and return to me by Monday, February 14th! (and don't 
forget your priority "rankings"!)

I hope that this helps simplify this process, so please do not hesitate to 
contact me with any questions.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Joseph
