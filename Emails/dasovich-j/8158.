David Connelly, an attorney from Bruder Gentile (Cal PX attorney, I suppose) 
just left me a voice mail message letting us know that the Cal PX has filed 
an emergency motion and petition for stay of FERC's December 15 order with 
the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.  He did not provide any more 
details but said the pleading should be posted on the Cal PX's website by the 
end of the day today.
