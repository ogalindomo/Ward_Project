Hey Everybody-

I will be leaving Tues., May 22 at noon to fly to Arizona for my sister's high
school graduation.  (sniff, sniff  I am so proud.)  I will be out the rest of 
the week
and returning to work Tues., May 29, after the Monday Holiday.  Jennifer Lind 
will
be holding down my side of the fort while I am out.  Please feel free to 
contact her 
if you need anything.  She is at 415-782-7818.

Even though I will be swimming and lounging around the pool soaking up the 
beautiful 
Arizona sun please do not hesitate to page me if you have any emergencies 
that require
my immediate assistance.

Cheers,
April Hrach
