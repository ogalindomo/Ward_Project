Coming into the stretch it's neck and neck between Cameron and Brady--only
one point apart.  And it's only 25 points between third and tenth.
Congratulations Pat for a great week; those were nice picks on the Bears and
Cowboys.  You're now the leading money winner for the year so far.  And the
Sheas, in the money for the fifth time--a record so far--came in second.
Third place for  the week goes to Cindy, who went from ninth to sixth place.
Dave, the only one of the four winners who put points on  the  49ers, came
in fourth but it looks like he learned from his mistake last week when he
put seven on Dallas instead of Washington this week.
