Subject:  Rule 22 Revision



Attached for your information is a draft Petition for Modification of the
Direct Access Tariff decision to modify Rule 22.? The proposed changes
attempt to provide more detail in the direct access tariff regarding what
should  occur if an Energy Service Provider loses its Scheduling
Coordinator.

Jennifer Tsao, the Edison attorney who has drafted this on behalf of all
three utilities, has said that the Rule 22 working group has already agreed
on  the proposed revised language to Rule 22.? She has asked that any
comments  on the draft Petition be provided to her by Wednesday, November
22.? She  can be reached at Jennifer.Tsao@sce.com
