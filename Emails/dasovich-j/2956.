Hello Everyone,
Attached is a list of the group lists I have received from you. Please
check, and if there is a change, please let me know.  Also some of them
might have vacancies.

Also, your midterms are in the Evening MBA office. You can collect them
from there. Pf. Berk has asked me to let you to know that his policy is to
regrade your entire exam should you request the regrade of any particular
question.
