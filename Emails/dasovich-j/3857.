Dear residents of northern California,
?
I'll be playing 4 dates in northern California in December as  the opening 
act for Dan Bern.? He's an unbelievably imaginitive and highly  entertaining 
songwriter, with a heavy streak of early Dylan.? He is also  very popular, so

attending.? Here are the details:
