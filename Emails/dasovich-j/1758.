Since we know you are now capable of driving a Metro bus, it is in your power 
to improve the quality of service to every bus riding man, woman, and child 
in Houston. Ditch the Excusion and drive a bus.

Cool!  Maybe I can play Black Sabbath on my 260 watt stereo for you guys on 
our way to work.  See if you get that kind of service on METRO.

In compliance with the new Houston Clean Air standards Mr. Fawcett has agreed 
to use his new vehicle for carpooling (a generous gesture as we know he would 
much rather just ride the Metro bus to work).
