Hi, all:

We are planning another series of Open Houses for prospective students in
December and early next year, and we are hoping to broaden the geographic
area in which we host these events.  We are currently thinking of having
Open Houses in the Sacramento area, the North Bay, and the Peninsula.  Does
anyone have suggestions for appropriate venues?  The requirements are
pretty simple - the space would need to seat about 200 people and have very
basic equipment (i.e. a microphone).  In the past, we have held Open Houses
at hotels, since they are easily located and able to provide light
refreshments.  Any ideas?  Thanks!

Julie
