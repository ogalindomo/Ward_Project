Subject: Peace Letter & FERC Transcripts

I've been asked for a copy of the transcript from the FERC hearing in S.D.  
Any chance of getting that?  And do you folks have a copy of the Peace letter 
(treatise) sent to FERC last week?  If so, could you fax it to 415.782.7854?  
Many thanks.  

Best,
Jeff
