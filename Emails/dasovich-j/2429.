I think it would be a good idea if you and Prentice used our neighbor's guest 
house.? It is a lovely space and you could have compete quiet and privacy 
whenever you wanted it and not have to go back and forth any more than 
absolutely necessary.? ok??

Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.? It was fun. 
And don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend 
since I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.? Likely means that I'll be 
studying in Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be 
present for the evenings.? H0pe that works. 

Kisses, 
Jeff 

PS I'm trying, lord knows I'm trying, to stay out of it, but it's going to 
start raining up at the Dome very, very soon.......
