Subject: ISO Requirements for Generating Unit Direct Telemetry


> Independent Energy Producers Association (IEP) Representatives:
>
> The attached letter requests your assistance in providing information to
IEP
> members regarding the ISO's recently-adopted requirements for direct
> telemetry from Generating Units that are providing -- or intend to provide
> -- Ancillary Services (other than Regulation) to the ISO.  Those
> requirements provide that such Generating Units utilize the Data
Processing
> Gateway (DPG) technology for direct telemetry effective as of June 1,
2001.
> We are particularly interested in ensuring that owners of Generating Units
> that may currently be operating under the terms of existing power purchase
> agreements be aware of the ISO requirements in advance of termination of
> those agreements so that they may plan and budget for the installation of
> the DPG technology in a timely manner.
>
> If time permits, we would also request that you inform IEP members of the
> ISO's December 7 stakeholder meeting to discuss DPG requirements, among
> other matters.
>
> Your assistance in disseminating the information contained in the attached
> letter is greatly appreciated.  A hard copy of the attached letter will be
> provided by FedEx.  Please feel free to contact me or one of the ISO
> employees identified in the attached letter if you have any questions.
> Thank you.
