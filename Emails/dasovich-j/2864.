		 Subject: Final FERC Filing



Attached is the final version of the FERC filing we are making today in  
response to the Edison/PG&E/TURN price caps and cost of service rate  filing.
?
My thanks to the many WPTF members (and especially to Phil Muller) for all  
your valuable comments and suggestions.? Far more people than usual  provided 
comments and, as a result, we ended up with a much better  product.? Thanks 
again!
