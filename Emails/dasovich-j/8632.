CPUC PRES. LORETTA LYNCH STATEMENT ON OUTAGES

California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Loretta Lynch today
issued the following statement:

     Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) began rotating outages of firm customers
starting at 11:54 a.m. in response to a request from the California 
Independent
System Operator (ISO). The ISO made the request late this morning when energy
supplies dipped below demand in Northern California.
     Public safety agencies such as police and fire departments, public
transportation agencies such as BART and Muni, hospitals larger than 100 beds,
and other agencies directly involved in public health and safety are exempt 
from
this plan and will suffer no interruption of power supply.
     Customers in PG&E's service area may experience outages of 60-90 minutes 
in
duration on a rotating basis through 9 p.m. this evening. This spreads the
inconvenience equitably but for as short a time as possible for all customers.
     Rotating outages begin only after all efforts have been made to secure
energy supplies and the utilities have curtailed all customers who participate
in interruptible programs where customers have voluntarily agreed to curtail
their energy usage during times of energy shortage in exchange for lower 
energy
rates.
     Every citizen is urged to conserve as much electric power as possible not
only today but in the future as Californians work together for a permanent,
equitable solution to the power supply problem.
