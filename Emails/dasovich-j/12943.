Becky and Christi:

Attached are revised talking points on natural gas in CA.  I have made 
revisions to reflect our discussion yesterday (e.g., no price caps, basis 
differential is not explained by transportation costs, etc.).

As discussed, I hope to get input from the gas fundamentals group tomorrow 
and finalize this document by Friday.

I welcome your feedback.
