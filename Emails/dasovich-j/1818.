The Homestretch
Trying to hit the oil button while it is hot, Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans 
to unveil an energy plan Friday.  Larry Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economics 
adviser, says it would focus on increasing domestic energy production, 
promoting conservation and coaxing more production out of oil-exporting 
nations.  A particular focus will be on streamlining the granting of  permits 
for construction of refineries, pipelines and power plants.  Mr. Bush says 
the Clinton-Gore administration has clogged the permitting process, helping 
produce shortfalls in supply of home-heating oil and electricity production.
