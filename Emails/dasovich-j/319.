To Sections E206-1 and E206-2:

This is just to confirm that, as discussed in class, there is the following
change in the syllabus and in the deadline for handing in the first
individual report:

1. The first individual report is now due on Wednesday, February 16 at 6pm
(for both sections). The previous deadline was February 9. This report is
the analysis of the case "EMI/CT Scanner (A) & (B)". We'll discuss the case
in class in the week of February 16.

2. On the week of February 9 (February 9 for Section 1 and February 10 for
section 2) we'll discuss in class the "Barco" case instead of the "EMI/CT
Scanner" case.

3. The lecture assignments for each class remain unchanged.
