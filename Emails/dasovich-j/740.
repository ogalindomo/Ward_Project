This is a reminder that PG&E is holding the first Gas OFO Forum on Tuesday,
August 29, 2000.  Attached is our proposed agenda for this meeting.  We will
have extra copies of both the July 31, 2000 OFO Report and the March 7, 2000
Balancing Report available at the meeting.

The Forum will be held in San Francisco at PG&E's Pacific Energy Center, 851
Howard Street (between 4th and 5th Streets).  There are a number of parking
lots in the area, including a very large lot also between 4th and 5th
Streets with entrances on 5th Street and Mission Street.  The meeting will
start at 9:30 a.m. and end around 4:00 p.m.  A continental breakfast will be
available at 9:00 a.m.  We will also provide lunch.

Please RSVP to Belinda Bates at bdb9@pge.com or 415-973-6626, if you have
not already done so.  We look forward to seeing you next week.
