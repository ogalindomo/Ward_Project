		 Subject: Delay in circulating DWR Dash

Given the status of Phase I of DWR possibly being extended to the end of 
April, we will not be circulating a DASH at this time for the five-year DWR 
swaption.  Will advise at a later date of any developments.

Thanks all for your help for now.

Regards,
Tracy
