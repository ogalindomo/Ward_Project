RE: LEGISLATIVE TRACKING REPORTS

As promised, attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports for
both the regular and special sessions missing from last week's legislative
report.  Please let me know if you need a copy of any of these bills.

Also, due to the legislative recess, and a little recess of my own, there
will be no weekly report this Friday.  Please call my office if you have any
questions and Karen Baker will assist you.
