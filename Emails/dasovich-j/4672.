The next time anyone goes to the dome, please go through Bodega Bay.? I left 
some things at our rental there and they have them for me.? It's a little 
gray house with a Vacation Rentals USA sign on the left side of the street 
just before you get into Bodega.? Lady's name is Betty.? It's a potato peeler 
(my favorite one) and an Ah-So.? I would be very appreciative!
