I have reviewed ABX 78, 73, 23 and 42.  No problems with 23, 42 and 73.  I am 
not sure what 78 is really getting to, it alleviates the need for a public 
utility to obtain a CPUC finding that an offer of competitive services whcih 
requires use of eminent domain would serve the public interest.  I have a 
feeling this gives the utilities an advantage over non-utility competitors, 
who do not have power of eminent domain.  At least requiring the CPUC to 
authorize its use seems to level the playing field a little.  But I may be 
missing something.
