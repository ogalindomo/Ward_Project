Ok guys I've taken a stab at #5.  I valued the company by taken the NPV of
future after tax net earnings (see attached speadsheet-right side of exhibit
1).  To get a value of $28/share I calculate Netscape would have to grow at
17.75%/year from 1995 to 2005.  Please scrutinize my strategy and give me
feedback.
