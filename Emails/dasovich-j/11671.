Scott,

Apologies on behalf of Jeff re:  not responding to you to date; I have been 
assured, however, 
that you will hear from him as soon as he can "get his head above water"!  I 
know that he has been extremely busy preparing for travel to and meetings in 
Houston next week, and we both appreciate your patience.

Jeff will respond to your inquiry as soon as possible. 

Thanks again for your understanding,

Joseph Alamo
