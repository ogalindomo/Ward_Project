Beginning with this Thursday, April 19th and all future meetings, it is 
necessary that we delay the above scheduled weekly conference call by 30 
minutes in order to avoid overlapping with another one.

My apologies for the late notice but please make the necessary changes to 
your calendar immediately.  All dial in numbers and passcodes remain the 
same, the time is the only thing we are changing.  Again, here is the 
information for verification:
