Here is what we use in our contracts.  Please recognize that using this index 
understates the value of energy to industrial clients as it does not consider

1)  Transmission & Distribution
2)  Higher costs for less than 25 MW blocks
3)  Higher costs as industrials use a different quantity each hour rather 
than a constant amount during peak and off peak periods
4)  ISO charges for retail load (there are 4 or 5 charge codes such as 
Ancillary Services, Grid Management Charges, etc.) that are assessed 
Scheduling Coordinators that serve retail load represents the value of 25 MW 
blocks
5)  Load forecasting risk
6)  Credit Risk

The sum of these would add at least 25% to the index price and I would not be 
at all surprised if the adder would be more like 50%.
