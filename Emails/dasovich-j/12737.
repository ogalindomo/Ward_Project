		 Subject: Gov't Affairs bringing in Deals

Ginger -- Can you please forward to our North America group.  Thanks.





Some originators today reiterated how valuable Gov't Affairs can be in 
bringing deals (citing Tom Chapman -- Alamac and Dan Allegretti -UI).  The 
new East power services desk (headed by Lloyd Will and Tom May) is taking off 
and very interested in muni, industrial on-site generation purchases, 
scheduling, etc.  Origination (EPMI and EES) are interested in structured 
deals -- all requirements, tolling, etc.  Thanks for keeping this in mind 
while out there in the trenches!

Christi N.
