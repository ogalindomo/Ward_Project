FYI.  Attached is the CAISO Market Surveillance Committee Report on Price
Spikes.  This was the basis of Frank Wolaks presentation to the CAISO Board
yesterday.  Also, the CAISO Board voted out most of the Comprehensive Market
Reform package, while deferring until October many issues surrounding the
procurement of Local Reliability Services (e.g. the 2-day ahead market).
Katie will be summarizing and distributing later today what was voted out,
what was deferred.
