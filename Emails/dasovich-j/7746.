I need a cite or official source for the fact that either 8,000 MW or 11,000 
MW of capacity has been postponed in the permit process in California for a 
list of think tank folks that I want to focus on the California power 
crisis.  I have the cite for the fact that peak demand between 1995-99 
increased 12% versus capacity that increased closer to 1%.

Maybe CERA has reported this (Margaret?).
