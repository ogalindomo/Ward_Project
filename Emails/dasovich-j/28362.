CNBC this morning said that Calpine had reached a deal for a 20-year contract 
and in return they will be paid $270 million owed -- this has boosted 
Calpine's stock. I also heard about a deal (still confidential) with PG&E, 
called an assumption agreement, at $53.70. I assume this latter deal involves 
QFs and is separate from the former deal.
