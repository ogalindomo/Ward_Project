Susan,

Well you have either had a week from hell so far or its just taking you time
to come up with some good bs.  Without being too forward I will be in town
next Friday and wanted to know if you would like to go to dinner or
something.  At least that will give us a chance to talk face to face.  If
your busy don't worry about it I thought I would just throw it out there.

I'll keep this one short and sweet since the last one was rather lengthy.
Hope this Thursday is a little better then last week.

Kyle
