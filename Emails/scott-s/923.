Tom Beach received the navidad virus in e-mail  yesterday, and it replicated 
itself and went out to many (maybe all) of the  people who had sent him 
e-mail that he had not yet opened (i.e., unopened mail  in his Outlook 
Express in-box).
?
Because the OII and peaking rate filings were  yesterday, you probably sent 
Tom e-mail that he didn't have a chance to look  at.? If you have a firewall 
system that rejects any e-mail with executable  files attached, you're safe.? 
If you don't, here is the URL with the virus  cure:

In Tom's system, I was able to ignore the error  message about the machine 
not being able to find "winsvrc.exe," open  his Internet browser, and 
download the virus repair file from this Web  site.? It's a relatively easy 
fix once that's done.
?
I'm terribly sorry about this.? Let me know  if I can be of further 
assistance.
