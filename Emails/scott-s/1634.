Things will work out.

I am going to Scott Chen's tomorrow with Mike and Kristi.  He mentioned that
we should all go out sometime.

I am showing George P. Bush around UT law school next year.  He is Jeb's
(Florida Governor) son.  Paul Doyle knows him from Rice.  He was just named
one of the 50 most eligible bachelors in People Magazine.  If things don't
work out with Ted... (or Doug for that matter).  I'm kidding, of course.  It
should be fun.

Anyway, let me know what you find out.

-Corey

Sorry for the short initial email.  He hasn't said anything to me yet.
We're going to dinner and Blanco's tomorrow night...so if he's ever going
to tell me I figure it'll be then.  I'm trying not to think about it too
much but Sunday was so great that in light of that the prospect of him
leaving makes me very sad.
