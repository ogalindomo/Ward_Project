   "President Obasanjo has, at several fora been accused of having this
   unexplainable contempt for sports... One of the greatest tragedies this
   year for close watchers of the intrigues of sports in Nigeria would be
   for the president, after a possible disgraceful outing in Sydney repeats
   his statement of the post All Africa Games fiasco. Remember it? He said,
   blame me, not my minister."
