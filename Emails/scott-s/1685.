Fellow Analysts and Associates,

The following is the agenda for the DePelchin Service Project on Saturday, 
July 15th.

We look forward to seeing you then, so we can paint the Children's Gym.  (If 
you think you're going to be messy, be sure to wear some old clothes!!)

The same schedule still applies.   Thank you so much for your participation 
and patience!!!    Also, if you know of any other people who may be 
interested we'd love to hear from them!   Or if you don't see your name below 
- please let us know!
