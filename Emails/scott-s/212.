I am resending this because many of you have noted to me that you never 
received it.? It appears we are still having difficulty transmitting from 
LA.?? I am asking Glen Sullivan, once he receives this, to re-forward it to 
you.? He is on a system that is working.

Subject:??????? e-mail Alert and Testimony Finalization 

As a result of the ILOVEYOU virus that was sent out yesterday, e-mail traffic 
from and to SoCalGas, SDG&E and the Sempra Companies was interfered with and 
was not received.? If there were substantive changes requested for Lad or 
Eric's testimony, then please let me know ASAP.? I believe we are now able to 
receive and send e-mail.

After reviewing ALJ Biren's order, we need to pre-mark our exhibits.? TURN 
and SCGC will be marking their testimony and exhibits as 100-999.? The 
Comprehensive Settlement parties will be marking their exhibits beginning 
from 1-99.? Here's my suggestion on how the exhibits should be marked:

Exhibit 1?? Comprehensive Settlement Document?? 
Exhibit 2?? Lad Lorenz Testimony 
Exhibit 3?? Eric Nelson Testimony 
Exhibit 4?? Mark Pocta Testimony 
Exhibit 5?? Tom Beach Testimony 
Exhibit 6?? Jeff Dasovich Testimony 
Exhibit 7?? Rick Counihan Testimony 
Exhibit 8?? John Burkholder Testimony 
Exhibit 9?? Paul Amirault Testimony 
Exhibit 10 Jeanne Zaiontz Testimony 
Exhibit 11? Paul McKelvey Testimony 

I hope I haven't left anyone out.? If we can agree on the exhibit 
designation, mark the testimony in the upper right hand section of the front 
page of the testimony.
