   "One golden rule is to accept the interpretation honestly put on
   the pledge by the party administering it. Another is to accept the
   interpretation of the weaker party, where there are two interpretations
   possible. Rejection of these two rules gives rise to strife and
   iniquity, which are rooted in untruthfulness."
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.


This week's theme: words from Gandhi's autobiography.
