I just wanted to tell the three of you that I had such a ball at Texadelphia
today... Susan, I am so happy for you and your Ted Noble stories were
wonderful! :o)

Jessica, I am VERY glad that it worked out that you could be in Houston this
weekend... everything was so relaxing and I enjoyed the time spent.... glad
we were also able to share the terrible Houston fashion scene... so sad...

I love you all very much and hope you have a wonderful week!

-Jen


PS  Susan here's the quote:

"I think we delight to praise what we enjoy because the praise not merely
expresses but completes the enjoyment; it is its appointed consummation.  It
is not out of compliment that lovers keep on telling one another how
beautiful they are; the delight is incomplete till it is expressed."  --
C.S. Lewis
