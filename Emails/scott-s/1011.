Okay everyone, here are the details on the party............

Party starts at 7:00, I figure we should get there around 8:00 to make our 
grand entrance.  Plan on coming by my place anytime say 6 - 6:30 ish and 
we'll head over around 7:45 or so.  I will be getting some party trays, but 
unfortunately, Uncle Enron won't pay for the alcohol.   So..........bring 
alcohol and a party attitude!

I live at Providence @ Uptown.  3323 McCue Rd #1743.  This is located behind 
the Best Buy at Richmond and 610 (also across from City Streets, not that I 
ever go there!)  You will have to dial up to my apt to get in the gate.  I 
think you hit #1743 and it dials me up.  (The directions are on the keypad).  
I live on the 4th floor, but you will need to park on the roof (5).  They are 
very particular about the parking!  There are 4 hallways off the parking 
garage at each corner.  Mine would be the SE corner, anyway the apt #'s will 
start with 1600......... you're in the right place just keep going (it's not 
that far).  There is a big plant outside my door (I know you guys are amazed 
I have living plant!)  If you have any questions my number is (713) 550-8698.

See you there!!!!!!!!!!
