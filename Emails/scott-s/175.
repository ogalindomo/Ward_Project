Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in 
the errata - Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions.? The first, Wheeler 
Ridge, was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and 
ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers.? 
SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as 
proposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition.? There 
was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went 
beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the 
settlement.?? As for the Pooling Revisions, Dynegy expressed reservations 
about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number 
of pools available per shipper.? Dynegy was not able to garner internal 
approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so 
Pooling revisions were taken off the table.? SoCalGas supports the pooling 
revisions and no other party expressed any concerns.? ALJ Biren asked us to 
file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to 
mail it out to the parties today, so our already compressed deadline for 
getting this out the door was even more compressed.? 

Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the 
outstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were 
circulated (to our dismay).? PG&E has now indicated they will file limited 
opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with 
regard to Wheeler Ridge.

Subject: RE: GIR 

Brian, 

I did not see a change on the Wheeler Ridge capacity issue that was put 
forth earlier.? Several parties supported the change including Calpine, SCE, 
WHP and WGS and no opposition was voiced.? It is my understanding that PG&E 
will not sign on to the Settlement even if this change is made but will 
agree not to oppose (this issue and many others).? Not only does the change 
itself make sense but there is a lot of value in not having another front to 
do battle on in the hearing process.? Is SoCalGas opposed to this change? 
And if so, why? 

Thanks 

Craig
