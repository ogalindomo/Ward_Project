Parties to the PG&E Gas OII Settlement:

On June 13th, PG&E held a workshop to discuss proposed tariffs to implement
the Comprehensive PG&E Gas OII Settlement Agreement.  At that meeting,
parties raised various issues concerning the draft tariffs we distributed on
May 25th.  Attached please find PG&E's proposed response to those issues,
other than metering issues which we will address next week.  In addition, we
have included changes to the non-metering draft tariffs from the version we
distributed on May 25th.

We encourage you to provide us with comments on these drafts by Friday, June
30, 2000.  We will host a half-day workshop on any unresolved issues on
Thursday, July 6, at 1:30 p.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San
Francisco.

We will provide a response to the metering issues on Wednesday, June 28th,
and will host a half-day tariff workshop on these issues on Friday, June 30,
starting at 10:00 a.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.

Thanks for your help in finalizing these tariffs for our July 17 compliance
filing.
