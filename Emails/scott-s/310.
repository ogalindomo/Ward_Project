Dear Judge Biren and parties:

SoCalGas and SDG&E are not filing any motions to strike prepared testimony
today.

SoCalGas and SDG&E do not plan to object to the receipt in evidence of any
of the prepared testimony served to date and would be willing to stipulate
to its receipt in evidence without having to have it attested to by the
witness on the record.

SoCalGas and SDG&E jointly anticipate cross-examination as described below,
although this amount could be modified due to possible overlap with other
parties' cross-examination.

Mr. Florio (TURN)- one hour
Ms. Yap (SCGC) - one hour
Mr. Weil (Aglet)  - half hour

Mr. Black (Southwest Gas) - quarter hour
Ms. Wright (Long Beach) - quarter hour

SoCalGas and SDG&E do not currently intend to cross-examine other witnesses.

Attorney for SoCalGas and SDG&E
