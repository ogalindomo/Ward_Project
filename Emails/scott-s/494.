Gas OII/OFO Settlement Parties:

Attached please find PG&E's OFO Report for The Second Quarter 2000.  This is
provided to you in accordance with the Operational Flow Order ("OFO")
Settlement Agreement between PG&E and many other parties, filed in the
CPUC's Gas Strategy OII 99-07-003, and approved by the CPUC by Decision
00-02-050.  Section C.1.f. of that Agreement requires PG&E to prepare a
Quarterly OFO Report concerning the number and causes of OFO events within
the prior three months.

We attempted to send this report earlier today, in two different versions of
WORD and Excel, to help make this document readable to all.  However, the
resulting message was too large to reach many of you.  This e-mail only
contains one copy of each document.  If you have any difficulty opening
these documents, please contact Geoff Bellenger at GJB2@PGE.com.

We are in the process of setting a date for the first OFO Forum and will
notify you shortly of those arrangements.

If you have any questions on this report, please call Rich Hall at (415)
972-5115.
