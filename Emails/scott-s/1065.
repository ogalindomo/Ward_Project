Tis the Season for a Christmas Tasters!!

Hopefully I have everyone's input who has emailed me - if not, send it to me
again.  Now I have a little list by my desk where I record these things.  Here
is what everyone has volunteered to bring:

Becca:  Rolls, Desert
Julianna:  veggie crossiant
Ashlea:  7 layer dip
Jen:  pumpkin flan (and something else, TBD)
Berry:  turkey/roasted chicken - kudos!!!!
Lisa:  green beans and cupcakes

The party is at 3035 Quenby (Jen's house) around 7:45.

Everyone else decide what you will bring and send me an email.  This is going 
to
be a blast and a great way to start the Christmas season!  Also, please bring 
a
gift (under $15) that is a decorative Christmas piece for our gift exchange.

Can't wait to see you guys!  Everyone get excited - Deborah is going to be 
back
in Houston!
