Susan,

I am plus/minus on the movie - just a thought.

You are glowing? I have the shakes  - being with you makes so happy. The
shear excitement I have when I get an e-mail from is embarrassing.

Sooz,

Regarding tonight:

I am in for happy hour and/or the gallery. I like to meet Susan. I plan on
do a quick run at lunch.

Could do a movie later.
