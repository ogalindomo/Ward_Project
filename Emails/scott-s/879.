Confidential -- For Settlement Purposes Subject to CPUC Rule 51
ALL:

A reminder that we are still hoping to have an initial Gas Accord II
Settlement Proposal to you by Wednesday, December 20, 2000, and the we have
canceled our proposed meeting scheduled for December 13th and 14th.
However, we also must focus on the current short-term gas and electric
market situation, as we are sure you are.  Our next meeting is still
scheduled for January 10 and 11, 2001, to present our proposal and to
receive feedback from you.

As to issues, attached are two items.  One is our current version of the
issues list, and the other is a position paper provided by the Indicated
Producers.

Again, thank you for your participation in the Gas Accord II Settlement
Process.  We look forward to providing you with our initial proposal and to
our subsequent settlement discussions.  Please feel free to call us if you
have questions or concerns.
