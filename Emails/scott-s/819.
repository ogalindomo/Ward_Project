Subject: Keystone Unit Regrout & Ovehaul

Marketing has approved the regrout and overhaul for one of the recip units.  
This is contingent upon a completion date.  Marketing was hoping for 
completion by the end of December.  However, discussions with Engineering 
indicate 7 - 8 weeks for the overhaul and regrout.  By copy of this letter I 
am requested Marketing to approve or disapprove the Keystone work even though 
it will take through January for completion.

Thanks,

Ron M.
