Subject:  Cover for Rebuttal


Luckily, Marcel had sent me the cover letter and cover for the direct
testimony electronically.  I have adapted both to the purposes of
rebuttal and guessed that the exhibit would be marked 102.  You need to
check it over and get Jacki to make any necessary corrections, plus
print it on Jones, Day letterhead.
