Attached for your review and comment are some additional draft data responses 
for ALJ Biren.? Please forward your comments to me as soon as possible.? ALJ 
Biren has asked that we try and finish our responses to her questions as 
expeditiously as possible.? There are two responses I would like to focus 
your attention on: first, regarding her request to provide alternative 
charts, is likely non-responsive.? Answering the question, however, assumes a 
variety of facts and circumstances that are extremely variable.? I would 
nonetheless appreciate your feedback.? The second question concerns the RLS 
tariff.? We have reached a compromise with some of our settlement parties who 
oppose the RLS tariff on the language.? Let me know if it is acceptable.? You 
can call me direct at 415 202-9986.
