Parties to the Gas OII PG&E Settlement:

Last week, the CPUC approved the Comprehensive PG&E Settlement Agreement,
resolving all issues concerning PG&E in the Gas Strategy Investigation.  The
next step is getting the tariffs approved.  A revised draft of proposed
tariffs is attached.  In addition, attached please find a list of issues
raised at the draft tariff workshop PG&E hosted on April 10, 2000 (as well
as a few issues that were provided more recently), along with PG&E's
proposed resolution of those issues.
