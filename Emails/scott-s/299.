Dear ALJ Biren:

Kern River Gas Transmission Company plans to offer two exhibits in the form
of the Direct and Rebuttal Testimony of Kirk T. Morgan, for which exhibit
numbers have not yet been established.

I initially estimate the following cross-examination time:

Richard Hall, PG&E         .5  hours

There may be additional witnesses, depending on information at the
prehearing
conference.  Please let me know if you have questions.

Mark C. Moench
