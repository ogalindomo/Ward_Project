How was the play?  I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run 
Jeopardy the other night and I almost called you but it came on at 11:30.  
Smart girl.  I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Darren.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you 
later.
