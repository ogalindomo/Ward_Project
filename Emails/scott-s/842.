With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.
