Miltonic (mil-TON-ik) adjective, also Miltonian

  1. Of or pertaining to the poet Milton or his writings.

  2. Resembling Milton's majestic style.

[After John Milton (1608-1674).]

   "Siphoning off the grandeur of his Miltonic inspiration and transfusing
   it with foggily redundant obscenities, Lord-Wolff denatures evil into
   sniggering adolescent angst."
   Sybil Steinberg, Forecasts: Fiction, Publishers Weekly, Dec 20, 1999.
