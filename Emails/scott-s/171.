Attached for your comment and review is a very rough draft of Lad Lorenz's 
testimony in the GIR/NGS proceeding.? Because of the time constraints we 
face, I am circulating this testimony for internal and external review 
simultaneously.? As a result, I would like to make the caveat to the external 
parties that the language contained herein is subject to change by SoCalGas 
and SDG&E management.? If such changes occur, you will be fully informed of 
the context and content of those changes.? Please forward your comments 
directly to Lad Lorenz and/or Steve Watson.? We expect to circulate another 
draft Monday COB.
