Hello girls!

I was talking with "on-the-ball" Ayres last night and we were discussing the
bridesmaid's luncheon.  I was thinking a good time would be Friday for a late
lunch (around 1:00).  That would be late enough for morning flights to arrive
and still give us enough time for the rehersal dinner.  But, I want to make 
sure
this fits with your schedules because we can always have it on Saturday.  On
Saturday I had planned for us to go get our nails done and hair (optional) but
we can flip flop the days if some of you will not be able to get off on 
Friday,
etc.

So, let me know what you think and what your schedule allows!

Hope all is well with you guys!!!!

Love you,
Lisa
