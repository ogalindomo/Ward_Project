This is a re-transmission of an e-mail I sent a few minutes ago.  I received
a message that a large number of the addressees did not receive a copy.  I
apologize if this is a duplicate message for you.

Dear Judge Biren and parties:

Attached is SoCalGas and SDG&E's proposed transcript corrections in
