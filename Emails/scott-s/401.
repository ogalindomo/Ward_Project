It has come to my attention that an incorrect transmittal letter was included 
with the
e-mail sent earlier this afternoon on behalf of El Paso Natural Gas Company 
with
El Paso's Opposition to Receipt of Exhibit 28 and Motion For Admission of
Alternative Exhibit 602.  The correct transmittal letter is attached to this 
e-mail.
We regret any inconvenience.  Very truly yours,  Edward W. O'Neill for El
Paso Natural Gas Company
