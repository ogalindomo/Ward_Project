Dear Judge Biren:

Pursuant to your instructions regarding procedures for serving testimony and
preparing exhibits, I submit the following information on behalf of Long
Beach.

a,  List of exhibits

    Long Beach intends to offer two exhibits:  Ex. 200, the prepared direct
testimony   of Elizabeth Wright, and Ex. 201, the prepared rebuttal testimony
of  Elizabeth Wright.

b.  estimate of direct and cross-examination time

    Long Beach estimates only a few minutes of direct examination.

    Regarding cross-examination, Long Beach's estimates are necessarily
preliminary and incomplete (apparently I did not receive all of the direct
testimony) in light of the recent filing of rebuttal testimony.  Current
estimates   are as follows:

    Ladd Lorenz, SoCalGas - 4 hr.
    Eric Nelson, SoCalGas - 2 hr.
    R. Thomas Beach, various parties - 2 hr.
    Paul Amirault, Wild Goose - 1/2 hour
    Jeffrey Dasovich, Enron - 1/2 hour
    John Burkholder, Western Hub Properties - 11/2 hour
    Florio/Weil/Yap, Turn, et al - 2 hours

There may be additional witnesses, depending on information at the prehearing
conference.

Patrick Power
