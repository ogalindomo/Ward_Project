     Please find below SCGC's cross-examination estimates, based upon the
prepared testimony that I have received to date:

     Lorenz         3.25
     Nelson         0.25
     Pocta          1.75
     Beach          1.25
     Dasovich  0.25
     Counihan  0.75
     Burkholder     0.5
     Amirault  0.5
     Zaiontz        0.5
     McKelvey  0.25
     McConn    0.25
     Weaver    0.25
     Wright         0.75
     Fawcett        0.25
     Hall      0.5
     Black          0.25
     Orndorff       0.25

There are several parties from which I received opening testimony but, to
date, no reply testimony.  If reply testimony filters in or other
unforeseen events occur, there may be a need to revise these estimates.
