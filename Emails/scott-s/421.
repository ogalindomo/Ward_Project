Parties in I.99-07-003: 

I am sending my ruling on admission of late-filed exhibits by email so that 
you know what can and cannot be cited to in your briefs.? I apologize that 
you have not received this sooner and that it is not "final."? I realize that 
it is very late in your brief-writing process.

I was unaware until just now that it had not gone out. 

Again, I am sorry for the delay and confusion. 

--Judge Biren
