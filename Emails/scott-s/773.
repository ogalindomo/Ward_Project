And we're coming to Houston!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Houston this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Santa Monica Civic Center then tried to find a 
turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Houston on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of North Houston. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue
