Hola Susana,

Well I lost my semi-final match due to sub par serving.  If I served like I
did against you last Monday I would have won!  I'm playing Ron Billings
tonight at 6 & maybe the good-serving Bill will show up.

Espero que el problema de seno (sinus) se haya mejorado y que te pase bien
el dia.

Un beso, G.
