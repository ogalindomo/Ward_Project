Sooz,

I called SW Bell and changed the number.  Apparently, I can't have that
number in my new place, but in order for a changed number message to run,
you can't have it either. So the new number on your second line is (713)
426-5773 and it will start on the 5th. Until then, my number will ring in
both places.  My new number is (713) 526-7855...

Hope this is okay with you.  I left the new second number tied in with the
4960 number with the same long distance service you have on that line etc.

Hope you are having a good morning!

:) D-
