Susan,

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Ted
