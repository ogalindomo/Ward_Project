Sorry I haven't responded Laura.? The 19th is bad for me because I won't be 
finished with finals, and it sounds like everyone can't make it then anyway.? 
My vote is for the? 22nd, 8:30pm, and Benji's.? 

I look forward to seeing everyone, especially since the last time I saw 
several of you was not a good time for me.? 
See you girls then, Ashley
