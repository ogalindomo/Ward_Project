Attached for your review and comment is a draft table identifying incoming 
interstate capacity at receipt points on SoCalGas' system and a system map 
identifying those locations, per the request of ALJ Biren.? We have confirmed 
wherever possible the incoming receipt point capacities with the pipelines 
and also tried to fairly characterize the take-away capacities and deliveries 
from those receipt points.? Please forward your comments to me as soon as 
possible so that we can coordinate the filing of the draft exhibit to the 
service list by July 16.
