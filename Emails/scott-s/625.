Susan,

I am afraid I have some bad news (well, happy in some ways but not so good
in others)... I have decided to move in with Deron and will not be renewing
my lease at the end of November.  I am really going to miss it, but the
reality is that I am rarely there, and the
I-need-to-start-saving-money-for-a-house side of me knows it is silly to
keep paying rent.

Oh, and I started a new job.. I work at Exult now
(ashley.streetman@exult.net).  We are a whopping 15 blocks away from Hewitt.

Some of my things are slowly trickling over to Deron's, but things should be
in good order to show.

Deron said he would be happy to post an ad for it/you at Hewitt in the Want
Ads database, if you would like (that is how I heard about it, from
Karen)... I have very nice things to say about the apartment and landlord,
so I would be very happy to reassure any prospective tenants that they would
be moving into an excellent place.

My new work phone is 281 539 6582.

:) ashley
