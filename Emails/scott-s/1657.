Ms. Sissy Crawford,

Thanks for the update on UT games.  Love those Aggies.  I heard Enron is 
going to sponsor a badminton player at the Olympics and of course you came to 
mind.  I need a review of the Bond film -- you seemed to be paying very close 
attention to it while I was a tad distracted, hopefully you can tell me about 
it.  I hope you are having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Bo
