> Parties To The PG&E Gas OII Settlement:
>
> Today, July 17, 2000, PG&E filed with the Commission the following two
> advice letters and attached tariffs to implement the Comprehensive PG&E
> Gas OII Settlement Agreement in accordance with Decision 00-05-049.  We
> sincerely appreciate the parties' efforts in helping to bring these
> tariffs together.
>
> As some parties suggested at our July 6, 2000 workshop on the draft
> tariffs, PG&E has divided the tariff package into two advice filings.
> Advice 2251-G pertains solely to the metering pilot programs.  Advice
> 2250-G contains all remaining tariffs to implement the Settlement
> Agreement.  Please note that Attachment 5 to Advice 2250-G includes an
> estimated implementation schedule that parties may find useful as a point
> of reference for the coming months.
>
> If you have any questions regarding this package, please do not hesitate
> to contact us at the numbers below.  Thanks again for your time and effort
> in helping to put this package together.
