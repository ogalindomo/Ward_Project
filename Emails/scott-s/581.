Here are the revised FERC637 Organization charts and Job Descriptions for 
posting.  I have changed all of the charts to show the date updated in 
addition to making the revisions identified in  E-mails sent earlier today 
and last week.  

The revised org charts are attached to the forwarded e-mail from Miranda 
Southard (MS) and the revised job descriptions are attached to this e-mail.
