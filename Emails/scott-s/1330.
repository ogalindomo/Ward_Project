Yes, the deal would have been for today.  I'm not sure who the trader was and 
Larry has already left for the day.  I will probably just leave a note for 
him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.  

Thanks,
 Susan

Subject: Re: Sumas deal w/ Larry May  

For today?  Also, do you know roughly what the of the deal is because I only 
see Chris Lambie's and John Mckay's deals
.
Today's deals do not contain any deals at Sumas with Larry May, again, I am 
speaking of John  Mckay and Chris Lambie.
