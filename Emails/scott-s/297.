Dear ALJ Biren:

The Indicated Producers plan to offer two exhibits:  Exhibit 10, the Prepared
Direct Testimony of Jean Marie Zaiontz, and Exhibit 11, the Prepared Direct
Testimony of Paul McKelvey.

We initially estimate the following cross-examination time, which may be 
adjusted
to coordinate with other Comprehensive Settlement parties.

Florio/Weil/Yap           .75  hours
Wright                         .5  hours

Please let me know if you have questions.
