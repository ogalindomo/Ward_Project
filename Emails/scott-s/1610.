Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted
