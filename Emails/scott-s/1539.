aegrotat (EE-gro-tat, ee-GRO-tat) noun

   An unclassified degree granted a university student who has fulfilled
   all requirements for graduation but was prevented by illness from
   attending the final examinations.

[From Latin aegrotat literally, he is sick, equivalent to aegrot(us) sick
(aeg(e)r sick + -otus adjectival suffix) + -at 3rd singular ending.]

   "Powell got a first in the exams he sat in the nursing home - his
   classics tripos finals. If he had not been able to sit them there, he
   would only have got an aegrotat degree - which might well have affected
   his future."
   Eric James, Deep rivers, indeed, New Statesman, Apr 24, 1998.
