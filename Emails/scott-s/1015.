Hi Girls!
It's that time again.  We need to get everyone together for our annual
Christmas Dinner.  I have spoken to many of you and tried to come up
with a good time for everyone.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be
a "perfect day", but how about Friday-Dec. 22nd?  Please respond and
tell me what you think.  I have had a few suggestions for a
place-Churrasco's, America's, Ruggles, Benji's, Sullivans-please send a
suggestion.  Don't say it doesn't matter because majority vote will win
and there will be no recount.  The time will probably be around 8 p.m.
I know the 22nd is close to Christmas, so the 19th has also been
suggested-but I am afraid not everyone will be in town yet.  Please send
me your thoughts on the day, restauraunt, and if we should plan
something after dinner.  I can't wait to see everyone and hope all can
make it!
