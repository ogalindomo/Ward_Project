Parties to the Gas OII PG&E Settlement:

Last week, on June 13th, PG&E held a workshop to discuss proposed tariffs to
implement the Comprehensive PG&E Settlement Agreement resolving all issues
concerning PG&E in the Gas Strategy Investigation at the CPUC.  At that
meeting, parties raised various issues concerning the draft tariffs we had
previously distributed, and we promised we would write up and provide the
parties with a list of these issues.  That list is attached.

Also attached is a schedule of next steps, including dates for PG&E to
provide responses to the issues raised at the tariff workshop, and for the
parties to provide further comments.  We have also decided to hold two
additional meetings to discuss tariff issues.  These are:

June 30, Friday, 10:00 a.m., Room 301b, 77 Beale St., SF
PG&E Hosts Half-Day Workshop on Metering Issues

July 6, Thursday,  1:30 p.m., Room 301b, 77 Beale St., SF
PG&E Hosts Half-Day Tariff Workshop on any Unresolved Issues

Thanks for all your help in finalizing these tariffs.
