Gentlemen,
Attached for your information find an electronic version of the Operator 
Balancing Agreement.  John, please check over to make sure we've got all the 
information filled-in correctly.  If acceptable, please produce two (2) 
executable documents from the electronic file, secure execution by Citizens' 
management and return the partially-executed documents to TW for our approval 
and execution.  If you have any questions, please give me a shout.
