   Confidential Settlement Document Under CPUC Rule 51

PARTIES:

This is a reminder that PG&E will host a Gas Accord II Settlement Workshop
next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, November 7th and 8th.  Please note, the
workshops will start promptly at 9:00 a.m. each day, and end around 4:00
p.m.  Among other things, these slightly longer sessions allow time for
feedback from the parties.  With this earlier start, we will provide a
continental breakfast as well as lunch on both days.  The Workshop will be
held at PG&E's headquarters, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.  We will be in
Conference Room 308 on Tuesday, and Conference Room 300 on Wednesday.

Please RSVP to Darcy Morrison, at e-mail D2Mr@pge.com, or by telephone at
(415) 973-6644, so that we can get a head-count for the meals.

Attached below is our proposed agenda for the November 7-8 Workshop.  The
topics include:  demand-supply forecast, supply reliability, capital cost
forecast, and backbone direct connection and local transmission rate design
options.  Although these subjects have been discussed at prior workshops,
our objective is to present additional detail and analysis so we can all
wrestle with some key issues and begin to formulate possible solutions.

Also, as we discussed at the last Workshop, we have set aside two hours at
the end of each day for observations and feedback from the parties.  Along
with the issues list, this will help PG&E to put together a proposal that
seeks to balance the many competing interests.

This is our last scheduled Workshop before we send out our first version of
a settlement proposal.  Our target date for this proposal remains December
8.

We look forward to seeing you next week.  Please call or E-mail us if you
have any questions or suggestions.
