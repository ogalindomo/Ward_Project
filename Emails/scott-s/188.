Subject: Draft Testimony on Why EGs Support the Comprehensive Settlement 

Here is the draft of my testimony on why electric generators support the 
Comprehensive Settlement.? Note that I have proposed to attach a study that 
we did for IEP showing a strong correlation between delivered gas prices to 
EGs and PX prices.? I have asked IEP to let me make the study public, and 
hope to get their OK tomorrow, at which time I will send that study to those 
of you that are not IEP members.
