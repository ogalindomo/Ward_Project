   "This is not theft, but kidnapping, summoning, prosopopoeia. In Eliot's
   earlier poem we still have one foot in another poet's hell. Here, Dante
   is summoned to the City of London, his lines marauded, his inferno woven
   within another of Eliot's own making."
   Joseph Dinunzio, Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909-1917,
   The Review of English Studies, Aug 1998.

This grand show is eternal. It is always sunrise somewhere: the dew is never
all dried at once: a shower is forever falling, vapor is ever rising. Eternal
sunrise, eternal sunset, eternal dawn and gloaming, on sea and continents and
islands, each in its turn, as the round earth rolls. -John Muir, naturalist,
explorer, and writer (1838-1914)
