Yes, I thought was to not take back space in the EOT area since we have some 
available and were not looking to expand there.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF
