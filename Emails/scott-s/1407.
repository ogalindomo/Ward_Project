Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold.
For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power
to hurt you. So in like manner you must grow in patience when you meet with
great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind. -Leonardo da
Vinci, painter, engineer, musician, and scientist (1452-1519)
