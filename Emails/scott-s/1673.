Hey,

I ran into Ann after lunch today and I remembered that y'all have a common 
friend who wanted to put you two in touch for volleyball.  I played briefly 
with Ann (who is quite the setter) before being removed from the team for 
"attitudinal differences".  Ann mentioned that she is currently playing once 
a week and may need another female player - I hope that doesn't play on 
Wednesday (steak night) or Thursday (Blancos, Deans etc.) because we know how 
important sitting outside and enjoying a cold beer is. Just chat with each 
other about it.  Otherwise, I hope both of your afternoons are going well.

Ted
