Mike,

The version of this that you sent out forgot the ".com" on Joe Paul's
address.  I forwarded a copy of it to him, but we want to correct it in
future forwardings, etc. of this letter.

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.  I do not feel they diminsh
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you
would expect.  They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural
events at the end of the letter.  If this gets them on the letter, I say
let's sign.  I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the
letter unless I hear differently from you by 3 pm today.  I really
appreciate the quick turnaround.  Mike Day

Mike,
Here are SoCal's proposed revisions to the CSA letter - I'll call in a
minute.  The edits are pretty extensive, but all along the lines we
discussed (ie changing the tone to a more positive one).
