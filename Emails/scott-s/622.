What a wonderful e-mail!  And you said you did not express yourself very
well - I beg to differ. Thank you - you have definitely made my day. I will
call this afternoon.

Ps. I need to check my e-mail more often!

Subject: are you there?


It occurred to me that you might log on and get your e-mail...

Just wanted to tell you you're on my mind, and that makes me happy even
though I am at the office on a Sunday!   You make me smile even when you
are thousands of miles away.   I think you are absolutely fabulous, or as
Goo would say, the cat's pajamas.

XXXOOO
