Gas OII Settlement Parties:

We are holding a workshop on tariffs to implement our Comprehensive Gas OII
Settlement on Tuesday morning, June 13 in San Francisco.  We will be meeting
in Conference Room 307, 77 Beale Street, which is PG&E's headquarters,
starting at 9:00 a.m.  We expect the workshop to conclude around 12:30 p.m.
A continental breakfast will be available around 8:30 a.m.

We will be reviewing the draft tariff package and responses to issues which
was sent by e-mail on May 25.  If you need a copy, please let me know.  WE
WOULD LIKE YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS ON THIS PACKAGE BY FRIDAY, JUNE 9, SO
WE CAN BE PREPARED TO RESPOND ON TUESDAY.

Our tariffs must be filed by July 17.  Therefore, we want to make sure we
have all the issues and concerns of the parties identified, if not resolved,
at the end of this workshop.

PLEASE RSVP TO BELINDA BATES AT (415) 973-6626  BY THURSDAY, JUNE 8 SO WE
CAN GET AN ACCURATE COUNT OF ATTENDEES.  We will also have conference call
capability for a limited number of participants, although this is not the
preferred means of participation.  When you RSVP, please let us know if you
want to call in, and we will then get back to you with the necessary
information for your call.

Thanks for your participation.
