Oh it is just one of those things that you just have to see/experience for 
yourself.  Words just can't describe the combination of leather and colorful 
Hawaiian prints. As for western wear, I will just have to rely on your 
advice. 

By the way, we have Fox Sports West on TV here on 29 and there is a match 
between USA and Brazil in Men's V-Ball.  These guys can jump but I am sure 
they wish they had your hops.

There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a 
non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the 
race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple 
classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.

-- I'm intrigued...what exactly is the Hawaiian Biker ensemble?
