ogre (O-guhr) noun

   1. A giant or monster in legends and fairy tales that eats human beings.

   2. A person who is felt to be particularly cruel, brutish, or hideous.

[French, probably ultimately from Latin Orcus, god of the underworld.]

   "As the ogres gorge themselves, the planks are pulled out, spilling them
   into the pit, and hot rocks and boiling water poured over them until they
   burn to death."
   Geraldine Nagle, The nightmare's mask, Parabola, Sep 22, 1998.
