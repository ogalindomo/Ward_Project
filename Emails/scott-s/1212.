Hey guys!

It is that time of year when everything gets SO crazy, so I am 
thinking.........
we need to plan our Taster's Finale ahead of time so we can all mark our
calendars and so we can find a place!

Here are some thoughts:  we could do a boy/girl Taster's where we all invite
some of our friends, guys and girls to join us and we rent out a room at a
restaurant.  Or we could have just girls and have a really nice Christmas
celebration at a cool restaurant and do "Secret Santa".  Either way, it would 
be
a blast.

How does Thursday, Dec 14th sound?

So, here is what I need:  your vote on............... the type of party, then
what restaurant that goes with that idea, then affirmation of the date.

Get excited girls!  This is going to be fun!

Love you guys,
Lisa
