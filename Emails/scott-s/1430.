Listed below is a brief description of each of the departments located in 
Portland:

West Power Trading
West Power Trading buys and sells wholesale electric power in the western 
US.  Wholesale power is a billion dollar industry involving utilities, 
municipalities, federal power agencies, and new market participants such as 
independent generators and energy services providers.  West Power Trading 
enters into a wide variety of financial transactions including forwards and 
options and is also an integral part of delivering physical energy within the 
western grid.

Scheduling
This group is responsible for scheduling all of Enron's WSCC deals.  Other 
responsibilities include:
Verify day-ahead balance with traders and communicate with courterparties to 
determine bookouts and physical paths.
Create NERC tags and complete internal communication and accounting.
Purchase transmission, co-ordinate options, enter daily deals, and balance 
the deal accounting system.

Fundamental Analysis
Fundamental  Analysis is managed by Tim Heizenrader and is mainly responsible 
for the following:
Identify, evaluate, and acquire fundamentals data from commercial and public 
sources.
Design and develop data acquisition, storage and display systems, and 
negotiate vendor contracts as needed to accomplish projects.    
Use advanced statistical analysis software, such as S-Plus, to perform 
exploratory data analysis on topical trading issues, including supply and 
demand anomalies and price movement.
Build a comprehensive electricity trading decision support system based on 
market fundamentals.

Settlements
This group is responsible for settling physical wholesale transactions with 
the California ISO and the California PX.  The group's primary function is to 
estimate revenues and expenses based on scheduled volumes, settle with the 
ISO based on actual volumes, and provide the accounting support to reconcile 
differences between scheduled and actual volumes.  

Risk Management
Primary responsibility is the daily administration of West Power trading risk 
books, including P&L, position reporting and trader support.  Also, 
individuals in this group are responsible for analyzing and reconciling daily 
and month-end P&L, preparing options reports, daily and month-end management 
reports, and setting up new trading books.

Middle Market
The Middle Market group is managed by Chris Foster and has the following main 
responsibilities:
Collect key data about utility and large industrial market participants.
Manage service accounts for customers who have outsourced certain trading, 
scheduling and accounting functions to EPMI.
Interact very closely with Cash Trading, Real Time Trading, and Volume 
Management groups.

Real Time Trading
This group is managed by John Forney and is responsible for the physical and 
financial integrity of prescheduled energy transactions.  Specifically, this 
includes re-supplying curtailed schedules and preserving  Enron's financial 
rights with non-performing trading counterparties.  The group is required to 
maintain records which explain such supply/market interruptions in order to 
minimize customer billing dispute issues.  In addition, Real Time Trading is 
responsible for the hourly trading of energy in the California ISO and 
bilateral markets.

Western Origination
This team is managed by Chris Calger and has offices in Portland and San 
Francisco.  The main responsibility of Western Origination is to develop 
business in the western United States specifically identifying and 
originating large commodity, asset and service transactions with investor and 
municipal owned gas and electric utilities.
