Subject: FW: Testimony to Support the SoCalGas Settlement Agreement 

To SoCal settlement parties, 

Attached please find the latest draft of Rick Counihan's testimony, as 
drafted by John Leslie. John asked me to distribute it as his email system is 
currently battling a virus. (I am using the distribution list that Brian 
Cherry used to distribute the Lad Lorenz draft testimony, which I believe 
reaches all parties.)

Please call John with any comments you may have on the draft. His number is 
619-699-2536. He cannot currently be reached by email.

Managing Director of SPURR and CUB
