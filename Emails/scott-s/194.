I only suggest one change on page 14 which uses the more specific language 
from the settlement.? I had to strain to find anything to comment on.? Looks 
good to me although others from SCG may have other comments.

Subject: Transwestern GIR Testimony 

Brian, 
I'm forwarding to you the first draft of Transwestern's GIR testimony.? As 
you can see, there are several holes yet to be filled in, particularly with 
respect to cites/references.? However, as concerns content, I'd appreciate 
any comments/proposed changes anyone would like to offer here.? I'm not 
sure if I have the latest Email distribution list, so please feel free to 
forward this on to anyone I've inadvertently left off.? Thanks.
