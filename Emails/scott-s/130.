Please note the following two errors in the documents emailed earlier
today.  In the Motion for Adoption of the Post-Interim Settlement
Agreement, the name of the Department of General Services should not have
been included in the text.  In the signature blocks of the Post-Interim
Settlement Agreement, the name "Dynegy" was inadvertently included.

Corrected versions will be emailed Wednesday, April 5.  I apologize for any
inconvenience.
