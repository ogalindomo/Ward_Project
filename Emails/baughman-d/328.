Don,
Please advise of your interest in the following Candidates.



I am attaching the resume for Tom Tahl. Tom is currently a Foreign Exchange 
Options Trader, for Deutsche Bank in N.Y.


 Jeff Gerl is an Internal Employee who is interested in the 24-hour Desk 
position.


Steven Coulter is an Agency submittal, I talked to Steven and he is very 
interested in opportunities. The dot com company he was working for closed 
it's doors on Friday, so he is "actively" looking.
