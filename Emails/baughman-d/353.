Subject: New regulatory attorney

T.J. Please forward to the group.  Thanks.



Please join me in welcoming Susan Scott.  Susan will be assisting East Power 
as a regulatory attorney.  Her phone is 30596.  She is currently sitting near 
the fundamentals group, but will be spending time near me by the real time 
desk learning the "ropes."
