Attached is the link to the main transmission study.

It contains some great bubble drawings as well as some key transmission 
information on major flowgates. 

Note it looks like TVA's transfer capability for the winter has been 
significantly been reduced versus the 99/00 study.

Please review this document for significant items that affect your markets 
and prepare an applicable brief for your traders.

thanks.
