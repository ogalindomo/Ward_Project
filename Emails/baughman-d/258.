When entering deals into the P&L please use the drop down box for the 
counterparties.  Rao has developed a comparison activity report that will 
compare enpower to the p&l for us.  If we can enter our deals using the drop 
down  box then he can finish cleaning up the last few bugs so that we can get 
it into production in the next couple of days.

Thanks
Kayne
