Don,
Thanks for your time yesterday, I will be putting together a press kit that
we can hand out to the different departments at
Enron.  Whenever you get the chance if you could send over the names and
titles of the different departments it would really help.  I will be back in
contact with you and lets try to set up next Wed. for some drinks after
work.  Have a great time in Vegas and Good Luck.  Tell hair guy hello.

Regards,
Jeff
