We have begun beta testing our 3 new indexes: TVA, ComEd, and ERCOT. If you
could please share the attached template with everyone on the hourly desk at
night, we would really appreciate it! It is very similar to the one before,
but it includes the new indexes. As always, any indicative prices are very
welcomed!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. Thank you so much for
your time.
