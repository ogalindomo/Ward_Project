Subject: SOCO Tariff Revisions

Kayne,

FYI, SOCO has asked FERC to accept revisions to its OATT. These revisions 
include new source and sink language identical to the Entergy attachment M. 
To summarize the source and sink revisions:

1) All transactions sinking in SOCO must show a valid load bus.
2) All transactions sourcing in SOCO must show a valid generator bus.
3) Sinks off of the SOCO system must be a valid load control area (No 
generation only CA)
4) Sources off of the SOCO system must be a valid generation control area (No 
load only CA)

It will take FERC a month or so to approve but we expect it to be approved an 
be applied retroactively to December 14, 2000.

If you have any questions or would like to see the filing, let me or Christi 
Nicolay know.

Thanks,
Bill Rust
