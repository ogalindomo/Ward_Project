Attached are two of TradersNews Energy's three new  hourly indexes, for the 
ComEd and TVA hubs. We will send you these new hourly  indexes at no charge 
until March 19, when we formally launch them on our Web  site, at 
www.tradersnewsenergy.com.
?
If you'd like to receive our ERCOT hourly index or have questions or  
feedback about that region, e-mail Suzanna Strangmeier, at 
suzanna.strangmeier@ipgdirect.com.

Otherwise, please contact me with any feedback or  questions. Thank you.
