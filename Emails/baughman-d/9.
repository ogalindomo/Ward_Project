Subject: ERCOT Portal Release 2



> The 'Web Enablement' team has finished work on
> the second release of the portal, and it is now
> accessible. The following information is also
> available on www.texaschoiceprogram.com.
> What is the ERCOT portal?
> The ERCOT portal will consolidate information
> from a variety of sources into a customizable &
> comprehensive view of business activity relative
> to each market participant. Functions available
> via the portal will include viewing status of
> transactions, access to the market operations
> systems, bid submission, and more. Security
> features will determine the data and functions
> available to each market participant.
>
>
> What is the portal release 2 for the ERCOT
> portal?
> The portal release 2 is a pre-release version of
> the portal that will include static web pages
> that have no functional behavior. The purpose of
> this release is to provide exposure to the
> portal user interface look and feel, and not to
> demonstrate specific portal functionality. This
> is not intended to be a final product release.
> The functional component of the portal is
> currently under development, and will not be
> fully tested in a manner that is suitable for
> public release by 10/31. (This includes client
> side validation, file upload, error pages,
> confirmation pages, etc.) Future portal releases
> will have these features enabled.  Unlike the
> earlier proof of concept release, no usability
> tests will be conducted on the release 2 portal
> version. Because the portal will contain static
> view-only user interfaces, there is no back end
> systems integration between the portal and
> Siebel, LODESTAR, etc.
> How can you access the portal release 2 version
> of the portal?
> The address for the portal release 2 version of
> the portal is:
>
> https://portal.texaschoiceprogram.com
>
> To access the portal follow these instructions:
>
> Note: Before you can access the portal, you must
> access and install a digital certificate.
>
> Launch and review the attached document titled,
> 'Accessing the Portal'. It provides you with
> instructions on how to access and install a
> digital certificate and how to log in to the
> portal.
>
> Important: To access the portal, you must need
> Internet Explorer 5.01 with Service Pack 1 on
> your computer.
