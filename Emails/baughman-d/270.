Subject: Request MAPPF Reservation # 408746 to be ANNULLED



Enron requests Transcoord for MAPP Transmission Service to ANNUL
reservation no. 408746.  The reason is as follows:

Reservation # 408746 was requested at 15:31:09 on 3/19/2001 for
transmission service for 15 mw during 17:00 thru 21:00 on 3/19/2001.  NERC
tag # EPMI518 was submitted 2001-03-19 15:44 for the path =
AMRN-NSP-MAPP-GRE and was subsequently denied by NSP and AMRN due to lack
of ATC due to line outage.

EPMI rescheduled the energy on reservation #s 408755 (HE 18) & 408758 (HE
19-21) from NSP and DPC respectively.

Thank you in advance for your assistance on this matter.
