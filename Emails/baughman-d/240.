Gracias amigo, I really appreciate it.  I'm sure I'll have some good
stories to tell, when I get back.  I'll holler at you next week.

Later,

Don

PS Do you want me to put $20 on black for you?

Don,
Ellen should be e-mailing you the history in a few minutes.  Have a good
trip and I will speak with you next week regarding
cocktails.
