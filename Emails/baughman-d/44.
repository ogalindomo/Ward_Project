Kayne,

This has been happening with greater frequency (this is the sixth time this 
month) - where an hourly trader has added mws to 
a DP&L deal with no basis for the change.  Normally the unrouted mws which 
trigger them to think they need an extra
schedule is due to misrouting of transmission and deals bring in the wrong 
time zones.

Please could you review this problem with Greg and the others in your group.

Thanks,

Rebecca
