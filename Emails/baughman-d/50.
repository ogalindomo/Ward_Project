Please send the following to all of East Power:

A re-org memo was sent all Enron North America employees yesterday.   A 
statement was made regarding the sale of ENA's "East Coast Power" facilites 
(Linden, Bayonne & Camden NJ) which are currently jointly owned with El Paso 
Energy.

The sale is not yet final and involves another party that could potentially 
hold up the transaction if they had knowledge of the pending sale.   
Therefore, it is imperative that no discussions take place regarding this 
pending sale.   If the third party were to discover the assets were going to 
be sold, the $$ value of the transaction to ENE's shareholders could be 
negatively effected.

Please respect the internal & external confidentiality of this transaction.
