Hi, Don--

I forwarded your request to Jeff Maack, at 713/647-8802, and he'll work with
you pronto.

Next order of business: I understand we're getting together for a Happy Hour
soon? We look forward to it. What day next week is good for y'all, or shall
I check with J.D. or Rudy about it?

Thanks!
Bobette
