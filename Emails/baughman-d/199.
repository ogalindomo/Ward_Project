Don,
I wanted to see if you would be available one day next week for a meeting to
discuss TraderNews and Enron. Tuesday or Wednesday at anytime that works for
you is great.  I would like to come over and see your trading floor if you
don't mind.
I also have a meeting Downtown on this Thursday afternoon, if you have a
time for a few drinks at Ninfas let me know.


Regards,
Jeff Maack
