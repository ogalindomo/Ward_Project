Mr. Baughman,

Thank you for your fax! Just wanted to verify the SPP information we have.
The information does not have the typical Bid (under price column) and Ask
(under volume column). For accuracy, could you confirm at your earliest
conveinence: what, if any, information is or is not indicitive? Thank you
sir!
Respectfully,
