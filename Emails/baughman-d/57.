I wasn't sure if we needed to send out the report since it was a half holiday 
for most companies, so i opted not to. I didn't send one Monday since it was 
a nerc holiday.  Hopefully she won't call and give you shit about it. Plus we 
didnt have prices in so your guess is much better than mine as to what 
actually happened.
Thanks
