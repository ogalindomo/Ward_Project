On Tuesday January 16th at 23:00 CST maintenance will be preformed on the
MAPP OASIS Database Server. If things go as planned there will be no down
time. If
I run into problems there may be an outage of 2 to 2.5 hours. This is a
precautionary message to keep everyone informed of possible OASIS Outages. I
will send another message when maintenance is complete.
