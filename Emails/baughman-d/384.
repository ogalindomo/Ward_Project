Subject: Error in MDEA in P&L application

Rao,
The P&L application has a error in it.  Discrepancies are occuring on the 
location of MDEA deal information within the P&L application.  

Deals entered on the hourly tabs on the sheet labled "MDEA-SVCE" are not all 
appearing on the sheet labeled "Checkout".  Alternatively, some deals 
appearing on the "checkout" sheet are not apppearing on the hourly tabs.  
Please take a look at this and make whatever corrections are necessary.
