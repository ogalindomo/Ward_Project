Hi guys, trying to clean up Feb outstanding issues.  Looks like we should 
have a deal with Sanchez at the above referenced meter.  Currently, strangers 
gas is getting the flow.  

Could you let me know if this is valid or not?  Settlements needs to know 
ASAP.  Seems an invoice for the gas has been received.

Thanks!!
