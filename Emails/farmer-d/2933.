Daren,
Thanks for the Sitara training class that you taught the logistics group.  It 
was extremely valuable
for me and the rest of the group.  I appreciate all the time and effort that 
you put into setting this up.
The handouts will be great reference material for us in the future.  I have 
already heard  very positive 
feedback from the group.  Very much appreciated.  Thanks again,   Pat Clynes
