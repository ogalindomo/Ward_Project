Robert/Tom,

The following production commenced to flow earlier in the week and a ticket 
should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period

Range Resources Corporation  9832   350mmbtu/d  100% GasDaily less $0.18 5/30 
- 5/31


FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for June 
and for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of July once 
she recieves a reserve study.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal 
and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the 
gathering contract.


Thanks,
