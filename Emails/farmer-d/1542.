Aimee, 
Are you confirming these volumes with HL&P?  We have been doing some special 
deals at Green's Bayou and the HL&P dealmaker has been calling to find out 
what the volumes are.  I do not think he communicates with his scheduler, is 
that the case?  Anyway, we need to agree with HL&P on what volumes flowed on 
these special days and get them into the system so they can be billed 
correctly.

Ed - when you have a chance, I would like to go over this with you.
