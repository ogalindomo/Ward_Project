Please find attached my notes on the 3 different options that we discussed on 
last Thursday.  Please review the options carefully and send me your 
revisions/amendments by the end of the day tomorrow and I will send out a 
"final" options list.  Particular help is needed on option 3.
We can take those options with us when we meet with Brenda on Wednesday.

ONCE AGAIN THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR IDEAS AND CO-OPERATION.
