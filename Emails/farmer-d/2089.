Thanks for the info Heidi.  It's always good to have a second pair of eyes 
with all these wells.  I have done some research and all but  one are HPLC 
deals and were not putting those on the gathering contract.  I'll run this by 
Daren and make the changes if needed.  Please let me know if you see anything 
else it just takes a minute to check on it.
