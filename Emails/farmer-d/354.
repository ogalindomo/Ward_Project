Daren:
There is a spot deal and an exchange deal for 9/6.  The spot deal is 391119 
and the exchange deal is 231758.  They both have the same volume scheduled, 
10,545 MMBtu.  Which deal do we use?  Duke shows the volume on the exchange 
deal.  There is also spot deal 387571 for day 6, but I think it's OK.  The 
deal was for 30,000 MMBtu and we have an actual of 29,420 MMBtu
