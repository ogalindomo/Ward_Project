3. New Website Feature Details

Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20

4. New Stack Manager Features

The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi=
ll=20
notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which wi=
ll=20
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe=
rs=20
against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a=
=20
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed=
=20
against that product.

Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same=
=20
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you =
to=20
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t=
he=20
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price=
=20
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde=
rs=20
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.

It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P=
roduct=20
Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, mak=
e=20
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope=
rties=018=20
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers=
=20
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.
