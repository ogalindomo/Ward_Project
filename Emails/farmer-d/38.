The Texas Logistics desk has reservation at The Stables at Main and 
Greenbriar  for Wed. the 13th at 11:45 am for our Christmas Luncheon.  We are 
planning on having a Christmas gift fight at some point during the lunch, so, 
please plan on bringing a present....net present value of $10.00.  This is 
alot of fun, so I hope to see everyone there.  We will arrange some 
carpooling on Tuesday or Wednesday am (if you can take four or more with you, 
please let me know).

Thank you,

Mary
