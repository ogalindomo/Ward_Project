Daren informed me that Tenaska will continue to nominate the Cornhusker 
business for another week or so, until all the paperwork is signed.  But, we 
will be taking this over for September shortly.

Thanks,
Mark

I was informed by Nancy Stivers at Tenaska that Rich Hill with Enron called 
Tenaska and requested that they continue to handle the nominations and 
accounting for Cornhusker through September.  Have you heard this?
