The MTBE plant will continue operating at lower production rates of 
approximately 8 MBD to 9 MBD until April 6 or 7 at the earliest.  It will 
possibly be mid-April before full production can be resumed.  This is the 
result of the steam boiler problem experienced on Friday, March 24.  When 
more information is available, this will be updated.
