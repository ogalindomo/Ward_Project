Attached, please find our calculation sheet for Feb. 2000 production.  Please 
review it and let me know if you have any questions.



At this time, it appears that we owe Pan Energy $56,562.68.  
This amount, however, does not include the re-delivery fuel charges from PG& 
E that will be passed back to Pan Energy.  
As soon as we receive the information from PG& E, we will bill you 
accordingly.  

Thanks -Katherine (713) 345-8643
