George,
I need the following done:

Jan 13
Zero out 012-27049-02-001 Receipt  Package Id 2666
Allocate flow of 149 to 012-64610-02-055 Deliv Package Id 392

Jan 26
Zero out 012-27049-02-001 Receipt Package Id 3011
Zero out 012-64610-02-055 Deliv Package Id 392

These were buybacks that were incorrectly nominated to transport contracts 
(ECT 201 Receipt)

Let me know when this is done
HC
