Subject: EEX - Meter

Julie, 

Just an FYI, I sent a ticket down to Mick last night for EEX E&P, Meter 
6500.  George is requesting that a contract be sent to them for execution, 
but in the mean time, please send out a First Purchaser GTC on this one. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thank you, 
Melissa
