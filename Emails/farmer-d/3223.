Daren,

This didn't help as I am unable to access any information on the file.

Subject: April Wellhead Production Estimate

Bob,

Please see the attached file calculating an estimate of wellhead production 
for the month of April, 2001.  Please be advised that this is a preliminary 
estimate as I have yet to meet with the gas buyers and I have not received 
any customer nominations.  Our pre-nom meeting is on tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

Thanks,
