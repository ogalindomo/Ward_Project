Tell me what you think of this map.  It has a little more detail including 
storage, miles, etc. but lacks LRC pipe.  This map came from our Graphics 
dept.

  This is a power point file.  This map was originally an Illustrator file 
and we have a Tif format if you need those as well.  Thanks Kevin, good 
hearing from you.
