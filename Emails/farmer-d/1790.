Loraine sent an allocation for fuel that is not scheduled.   Her schedule has 
fuel on days where there was no flow:
Day fuel
5 40
8 15
9 14

Can you let me know if we need to book fuel on this contract and what needs 
to be done on days where we have no flow?

We called Loraine and she told us to contact you since you are aware of this.

Thanks
