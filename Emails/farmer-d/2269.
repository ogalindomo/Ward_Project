This particular meter looks okay today, so should not be impacting UA4.  Will 
keep you posted if I find any other problems.

I looked at our p&l tonite and our UA4 volumes actually increased by about 
90,000 MMBtu's for a grand total of 550,000 MMBtu's for the month. I don't 
know if they fixed this problem or not. If you have any information please 
let me know.
Thanks.
Bryan

Scheduling says that they have corrected, but no telling what may happen 
overnight.  If you run your P&L this evening, you should be okay.
