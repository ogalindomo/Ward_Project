Gas Daily for any mid month turn on as in our purchase contracts

Letter of credit must be approved prior to Sept 1 (they said they will have 
it Monday by 2pm)

volume min/max is 7,000/day - 20,000/day with same tolerance currently 
existing for swing.(we expect to level out around 10,000/d)

Please call if you have any concerns as we will continue this gas flow
