Everyone,

Sometime after the close of business on  Wednesday, January 10th, Sitara 
Reporting will be migrated to a new version of Oracle reports. Oracle 6.0 
provides some needed benefits, such as, the ability to process reports on 
multiple servers which should help performance during peak times. Also, 
Oracle 6.0 provides the ability to create comma delimited files which can 
then be imported into Excel.

This migration, for the most part, will be transparent. If you use the Sitara 
launch pad, you will be directed to the new report server. For those of you 
who use Internet Explorer favorites to access Sitara Reporting, please update 
your favorite to point to the new Report server 
athttp://sitrpt.corp.enron.com.  All the same reports will be available. 
However, some of the reports will function a little differently. These 
changes were requested several months ago but were not moved to production 
until now.

If you know of anyone using Sitara Reporting but are not in the above list of 
people, please forward this e-mail to them.

Thank You,

Terry Sanvido
