Gary,

Could you please remove  SCADA/MIPS from the following HPL meters. These 
meters are where Mid-Texas interconnects with
PG & E's system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on HPL. 
These meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on Mid-Texas should automatically have a corresponding meter 
on HPL. This assumption is now incorecct.
