Daren:

On May 31,2000, the above meter flowed 15 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.  This 
is the only day that this meter flowed  during the period of 1/1/99 thru 
11/30/00.

Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistic 
needs approval to writeoff this volume to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please 
print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).
