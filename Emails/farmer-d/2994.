According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, there is 
nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I checked 
MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate of 
7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?  

Thanks, Stella
