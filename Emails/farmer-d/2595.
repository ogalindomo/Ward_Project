Subject: HPL System Brown Bag

Please plan on attending a training session over lunch on Tuesday, Feb 15th.  
(Lunch will be provided.)  I intend to discuss the operations of Houston Pipe 
Line;  how gas is moved through the system, where our main supply and market 
areas are, locations of specific points, etc.  We will be using a map of the 
pipeline as the basis for the discussion.  So, come to the meeting with any 
questions you have on HPL, anything is fair game.

Yvette is currently working on securing a room.  I will let you know when 
that is finalized.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
