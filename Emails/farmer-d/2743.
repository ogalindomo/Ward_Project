Subject: Equistar

Equistar has requested a scheduling/nomination change retroactive to January 
1. 

At the start of the month, Janice nominated a small volume to meter # 1165 
(or maybe it was to # 1266), DuPont Victoria.

Equistar wants that volume to go to meter # 1552 instead, for the whole month 
of Jan.

Any questions - call me at 3.5923

Thanks

Lee
