We are still experiencing problems in bringing up the hardware from last 
night's emergency outage.  As of 5:30 AM you cannot access the application.  
Every attempt is being made to rectify this problem.  Once the application is 
available, please stay out of position manager and use CPR Positions until 
you have been notified.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Scott Mills
