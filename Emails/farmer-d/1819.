Conoco supply from El Paso #9DWE was cut into Oasis:

5/21 nom 10,000 cut to 9,399  (cut of 601)
5/22 nom 10,000 cut to 8,312 (cut of 1,688)

Delivery into HPL from Oasis Katy kept whole.

I entered these cuts in the estimate column in MOPS for both Oasis/HPL & 
Oasis/ENA....please verify that is correct.

Thanks,
Mark
