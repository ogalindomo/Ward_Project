I will be taking a sabbatical beginning any moment.  I have no control over 
the exact time; it may have already happened.  I plan to visit the mountains 
and the ocean.  They miss me. I miss them.  

Unfortunately, Enron requires employees to use vacation time instead of Inner 
Self time, so I will have to return someday.  Looks like July 5th.  I'm kind 
of bummed about it, but maybe by then I will have transcended to a new 
plateau of understanding.

In my absence, contact Milind Patil, x39247 for Unify performance issues.

Thanks for understanding,

spell my new name)
