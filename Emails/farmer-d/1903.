Subject: new Unify Transaction/Volume Count reports

These 2 new reports are now available in 
Start/Programs/Trading/Unify (Gas-Reporting).  This password should be the 
same as your Unify (Gas) password.

Go to Path Manager/Report/General Report Selection/Path Manager.

The two new reports are Monthly Transaction Counts and Monthly Volume Counts.

Enjoy, d.n.
