On 8/1/99 recorded flow of 9 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.  Currently, this 
volume is being booked to the HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs 
either (10 Deal issued, or (2) approval to write-off this volume to 
Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to Clem 
Cernosek).
