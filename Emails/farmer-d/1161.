Gentlemen,

I wanted to clarify the length of the outage that started today at the 
Cleburne site. 

The earliest the plant will be on-line is Wednesday morning. If anything is 
found beyond a cracked transition piece or clogged fuel nozzle then it may 
extend the outage a few days. As soon as I hear something I will let you know.
