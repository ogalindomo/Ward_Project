This is the initial merger/name change notice for March 2000. 

I will update the counterparty records with the new legal names tomorrow, 
3/14,  unless I hear from someone that this is an issue. Copies of the 
documents will be sent out this afternoon. 




I do have additional information to send out later this month.  If there are 
any questions, please give us call. Thanks!
