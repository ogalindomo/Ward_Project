Just to clarify, I was in the February 2000 report in error when I sent the 
report out to everyone.  Please notice at the bottom of the report that there 
is a worksheet tab for August 2000 and that is where the current information 
is located.  I apologize for the confusion.

Also, the ERMS Shortname changes will be made this afternoon 8/24.
