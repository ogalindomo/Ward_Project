Some people are having problems getting the new monitor - 

You may not have the SU bridge under your - 
Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge Monitor. 
To resolve this - you will need to fill out a security request to get it 
added to your start up profile.

Also - if you are using an old shortcut - this may no longer work - you need 
to trash the old short cut.
