Effective 3/1/2000, please increase our nom to 60,000 MMBtu
per day into Eastrans.  The redeliveries will
come from:

Fuels Cotton Valley 7,000
Into PG & E         50,000
Into pipe of your choice at Carthage Hub 3,000

Thanks.  I realize that the contract requires earlier notice
for the 1st.  If there is a problem, let me know and we can
do the 3,000 on the 2nd.  In any case, we want to max out
PG & E at 50,000,and 7,000 from FCV.
