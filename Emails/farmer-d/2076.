This is to nominate 27,800 MMBtu/d for 4/11 into Eastrans.

20,000 MMBtu/d will be redelivered into PG & E, the rest into
HPL from Fuels Cotton Valley.

We plan to begin receiving the gas at 3:00 pm or so and take
more volume to average the nominated quantity for the day.

As I indicated on the phone, it will also be necessary to
deliver more into PG & E after flow starts to average
nominated quantity.

Thanks.
