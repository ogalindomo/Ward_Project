Yes. I have confirmed that FW Rabalais is agent for Dallas (aka Sam Allen), 
which was put under Lila Allen's name. Please change Deal 144932 from Sam 
Allen to Dallas Exploration.

I looked in Global and Dallas Exploration is in there.  Can we put the deal 
under Dallas Exploration?  That is where is it was set up at Columbia.  I 
have a letter and the GISB contract from Sam Allen that we are to pay Dallas 
Exploration.
