At approximately 11:00 AM on Tuesday, January 11, 2000, meter 986240 El 
Campon/Shanghai Common Point was shut in due to a leak on a 6" lateral off of 
the Edna 24".  The meter will be shut in until late Thursday or early on 
Friday, January 13 or 14, after repairs are complete.

If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

Thanks
