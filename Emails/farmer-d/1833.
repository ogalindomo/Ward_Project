The MTBE plant went down about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, May 20, as a 
result of power failure.  Apparently lightning knocked out the power 
substation. 

The oleflex is starting up, along with the MTBE plant, and butamer.  Some 
production is expected tonight with full rains possibly attained tomorrow.
