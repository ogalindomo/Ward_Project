The POPS Production database server will be down over the weekend for a 3 
hour period
for memory upgrade. Please let me know if there is a preferred 3hr window, if 
there is
no problem with y'all,  can we will request the maintenance  between 12-3pm 
Saturday 10/21/00.

I'll inform y'all of the actual timeframe once its finalized, since there are 
other systems
running on that server.

thanks
Romeo

Subject: downtime request


The UNIX Infrastructure team  would like to request downtime on system
'aurora' this weekend.  The system has 2 faulty memory simms that we need
to replace BEFORE they cause a problem.  We are requesting 3 hours to
perform the memory replacement.  The following databases would be effected:

eqtprod
dcfprod
popprod
trdprod
semprod
sitprod2
infprd53

Please let me know if/when we can have time for this maintenance.
