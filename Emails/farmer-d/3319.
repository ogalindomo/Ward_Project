Aimee, our scheduled maintenance starts Saturday night at midnight and will
continue most of the month, per our scheduled maintenance letter sent in
January. The plant should burn around 85,000 on Saturday. Beginning Sunday
until the end of the maintenance period, the estimate will be 65,000 to
68,000. I will be out of the office Monday and will update the volumes on
Tuesday. If you have question call Aron Childers at 713-830-8811. Thanks.
