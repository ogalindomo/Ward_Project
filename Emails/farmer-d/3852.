Deal #124400 was at this meter during November 1999, but it expired on 
11/30/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers 
Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1) Deal #124400 extended, (2) new 
deal, or (3) approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  
(Please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).
