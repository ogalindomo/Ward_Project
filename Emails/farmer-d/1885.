I will be in class next week at the Hyatt.  If you have Unify performance 
issues that need immediate attention, please call:
Jim Ogg 5-7225
Kishore B. 3-0347
Russ Whitton 3-3874
You already have my pager number.

Also, for the next 2 months while our office space is being gutted and 
re-built, I will be located in 3 Allen Center, 37th floor.  How convenient.
I will have the same phone number.  Feel free to send me a postcard ;-)
