ONE MORE THING - NEXT YEAR YOU WILL BE BILLED FOR INHOUSE TRAINING - PLEASE
INCLUDE THESE CLASSES WITH THE OTHER TRAINING YOUR ARE SCHEDULEING.  IF YOU
GIVE THE CLASS, I WILL PUT IN THE COSTS (THANKS TO JEFF SORENSON FOR ASKING 
ABOUT
THIS)



I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS - WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING IN YOUR SALRIES - 

 DO NOT INCLUDE ANALSYST SALARIES!!!  

THESE ARE CHARGED AT A SPECIFIC AMOUNT TO YOUR RC, REGARDLESS OF THE
ACTUAL SALARY OF THE ANALSYT.  JUST GIVE ME THE TOTAL SALARIES OF ANY
NON-ANALYSTS, AND THE NUMBER OF ANALYSTS YOU HAVE.  I WILL PUT IN THE
SALARY ALLOCATIONS FOR THE ANALYSTS (ABOUT $4,000 PER MONTH).

THANKS, DIANE





PLEASE FILL IN THE ATTACHED BUDGET QUESTIONAIRE AND RETURN TO ME NO LATER

IF YOU HAVE NOT TURNED IN YOUR STAFFING FOR 2001, PLEASE TURN THAT IN TODAY.



IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CALL ME AT X37059.

Thanks, Diane
