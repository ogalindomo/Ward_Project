The Popsprd bridge will be migrated to Nahou-Scacl1 on April 26th for 
debugging purposes. This migration should be transparent for Pops users with 
the exception of personal spread sheets using Pops tags. The node name for 
Pops tags on personal spread sheets will need to be changed to Nahou-Scacl1 
to allow for updating of Pops data.


Please call me if you have any questions concerning the migration.
