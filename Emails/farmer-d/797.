Subject: 2001 Budgets

I will be working you each of you to create your 2001 budget. 

The first draft of the 2001 budget is due on September 18th.
I will be doing most of the work, I will just need a little
bit of information from you!

For starters, I need your staffing requirements for 2001.  Attached is a 
worksheet
for you to enter what your approved staffing level is today, and any staff 
adds you
think you will need by the end of next year.

BE SURE TO ADD THE BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION FOR ANY STAFF ADDS.

First fill in your approved staff for Sept 2000, then just change any month 
with a staff
add, it will populate accross the rest of the months.  Type your justifcation 
at the
bottom of the form.

PLEASE TURN IN YOUR 2001 STAFFING BY SEPTEMBER 11, END OF BUSINESS.

We will discuss your staffing requirements at Steve's Tuesday staff meeting.

Thanks!
