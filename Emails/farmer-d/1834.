Hi Everyone,
 See attached a listing of the documented enhancements that pertain to ENA 
Upstream.  What we need to do next is develop an impact for each one that 
gives an estimate of the number of hours saved for each item.  Please supply 
these savings where your name is listed if you haven't already done so.  The 
vision and purpose of this list is to provide Holland & Davis ( a consultant 
) and upper management with the necessary information to determine the extent 
of IT resources that would be needed to enhance Unify.  I will need your 
replies by COB May 31st.  

 

Thanks,  MVE
