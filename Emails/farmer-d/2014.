Attached is a summary of the days Calpine has claimed force majeure beginning 
7/1/99.

The file is located in the 99Calpine directory under logistics if you wish to 
make changes.

I left  cells blank where I could not locate the information.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kris
