Stacey,

Settlements has brought an invoice to zero out a sale of 10,000 mmbtu to El 
Paso Merchant Energy for 4/20/00 on PGEV.  There are 2 packages of  5000 deal 
numbers 247426 and 247583 on the market side and deal 247676 on the supply 
side.  These are HPLC brokered deal on PGEV that are buying and selling the 
same 10,000 to El Paso Merchant Energy.  The purchase and sale price is the 
same $3.02.  I do not know the intent of these deals so I am hesitant to just 
zero out the volume.   Will you let me know if that is okay?
