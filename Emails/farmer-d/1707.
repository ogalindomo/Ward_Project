Subject: Nomination Change


On Monday June 5th thru June 8th, the Quinduno Field connected to the Oneok 
Stinnett Plant will be shut in by Oneok for maintenance.  The production 
should be back on the afternoon of June 8th and our nomination should be in 
place for the 9th.  Sorry about the short notice but I just confirmed with 
Oneok that this was going to happen.
