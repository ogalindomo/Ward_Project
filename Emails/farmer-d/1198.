Attached are the co-owners volumes.  I will furnish revised Devon volumes 
this afternoon.  I noticed you have a PVR of 10% on the American Central 
volumes.  Chad Cass at Duke says this should be closer to 22%.  The 10% 
applies to MCF.

Thanks,
Steve

Good afternoon....

Do you have any co-owners volumes yet?  or any revisions from the previous
e-mail?

Thanks,
Beverly
