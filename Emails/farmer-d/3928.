Daren:

On 9/24/99, the above meter recorded flow of 437 Mmbtus.  There was no deal 
at this meter the month prior or after.  Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).
