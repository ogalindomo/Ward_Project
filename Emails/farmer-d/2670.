Attached are the notes captured from the whiteboard and discussions on 
Wednesday (as best as I can decipher).  Please note the next steps we 
discussed:

Commitment of key subject experts (who, how much time dedicated)
Establishment of the project steering team
Detail out high level use cases

Thanks for your participation in the meeting, and I look forward to working 
with you to create another great system.
