Daren the stuff outlined in bold execpt for the Helmerich and Payne will be 
spot tickets per Vance due to no flow till after the 1st..  All the engage 
stuff in Vances file will be spot deals as they were last month  that totals 
1904.   Also in Vances file is the EEX Corporation stuff that will also be 
spot tickets that totals 12945.  Every thing else is a go.  Let lme know if
