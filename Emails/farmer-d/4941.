The affected data is the service-related "accounting" data generated when you 
run balancing.

For any service-related balancing you might have run since Thursday night, 
please run the Balancing process again for those pipes/dates.

You do NOT need to re-path anything, and you do NOT need to run Tracking 
again, only Balancing.  You can even change the Path Type to be "Service" 
instead of "Both"; this will help it run faster.

Sorry for the end-of-month problem, but the data loss was due to a data base 
problem beyond our control.  This was not part of the data base maintenance 
we had scheduled for this weekend (which was completed sucessfully).

Thanks, d.n.

Subject: UNIFY GASP Data Problems

We encountered some unrecoverable errors last night on the AALQ table.   All 
data from Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will need to be re-processed.  The 
recovery process is now complete and UNIFY GASP is once again available.  We 
apologize for the inconvenience.  Regards,

Jim O.
