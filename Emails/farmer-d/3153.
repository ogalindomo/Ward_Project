Subject: Revised HPLC Purchase Estimates - April 2001


Bob:

We have just been advised by EPGT (El Paso) that they will be processing
the  S.G. Marshall gas April 2001; therefore, EOGR will have to reduce the
volume that will be available for sale to HPL.  The new estimate is 3,400
mmbtu/day.

Thanks.
