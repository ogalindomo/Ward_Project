We are pleased to announce that as of Monday, Sept. 18, the new version of 
EnronOnline will be launched to all our customers. 

When our customers log in on this day, they will be given the option to 
upgrade to the new version. They can choose to immediately upgrade, or to 
upgrade at a later time.

If the customers choose to upgrade, they will be taken through the same steps 
as when you upgraded. If the customers choose not to upgrade, they will 
receive a version of EnronOnline which is the same as the "old" version, but 
the colors will be blue, instead of black.

Customers who choose not to immediately upgrade can can do so at a later time 
by pressing the "Upgrade to Version 2" button in the top left corner of their 
screen.

Some customers may have browser or firewall restrictions which could cause 
difficulties in upgrading to the new version of EnronOnline. We have 
EnronOnline Help Desk and IT troubleshooters standing by to help anyone in 
this situation. For assistance, please direct calls to:

   North America 713 853 4357
   Europe  + 44 20 7783 7783
   Australia/Asia + 61 2 9229 2300

EnronOnline marketing personnel will be calling customers to help guide them 
through the new features, but it would be appreciated if you could also point 
out some of the new features when you are talking to your customers.

As of Monday, all internal users should also use the usual 
www.enrononline.com to get to the new version.

Thank you for your assistance in making EnronOnline a success.
