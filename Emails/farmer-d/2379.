Reminder:

This Thursday, March 9th is the Management Team Off-Site Follow Up Meeting, 
we will be returning to the Plaza Club.  We will have lunch at 11:30 and 
resume the meeting to cover the Training issues that were not discussed 
prior.   If there are any other issues that you would like to see revisited 
or covered, please let me know by Wednesday.

Remember, we will be walking so . . . . .
