Per my conversation today with Lorraine Ibrom @ PG&E, she has informed that 
some maintenance work is being done at Yeary Midway 20 in.  This will affect 
meters 6040 PG&E Riverside and 584 PG&E Agua Dulce, beginning at 9:00 a.m. on 
Sunday, Sept. 10, 2000 and ending at 9:00 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2000 at 
9:00 a.m.  She has informed me that for this time period there should be no 
nominations at these points.  Thanks.
