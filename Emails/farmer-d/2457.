In an attempt to continue cross training on our desk,  Jackie and Susan will 
be switching duties.
Jackie will start training on Susan's desk and Susan on Jackie's and the 
transition will last most
of March and they will finalize it with April business.  It is important that 
we start communicating the
changes to our customers and make it as smooth as possible on them.  Thanks,  
Pat
