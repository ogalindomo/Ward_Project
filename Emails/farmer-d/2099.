 FYI...ONLY !

 Presently, I have scheduled  a 10.0m buyback at this interconnect due to the 
plant being down and 
 the status is day to day.

 The 10.0m buyback begun Wednesday, April 5th.
 
 Gary, please let me know how you want this interconnect allocated { ie:  
force majeure & allocate total 
 flow to the base ticket ; Sitara # 148390}.
