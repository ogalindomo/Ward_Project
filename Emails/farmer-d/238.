Daren,
Just following up on my email and call last week re: the CPI 
information--just as soon as you can get that to me I will be able to get out 
a revised draft. i know folks are anxious so let me know if there is someone 
else you would like me to ask about this

Thanks for your help,
Sandi

like to see it referenced in the agreement. Is there a specific publication 
that I can reference like I do for HSC proces in the first of the month
