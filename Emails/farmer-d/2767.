FYI .... for Feb00 only, Equistar asked we deliver the gas under Sitara 
106736 to HPL meter 1373 instead (the plant it was originally going to is 
having some maintenance being done in Feb).

While I've already change the delivery point in the Sitara ticket, maybe 
something needs to bve done to the risk assignment .....
