(SeaRobin P/L)


Here is the change to Garden Banks 128 that was effective 6/15/00.  I'll send 
the documentation on the revisions that were made 6/14/00 (decrease due to 
the Sea Robin plant coming back online) this afternoon.

Thanks,
Steve

Thanks.  By the way, I never got any documentation for the GB128 change
effective 6/15.  Could you send something over for my (and Ami's) records?
