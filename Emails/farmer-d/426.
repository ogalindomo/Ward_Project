Vance,

Thank you for the information.  That explains the deal.  What we need now, to 
correctly book these volumes and clear any current issues in Volume 
Management and/or settlements which would date back to the inception of the 
deal.  This will also ensure that your book is correct for this deal.  I 
think that Bob Cotten is the one to correct/add the deal, and then Tom Acton 
and myself will need to make requests of Volume Mgmt. to kick-off the 
re-booking process.

Thank you for your time,

Mary
