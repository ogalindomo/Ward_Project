FYI ---I entered the changes for Tenaska IV & Brazos for the 6th & 7th....I 
made the changes to the Brazos ticket #458433, and the Tenaska IV ticket 
#384258, let me know if you have any questions or if a wrong ticket was 
changed.    Spreadsheet is updated.

Brazos called for the following:

7th 19,735

Still waiting to hear when the plant will be back up.

Thanks,
Mark
