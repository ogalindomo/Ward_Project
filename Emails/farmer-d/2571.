Reminder:
Tomorrow is Brenda's Management Team Offsite Meeting. Thank you for all your 
confirmations.  We would like to take a different approach to this meeting 
soooooo instead of an agenda I am asking that each of you submit a topic that 
you would like have discussed in a RoundTable format at tomorrow's meeting.  
Topics can range from issues the Management Team does well that we can apply 
to other areas, issues where we can improve and do better than we are, places 
where we should challenge the status quo.  I realize that this request is a 
little gray and a little broad so if you have any questions please call 
otherwise please have your topics submitted by the end of today (don't you 
just love short notice requests).  

All of your input is what will make this meeting successful so thank you in 
advance.
