Sharon,

 Can you please increase HPLC's MDQ for contract 5910 from 50,000 MMBTU's to 
100,000 MMBTU's effective December 13, 2000?  I believe Lauri Allen already 
spoke to you regarding this matter.  If any other information is needed 
please contact me at ext. 3-6381 or Lauri Allen at ext. 3-7272.  Thank you 
for your help.
