You have been identified as key SITARA personnel for Term Deals with Risk 
Assignment.  A New SITARA release with a complete redesign of Risk Assignment 
is scheduled to be implemented into production the weekend of Jan 22.

There will be 3 demos of the New SITARA Risk Assignment release on the 
following dates/times in room EB 5C2
Jan 19 - 3:00 - 4:00
Jan 19 - 5:00 - 6:00 
Jan 20 - 4:30 - 5:30 

There are some major changes to SITARA that will result in a transformation 
of every deal with risk assignment.  This release includes the introduction 
of financial deal types needed for SITARA valuation and eventual replacement 
of CPR and TAGG systems for natural gas.
 
Please make every effort to attend one of these sessions.   

You are encouraged to invite anyone you believe may be interested in 
attending.
