I need some assistance getting these deals corrected in the system for the 
weekend, so that I can get my errors clear.  I have tried to change the 
counterparty, but I am not able.  Jackie is out again today, so, I will be 
behind the proverbial 8-ball and would greatly appreciate your help clearing 
these things up.

Deal ticket 468688 P-MGI is in system as HPLC purch.  The correct entity is 
ENA IM Texas, ENA made the orig. Sale
Deal ticket 468110 D2D to deliver to Central desk at Humble is on ENA, These 
tickets have always been HPLC and not ENA.

Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to speed the process.  
I need to have all of my errors clean today.

Thank you,

Mary
