Robert:

I have updated the info at Enron Methanol per gas control's volumes (via 
meter overrides).  I did not realize that's what you wanted when you handed 
me the "sticky" on Monday.....  I thought you were just being informative.

Sorry about the confusion.

Charlotte Hawkins

 This is a follow up to the note I gave you on Monday, 4/3/00 { preliminary  
flow data provided by Daren}.

 Please override POP'S  daily volume{ presently zero}  to reflect  daily 
activity you can obtain from Gas Control.
 
 This change is needed  ASAP for economics purposes.
