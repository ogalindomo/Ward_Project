Ok, it looks like we are going with the no deal situation. I will zero out 
the buyback and the sale for the next 2 weeks. Let me know if you want to 
handle it differently.

I have requested a force majeure letter from Valero and they wanted to know 
what exact language should be in this letter.  Dan, can you give me some 
guidance that I can directly forward to Valero.

The plant went down at 0001 hrs this morning. My information is they moved 
their turnaround up and will be down for as long as 3 weeks. Please let us 
know how the economics should be handled---- buyback, force majure, no deal, 
or what.

Thanks 
Ken
