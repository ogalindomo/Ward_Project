As a precautionary measure because of yesterday's power outage, the hardware 
that Sitara runs on has been rebooted.  Sitara should be available around 
7:30 AM Thursday (06/29).  Once the reboot is complete, all Sitara 
applications should be available.

If you are getting this message and no longer use the Sitara applications, 
please contact the Sitara Hotline (x37049) to have your name removed.
