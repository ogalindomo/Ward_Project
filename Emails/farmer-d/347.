Hey leaders,
?
As you know there will be a combined High  School/Middle School devo this 
coming Sunday evening.? I just got word  today that part of the time will be 
spent doing some service oriented things,  one of which will involve the 
benevolence program.? Let your teens know  tomorrow night at NEON that they 
need to bring a small grocery sack of food with  them on Sunday evening.?
?
Thanks.
