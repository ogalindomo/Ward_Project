Subject: Revised Sea Robin Availabilities effective 6/17/00


Christina,
Per our conversation this afternoon, I have revised the availabilities for 
those meters that have a PVR deduction effective 6/17/00.  I will let you 
know as soon as I hear anything about the Sea Robin plant coming back online.
