I have been asked to coordinate a meeting to review the new Enron Internet 
Site.  I have reserved the video conference room on 41 (4102) from 9:00 am to 
10:00 am on Tueday, June 20.  If you cannot attend, please respond asap so we 
can reschedule if participation is limited.

To review the site before then, go to http://test4.enron.com
