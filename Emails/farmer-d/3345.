Eric, 

Daren suggested that I forward this request to you:

Per my voice mail, attached below, please find a spreadsheet detailing 
locations/delivery points/meter numbers and available volumes for each 
package of gas in the Texas Gulf Coast/WAHA Area.  Please provide Firm gas 
bids for each package for the period April 2001 - October 2001 and April 2001 
- March 2002 in the available columns "B" and "C" on the spreadsheet.  



After completing the spreadsheet, please return to me via e:mail.

Thank you, 
Melissa Graves
