Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price?
