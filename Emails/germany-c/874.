After discussing the CES reconciliation project with commercial, I confirmed 
that manual invoices had been generated for CES business on at least CGAS and 
Atlanta Gas Light (Sonat portion).  Deals initially entered into Sitara on 
the CES acquisition could not be utilized especially on CGAS for invoicing 
purposes.  Thus Unify volumes were not used for these invoices / payments / 
netouts.  P/L reports were instead utilized.  In light of this information, 
there's a good possibility that actual volumes on deliveries, storage 
withdrawals / injections and netouts were not captured accurately in 
Unify/Sitara and so we don't show any receivables out there for CES. 

Our scheduler on CGAS, Joann Collins, has requested archived information from 
CGAS for CES volumes from January - March 2000.  In the interim, as we 
discussed, we should definitely invoice and recieve payment from CES for the 
$$$ they want to pay us.  Afterwards, we'll need to review our historical 
manual invoices and imbalance accounts with CES to see where we actually 
stand .  Any thoughts???  THANKS
