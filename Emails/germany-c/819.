Aug should be 1,089,109, Sep is good and Oct should be 121,013. Apr was 
786,579
while May, Jun & Jul were same as Aug. Your total for 7/31 is OK. Remember
these are theoretical numbers by which you bill CES/NPC. They also don't 
divide
by 30 or 31 so it is hard to make a daily injection add up.

Just double checking my numbers, this is what I now show on COH storage.
Let me know if I need to tweak it and where.
