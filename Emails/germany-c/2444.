Cora Pendergrass has been working with Michcon, along with the CES people, to 
try to resolve the penalty issue.  Michcon has advised us that instead of 
assessing CES the $10-$15 penalty they could conceivably charge, they are 
reducing it to $.25.  Just for your info, the penalty could have been as high 
as $585,000; instead, it ends up being about $10,000.
