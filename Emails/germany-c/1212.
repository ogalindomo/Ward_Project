Still showing up.  Release number 19858-1 is released to CES for July from 
Lilco.  Last time I talked with Lilco, they had to release to CES, not ENA.  
Does the same apply for July?

Is this still there? LILCO said that they did not release to you for June.

Lilco released the Transco Capacity to CES for June.  We still have not 
executed
the capacity.  The volume is 84 dth (offer #19858) and you don't get billed a
demand charge from the pipeline.  I believe Lilco bills CES directly for
participating in the program.

Do you want to execute this capacity?

thanks
