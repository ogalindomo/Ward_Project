All the CPA gas has been and continues to be nominated by Heidi Boyd @ CES 
Retail in Herndon,VA.
There are two deals with Statoil for CPA "Class 90 " (production gas produced 
directly into CPA's system).
 One is for 10,000 Mcf/Month @ NX1 +  $.56 /Mcf.  The other is for 1,500 MCFD 
@ NX1 + $.54 / Mcf.  Both deals expire the end of October 2000.

Subject: Statoil Jan and Feb  

John, just got a phone call from Mark Feldman nad Sherry in Volume Mngt. They 
are wanting us to path some production gas from Statoil behind the CPA gate 
for Jan and Feb. The volumes are 8,946/month and 47,567/month (Deal #244378) 
for Jan, and 10,005/month and 43,500/month (Deal # 142780) for Feb. Do you 
know about this? and who is this gas sold to? (Original CES Retail deal or 
and incremental addition?) Mark is needing this pathed asap, so if you have 
some info let me know. Thanks, Rob
