Attached is the latest version. The retail numbers have been updated. The
transport numbers are currently being cross referenced to the master list John
Hodge has been cleaning up, in order to make sure everything is included. The
pricing was discussed yesterday between an ENA group and myself. I believe a
few minor changes are in order and need to be agreed upon.

Please forward any changes or questions to me. Thanks.
