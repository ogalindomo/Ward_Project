Just got this clarified by Scott G., that this is not a special pricing but
like any other contract. ENA will bill CES for both demand and commodity
charges, ENA is billed by TCO for $0.01 demand and commodity and Aristech pays
TCO the remaining demand.

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.
