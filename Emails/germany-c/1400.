Subject: Capacity question

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?
