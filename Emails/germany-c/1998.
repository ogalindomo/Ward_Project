Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie
