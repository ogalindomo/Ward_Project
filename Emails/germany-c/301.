I need to get from you a detailed list of contracts on TCO that have been 
assigned to ENA from either CES or NPC. Specifically I am looking for RPs, 
DPs and the associated primary volumes. The monthly contract list tracks 
demand charges OK, but is not good enough for pathing gas in Winter. Give me 
a call when you get back to discuss.
