Tco uses a master agreement for the storage's (Contract 51407) and then list
the individual agreements to allocate costs.  Contract 51407 acts as a
balancing agreement to tell you what is available.  There will never be 
charges
on 51497 they will always be on the individual contracts.

I understand that contract 63304 is the retail FSS contract with a total
capacity of 7,503,838.  I bill CES Retail for the demand charges on this.  
What
is FSS contract 51407?
