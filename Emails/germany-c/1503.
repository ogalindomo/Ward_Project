Subject: CPA 4/21


Howdy Folks!!

Hey Joann,

Can you please decrease my nomination to CPA 4-25 starting 4/21?

I am looking to decrease my CES endusers volume by 2,620 dth/day from 4/21 to
4/30 in Op4 Mkt 25.  I am not interested in sending it elsewhere so it will
have to be a sell back.  This will appear in Doug Kinney's next spreadsheet.

Please just let me know which contracts to decrease (38021???)  : )

THANKS!!!
