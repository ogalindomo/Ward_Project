TCO decided to reverse the penalties Enron incurred in January and February. 
The credit is on the TCO's invoice for April.

January = $13,424
February = $13,775

Total Credit = $27,199

TCO Team discussed this penalty situation with TCO's VP, Marsall Lang. TCO 
decided that Enron had not abused the system and did not overrun the TFE 
(Total Firm Entitlement). YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
