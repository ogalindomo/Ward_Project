Chris,
 Just to confirm with you about activity with Egan Hub, there was nothing for 
September production, however there was a park and loan deal for October.  If 
this is correct, could you please forward you spreadsheet with the details?  
I have not received anything from Egan confirming this or billing me for any 
fees associated with this deal.   Also, just to let you be aware of the 
imbalance left on the other storage activity that was bought from Columbia; 
we had an ending imbalance of 101 mmbtu due ENA.  If you need a copy of the 
Egan statement with this, please let me know, so I can forward a copy to you 
or whomever may need it.

Thanks,
Marlo
