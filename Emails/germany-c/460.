This 250R/245D should be part of our daily demand for COH 8-35from ENA, not 
in addition to. 
ie 750/d demand = 245(AGG POOL) + 505( sto+ IPP)
Also please pull directly from Agg Pool to transport K, ( not through IPP 
Pool ) as it may get cut

I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New 
Power).  I will price both deals using the FOM index pricing.
