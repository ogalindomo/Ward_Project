We received verbal confirmation of the X-56 OFO waiver from DTI.  The 
following points are alternate (secondary) delivery points to Transco Leidy 
for contract .3924;

Iroquois @ Canajoharie, Empire @ Lysanda, TGP @ Sabinsville, TETCO @ Leidy, 
TGP @ Morrisville and  TGP @ Ellisburg

I will forward the written confirmation to Steve Gillespie, I should get that 
in the next few days.
The indications from DTI are for the X-56 and Valley Gate restrictions to be 
imposed mid month (November), however if the mild weather in the NE persists 
it may get pushed towards the end of the month.
Let me know if you have any questions.
