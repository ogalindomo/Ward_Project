I'm off to Paris tomorrow until the 29th.  Please feel free to call Greg 
Maliken in my absence 716-857- 7634 and check the website for daily 
postings.  I can't promise that this email will be daily.

I have 10,000 dth available for ISS on the east side of my system and 25,000 
available at Colden (which requires Tenn Zone 5 capacity).  I'm not sure what 
the weekend is looking like but Greg should be able to tell you tomorrow 
morning.

Transportation paths are open and I can move 100,000 dth on my Niagara to 
Leidy line today, tomorrow, into the foreseeable future!

Advance is available, you're guess is as good as mine with the daily pricing 
lately.  Merrill Lynch is forecasting electric demand price spikes this 
summer , while Salomon Smith Barney sees near time pricing "subsiding."

Au revoir,
Abigail
