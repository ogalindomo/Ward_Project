Chris--Have you given us daily swing pricing for June?   The latest 
information
that I had was for May (below).

Thanks.

Subject: Re: Monthly Pricing



Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last month's
pricing.

TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change
Tenn Z6
And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.

I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up 
pricing
to take care of it.
