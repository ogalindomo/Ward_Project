Jeff- I am releasing the Boston Capacity on Algonquin to Energy Express as
we speak.  However, they are not a viable entity on CNG.  Can you provide
the following information on Energy Express?

Name
Phone
Fax
Legal Entity by Pipe

Thanks,
Scott

It's possible BUG, ConEd and Lilco may release capacity to you for June. If
so
let me know. Please release Boston gas capacity to "Energy Express" and let
me
