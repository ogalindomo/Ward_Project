Real forcast on 12/31 AM.

 We have bought 14,824 at PEPL/Maumee (A3) from EES on K#1300, to be used 
where "Toledo Agg" is noted. Per TCO, we should be fine on all those noms.

We have also bought 1,285 from EES at A06 on K#53858 for COH 8-35 and 8-39. 
This 1,285 includes the 250 we have been buying for Nov & Dec, but is in 
addition to the 1,089 for CPA. So total from EES at A06 for CPA/COH for Jan; 
2,374/d.
