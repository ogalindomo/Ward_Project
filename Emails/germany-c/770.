fyi....this is how EnronOnline deals with non-performance issues will be 
handled (see below).
Please discuss with your traders/desk heads, as Bob Superty suggested, to 
ensure there aren't any issues with this.
Thanks for your cooperation.

Subject: Re: Sitara Deal 377626

Please read Jennifer's note below and let me know how you are currently 
dealing with EOL deals that have flow outside the original range of the deal. 
The way the Central desk is handling it is the way we want to across all 
desks. Basically, the original Sitara deal is adjusted to add the additional 
day/days that are agreed to by the traders and the counterparty to meet the 
full commitment and comments need to be added to reflect the same. 

Jennifer, I suggest letting all involved know that this is the way these will 
be handled (traders, desk heads, risk etc.) to ensure the consistency you 
mention is achieved. As you can see I'm only reaching a limited audience.

George, thanks for your explanation.

I reviewed the transaction in EnronOnline (#385131) & Sitara (#377626) and 
found similar treatment in the following deals for the month of August on the 
Central Desk.

Sitara #   EOL#
-----------   -------------
365957   363168
366026   363271
377650   385194 
369869   370402

I agree with the way George & his group are handling these non-performance 
and payback transactions as far as keeping them 
"connected". However, I think it is beneficial to put comments in Sitara as 
to what is happenning. As we know,  all EnronOnline deals are FIRM. If trader 
agees how to handle this on the phone, it is recorded plus it is documented 
in Sitara. I think this is a good audit trail and good record-keeping.  

Everyday, Elizabeth is doing a reconciliation that identifies any changes to 
EnronOnline transactions. If she read the comments
documenting as above, this "alarm" would be eliminated. 

Since we have not seen this on other desks, I wonder how they are handling 
non-performances. I think there should consistency
in the downstream systems. Bob, can you find out how East, West, and Texas do 
this?   

Thanks for your help.
Jennifer

These deals are not being "retraded". These are instances where the 
counterparty has not performed and trading has made the decision to allow 
payback.
The only way we have to schedule that payback is to add an additional day to 
the deal. We could create a new ticket but I think this would create a 
"disconnect" between the EOL deal and the payback deal. I would appreciate 
your thoughts as to how we handle this in future.
