That means we need roughly 8000 dkths/d  of Ag gas or Broad Run gas to cover 
markets. Right now we have enough Ag03 production  around 20000/day to cover 
markets.  THANKS

Subject: FYI


	

PER THE CES SUPPLY DEALTICKET THE VA POWER & CORAL BROADRUN GAS EXPIRES ON 
3/31/2000.
THAT MEANS THE PRIMARY CONTRACTS TO SUPPLY RESTRICTED MARKETS WILL BE 
SECONDARY AND SUBJECT TO CUT.  I WILL EITHER NEED MORE AO3/W. VIRGINIA OR 
BROADRUN GAS TO KEEP IT PRIMARY.



THANKS
JOANN
