TCO will allow this burn rate until further notice for Hopewell. This 
information has been give to Chuck Barnes at Hopewell Plant and to Cullen 
Harper. 

12 midnight to 10 am = 1200 dkt /hour 10 x 1200  = 12,000
10 am to 12 noon = 2500 dkt/hour 2 x 2500  = 5,000
12 noon to midnight = 3500 dkt/hour 12 x 3500  = 42,000

Total Burn      = 59,000

Note, this is max that hopewell can do... not what they have ordered for each 
day. 

Now we need to find gas and transport to get it there.

Thanks.
