Here is the letter and an attachment that you will need to complete to move 
the CNG meters from the CES' pools to ENA's pools.  There are some 
highlighted notes that I put on the letter that tells you what you need to 
do.    You will probably just want to attach a spreadsheet list of the meters 
that you are moving for each letter.  The list will need to include the 
producer information also.  You will need to do one of these letters for all 
the agg point pools.  I filled out everything for you on the attachment all 
you need to do is make sure you attach the appropriate list of meters.

Please call me if you have any questions.  (614) 718-6340



Thanks,
Heidi
