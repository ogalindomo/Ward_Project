Hi everyone!!

I made it and my bags finally showed up... almost had to do a shopping trip.

My apartment is right across from the office and is very nice. Maryland is
beautiful and the weather is great... nice and cool... in the 60/70's! I
need my sweaters already.... who would have thought.

TCO (the pipeline I scheduled) is taking us to the Orioles game Friday.

Please note my e-mail has changed slightly... I know... I said it wouldn't.
Gen changed to neg. Neg is for National Energy Group. It was gen for US
Generating.
