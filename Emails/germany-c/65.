Joanne- do you have any upstream contracts for CVA or CMD?

As for CPA, we have bought 3,942 at Broadrun Cobb from East Ohio Gas K#34826. 
We will buy 2,821(FOM) from you at the pool plus we plan to  buy  6,061 at 
A06. Nothing at A05 for Mar01.

So of the 15,553 FOM gas (Ex1 plus hedges @ CG) we will use 2,759 CPA, 1,200 
CVA and 472 CMD. The remaining 11,122 (or 11,370 @ pool) will be pulled into 
NPC App Pool from ENA App Pool. 

I will let you know A06 assoonasigetit.
