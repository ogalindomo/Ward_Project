Based on the Atlanta requirements for 3/1/00, I have summarized below the
volumes I anticipate flowing on the 1st, assuming Enron elects to continue
basing ETNG, then Transco, and finally Sonat:


IBSS  13,802

ETNG    4,083

Transco  5,332

Sonat/SGNG  3,941


I spoke with Phil Villagomez and got the ETNG contract # ... now I just need
the Transco contract #'s and associated volumes.

Thanks,

David
