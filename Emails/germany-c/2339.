Here is a revised draft of an Agreement to finalize the retail issues.  It is 
marked to show changes from the previous draft.  Please note that I did not 
include Ed's comments regarding a true-up in light of the mechanism Colleen 
proposed.

Your thoughts and comments will be appreciated.  I look forward to hearing 
from you.
