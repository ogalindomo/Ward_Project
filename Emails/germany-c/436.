Please see the latest versions of the EOL documents covering transportation.  
We have made several changes since I gave you all copies this morning.  
Please forward any comments to me and Gerald Nemec by the END OF THE DAY 
TODAY so we can keep on schedule for testing.   Thanks for your cooperation.
