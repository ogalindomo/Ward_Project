Dayton Power is away from the office on Friday and Monday for the new year
holiday.  They have requested nominations for the 1st to the 4th by 2:00 
today.

The first day of January is the most critical.  I will have the ability to
adjust any of the days from my home over the weekend on an intraday basis.

I will need to work with Joann and Joni (Tco schedulers) to get the 
nominations
in place.

I'll call you, Chris, after morning trading to devise a game plan for the 1st.

If Joann works here today, I'm going to need to stay close by.
