Subject: Opt 60 for 2/4

the OPT 60 contract has been restricted again for 2/4.  I spoke with TCO and 
they explained that the notice was posted late (11:15am) due some internal 
issue at TCO.  I normally check the notices early am and then again once 
nominations has be scheduled. 
wges  was=7314 now=0
hopewell was=25500 now=0
cgv1  was=209 now=0

I will need Emporia/Transco to deliver to Hopewell and any markets in oper 1.


thanks
joann
