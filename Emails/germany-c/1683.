The January check just arrived at Chantilly. Kathy is fedexing it directly to
Cash Management for morning delivery.  The late receipt is due to the fact 
that
it was addressed to the old Fairfax office and not to the Irvine CA address
requested on the invoice.   I just spoke to Robin Barbe (who checked with 
their
accounting staff) and understand that Enron feels that the effort to stop the
check, and immediately execute a wire transfer would not be productive.
Regards,
Roman

Subject:  January OPT 60 Payment

Joan,

CALP has received the wire transfer payment for the month of February (thank
you).  However, January's check , which was mailed on March 24th, has still 
not
arrived.  I have to make both a debt payment and a partner distribution on
Monday, April 3rd. Since the partners only receive distributions twice a year,
it would be helpful if CALP received Januarys payment.  Could Enron put a stop
payment on January's check and have the funds wire transferred to CALP's 
account
tomorrow?  Anything you could do would be helpful.

Thanks!

Paulette
