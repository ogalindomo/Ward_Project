I created deal  225281 for Leonard Hall for the Nov99 gas in February. 
The meters are not in Global Facilities, so I set it up on the general 
IMB-508674 point for now.

Robert, can you take it from here to get it pathed (or corrected) ?  Let me 
know when completed and I will draft a payment.

Thanks  WRP
