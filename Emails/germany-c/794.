Attached is a modified version of the Daily Changes spreadsheet you've been 
receiving from Doug Kinney.  The new format shows the required volume by date 
and by meter ... same as before ... but now compares that "new" volume to the 
original FOM volume for each day of the month, as opposed to comparing it to 
the previous days requested volume.  Let me know if you have any thoughts / 
comments about this format.

Again, if you don't want on the distribution ... or know of someone I should 
add ... please let me know.

To date, the only changes for September have been behind AGL, and those 
changes are included on the attachment.
