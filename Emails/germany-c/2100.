I think Hedi and John Singer spoke about this.  John left today and I didn't 
get
a final account of what happened.  Would you check with Hedi?

Chris,

We have been shorted by Beldon & Blake, 6400 dths of production gas so far for
February at National Fuel Gas.  My understanding is that they had a problem
with the pipeline interconnection and could not deliver.  Enron currently 
holds
the contract with Beldon & Blake for the production.  Unless they are under a
force majuere, they should be delivering this gas.  Please let me know whether
or not we will be able to make up this gas for the month.


Per our conversation, we are also receiving local production gas behind NYSEG
and CPA.  On CPA we receive gas from Power Gas, Phillips, CNG Field Services,
and Stat Oil.

Thanks,

Brian
