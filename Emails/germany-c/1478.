FYI--
The Allied Signal deal has been changed to a CES-Retail transaction, for 
which Chris Germany should be verifying all pricing.

The PennFuel deals are entered incorrectly for the remaining term at a TCO 
pool index, but it appears that Steve Gillespie is updating the pricing 
monthly to accurately reflect the correct basis pricing plus variable cost of 
transporation to the gate.

The Boonville pricing has been corrected to reflect NYX plus $.45 instead of 
TCO pool index for the remaining term of the deal.
