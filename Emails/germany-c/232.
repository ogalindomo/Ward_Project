Alain and John,
I understand you are both planning on attending the DTI Appalachian Pool 
Operators meeting in Clarksburg next week.  We are not planning to send 
anyone to cover the meeting, therefore could you please provide us with a 
summary of the meeting and forward copies of any pertinent information?
Thanks for your help.
Sean
