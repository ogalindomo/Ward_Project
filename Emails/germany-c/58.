 Hello KSBJ Volunteers!

      If you surf the net, we need your help. Our ticketing department is
trying to compile a list of ticketing websites. We need the following type
of websites...
1. Christian Ticketing Companies
2. Houston Area Ticketing Companies(Please check to make sure that they are
a legitimate company and not scalpers)
3. Internet Ticketing Companies

Also if you would like to volunteer for the Third Day Concert on March 3,
2001 at Sugar Creek Baptist Church, please let me know ASAP. We need prayer
volunteers, merchandise volunteers and Security Volunteers.

We are also in need of 2 volunteers for the upcoming brown bag concert with
Nicole Nordeman this Tuesday February 6, 2001 at Baybrook Mall and
Wednesday, February 7, 2001 at Willowbrook Mall from 10am-1pm.

We are about to start an 8 week project which starts on February 12, 2001.
We are in need of volunteers who are good communicators, have a great
personality and are able to come to the station for 3 hrs once a week or
every other week. (We are flexible) The available time slots are 9am-noon,
1pm-3pm, 3pm-6pm, 6pm-9pm
