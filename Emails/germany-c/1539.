I was wondering if this would work:  

Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on 
spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process.  

Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty 
(like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of 
what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a 
credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry 
and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?

For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to ENA 
at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the 
commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:
 1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10, 
Counterparty = Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline
 2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10, 
Counterparty = Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd

It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of 
this transport p&l.  
Please advise.
