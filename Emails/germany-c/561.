Crystal,

I know that you have already set up the TAGG deals, I just wanted to be sure 
that you had all of the information.

We are able to park up to 300,000 over the month of October.  The gas is to 
be returned to us in January 2001.  The fee is .04 per MMBtu, but it will be 
negotiable on a daily basis.  This will be billed prorata from October to 
January.  The volumes can also flluctuate daily.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
