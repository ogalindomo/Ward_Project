Chris- I think John replied to this.  In addition, Enron can use the TCO
storage in any manner you choose.

Subject: Storage Questions



I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?


2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??






thanks
