We agreed to a capacity release deal with Tim Landstrom at Indeck Silver 
Springs.  Indeck will release non-recallable capacity to ENA for $0.10/dt.

 Term:  December 1-31, 2000
 Receipt: Hastings Agg
 Delivery: Silver Springs facility (North citygate)
 Rate:  $0.10 demand
 Volume: 9,549 dt delivered (9,772 @ SP)

According to Tim, he's never had problems taking this to any north citygates 
except NIMO East.  But, it is secondary.  Mr. Goodell has volunteered to 
handle the release, but I wanted you to know about it.  We also bought 9,772 
dt at South Point for December.
