To ensure we are all on the same page, this is the order to fill Choice for 
high burn days:

67693 =  54327  (note... we have some CES EU on this contract... about 1000 
to 1500 dkt)

67829 = 8527 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67831 = 3473 (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

67830 = 3000  (Aristech's capacity, seq 1 = coh 7-1 and seq 2 = coh 7-5)

IDLE FTS = ask Joann. We have been using 66930 = 4000  and 66931 = 4000.

Calp/ITS =  Do a double nom. If Calp comes up, you can 0 out Calp and still 
use IT. If Calp does not come up, then 0 out IT. Make sure Kara does the 
double nom also. COH does not tie-out forecast to gain plus nominations, per 
Kara.
