Subject: TCO capacity available

Attached is a list of Columbia Gas capacity that posted on the EBB.  All bids 
are due 3/15 at 9am.  
Let me know what you see value in and what our game plan is.  If ENA doesn't 
want it should we mention it to CES?

Robert, Joann and Joni - was CES short this winter at any of these points?

Scott
