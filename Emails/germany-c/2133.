Some LDC tariffs are available through the state PUC web sites, but not 
many.  If you're looking for particular LDC's, I can get you the PUC web 
sites.

Also, you might check with Paul Tate in EES (handles east region logistics).  
EES used to have some kind of data base into which they were loading the LDC 
tariffs, but I could never get into it.  I think it was called E-file or 
something like that.  Since they sold off the group that was developing it, 
it may not be available to us anymore.

(Let me know what you find out.)

Do we have a website with LDC tariff's that you are aware of?
