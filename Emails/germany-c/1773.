Heidi,

 Per Jim Kuhn @ Belden & Blake, the volumes contracted for for NYSEG 
production are as follows:
 APR = 216 DTH/Day
 MAY = 179 DTH/Day
 JUN = 160 DTH/Day
 JUL = 192 DTH/Day
 AUG = 195 DTH/Day
 SEP = 191 DTH/Day
 OCT = 190 DTH/Day

Does CES need these volumes??

BBC has additional volumes for sale for the period Apr/Sep.  They are trying 
to seel the gas for the entire period vx monthly.  If you have an idea what 
volumes you need monthly for Apr/Oct, I will try to purchase from BBC.
