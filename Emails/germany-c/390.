I want to check if we are on the same page for storage WD for Nov00. Through 
11/14 Actuals, I show we have WD 208,862 dth from storage, or 204,300 
adjusted for TCO Fuel at the CG. Could you please let me know where you are 
at? 
Per the Proxy, we are targeting WD of 907,591@sto, or 887,769 @ CG, (+/- 5%) 
for the EOM. Let me know. jpp
