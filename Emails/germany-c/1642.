Ideally, a copy to both people would be best.  If that's too cumbersome, then
send the copies to Charlie and we'll get separate copies to Don.

Thanks.

Subject: Transport Invoices



Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday.  
He
is requesting copies of the transport invoices.  Should I give the invoices to
him or should I send them to Charlie?
