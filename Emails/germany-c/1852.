ENA pays 89.17% of the demand  and commodity charges and 100% of the fuel.  
Now we pay the pipelines 100% and Boston Gas reimburses us the difference.  
Our Canadian producer group is charged the whole 89.17% of the transportation 
charges and all of the fuel in their netback pricing.

Hope this answers your question...

This is just for my information.  We want to make sure the proper parties are 
listed oon our demand reimbursement worksheet..
