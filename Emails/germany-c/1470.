Per John Whited, Effective May 1st, 2000:

Aristech will be managed by Strategic Energy (Hans Rottman.... former CES 
employee... who originally got this account).

Enron will no longer do the agency nominations for Aristech.

Jesse/Cindy/John; please check if the term supply deal from Columbia Gulf for 
Aristech goes  past April 30, 2000.

Scott/Chris/Jeff/John; please determine how you want to handle the release of 
Aristech's transport to CES in May 2000.

Special Note:
This concludes all agency deals that Enron TCO staff was scheduling for CES. 
There are no more agency deals.
