We are trying to schedule this gas for today.  Joann, you are getting 245 
dt's from Reyna off ANR.  I created a sale to CES (deal 160410) at a price of 
$3.75.

Brian, I made need to adjust this price.  It won't be much of an adjustment 
and we can talk about that later.

Per my discussion with Joann, it looks like we have covered this 240 dth at 
meter 80-03 on CGAS.
