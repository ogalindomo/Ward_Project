Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty 
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract 
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l 
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by 
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market 
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract 
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it 
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets.  

Any thoughts ?
