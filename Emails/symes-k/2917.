Kate, 

I just spoke to DeeDee of Pinnacle West, we verballed deals and she said all 
deals should be under the Pinnacle West name unless for Bloomberg 
transactions.   Please review the following 

Mark Fischer
563906.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West
563907.01  non brokered > cp name should be Pinnacle West

562226.01  Bloomberg, cp name should be Arizona Public Service.  (Evelyn 
inquired about this yesterday)

Thanks for your help!
Stephanie
