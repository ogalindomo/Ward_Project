Hey Kate,

   Hope work is going alright this afternoon.  Don't look out the window, it 
kind of got nice out.  I think we are all going to be downtown this 
afternoon, so call one of us to meet up if you want.  I'm enclosing my 
resume, see what you can do.  I would really appreciate any help you could 
give me.

Thanks,
chase
