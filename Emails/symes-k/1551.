To all:

I ran a minibook valuing the Merced correction (as of yesterday's curves), 
and confirmed that the LTNW book will lose approximately $6.8MM in value 
after the calc today.  This reverses the $7MM gain that was incorrectly shown 
in the LTNW book on yesterday's DPR.  Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Thanks,
Monica
