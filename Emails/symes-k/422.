The attachment below shows the West Power Trading Administrative team and 
describes primary areas of responsibility.  The team is anxious to learn more 
about Enron and how to support your needs, so please don't hesitate to 
provide feedback on how to improve our level of service to you.  Your 
patience is appreciated during the training phases for our new employees. 

From today forward, please go to your designated assistant, as described in 
the attachment, for your administrative requests.  As always, if you need 
immediate help and your assistant is not available, please see me or another 
member of our administrative team for assistance.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
