I didn't see your name on the list - do you have direct deposit or was it a 
check?

My paycheck doesn't seem to be anywhere around here. Could you let me know if 
my name was on the list of missing paychecks for the end of last month? Kathy 
Axford said she gave you such a list on 12/30. 

Thanks,
Kate
