This deal with Colorado River Commission is for calendar 2002.  We were told 
that we may need to enter special CAISO language for deals that extent past 
April 2002, but that the traders should be entering comments to indicate 
this.  Does Mike want us to include this language in the confirm letter for 
this deal?
Thanks for your help!
