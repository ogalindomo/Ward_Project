They just had it as 12/5/00 in the system and with the deal being done 
direct, it is tough to have proof from my end when the deal was done.   Is 
this okay?  We just ensure the trade dates match up so it will ease the end 
of month check out, to make sure there was not more then one deal out there 
that it could be confused with.  But the deal on our end was done on 12/6/00 
correct?
thanks

Thanks for keeping me up to date. Out of curiosity, do you know why El Paso 
changed the trade date in the first place?

Kate, 
just fyi, El Paso struck thru our 12/6/00 trade date and placed 12/5/00.  I 
spoke to Chi, of El Paso and he said the 12/6/00 was okay.  I just made a 
note on the confirm and sending it to the fileroom to be executed.
Thanks
Stephanie
