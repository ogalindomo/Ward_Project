Wednesday, April 11 at 10 a.m. Houston time, join Gene Lockhart, president & 
CEO of The NewPower Company on eSpeak.  Gene will answer your questions about 
electric restructuring in Texas.
Can't make it then?  Not to worry:  You can submit a question right now!  Go 
to the eSpeak site and post your question in Gene's event.  He will respond 
to it during the live event, and you can read the transcript later for all 
the answers.


Here is an eMeet game that everyone can play!  Suppose your group is under an 
evil spell cast by a witch.  Who is the witch, what is the spell and what 
words were uttered to cast it?  Sound absurd?  It really isn't.  Going 
through this thought process might help you "exorcise" problems in the 
workplace.  Share your evil spells on eMeet in the "What's your evil spell?" 
category.


By now, most of you have gotten the message that it's time to cut costs at 
Enron.  Do you have a simple suggestion for how we might do this?  Post it in 
the Idea Vault in the new category:  Cost Reduction.  ThinkBank.  Make a
