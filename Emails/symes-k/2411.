Just a few notes on scheduling:

The new VESTAL_6_WDFIRE unit's counterparty name is SierraPower.  This was 
being scheduled as Vestal but the counterparty name has been changed.

Also, there have been a few errors in scheduling the Wheelabrator units.  
They should be scheduled as follows:

Wheelabrat:  MARTEL_2_AMFOR
WheelSHAST:  WSENGY_1_UNIT 4

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,
