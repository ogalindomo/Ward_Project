I left a note for Jeff last night, and apparently he already changed the 
deals to reflect APB's price 
554905 is $350
554912 is $325

I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers 
around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a 
discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.

Thanks,
Kate
