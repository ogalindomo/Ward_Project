Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that 
Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, 
who entered the deal with Valley Electric.

Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake.

Thanks, 
Kate

These two deals were input as not to be confirmed.  They look like they 
should be confimed to me.  If they do not need to be confirmed, please put 
the reason in the comments in deal entry.  Otherwise, please change to be 
confirmed and let me know.

Thanks!
