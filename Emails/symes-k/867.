Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.44)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.



Here are the changes to focus on:

External Exchange fields (Houston Street and True Quote) are now activated.  
(Data can be entered for these fields.)   
Heat Rate Swap deals now display the View Actuals tab for both physical and 
financial deals.  However, only physical deals can be routed.


Please test the application and let me know (by way of email or phone call) 
if Deal Entry is working well, and can be migrated to Production.  We are 
hoping to release it to Prod by tomorrow morning, (December 29, 2000).


Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.
