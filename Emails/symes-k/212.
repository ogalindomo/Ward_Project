Sorry Sharon. I just entered this deal for Matt Motley, and my deal entry 
defaults to all days. This is a peak deal and should only flow Monday through 
Saturday, hours 7-22. It's been changed to reflect that.

Thanks,
Kate

Deal # 460860 is entered as flowing every day of the week.  Is this correct?
