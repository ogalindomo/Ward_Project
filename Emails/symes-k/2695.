    All ext tables should be deleted by triggers ( Enpower-PWR#401 )
    Tantra said the triggers are in TESTN, I can not see them because of my
    permissions. I can trace the problem if I get more info which is the 
database
    instance and what is the error message.

      Thanks,
      Kroum

Subject: Deleting FSP Strips 

Kroum,

Users are having difficulty deleting term strips in Deal Entry due to the 
existence of deal_strip_setlmt_ext records.  Is Deal Entry supposed to delete 
these records explicitly or are we supposed to have a trigger in place to 
handle this?

Thanks,
Will
