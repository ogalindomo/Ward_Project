Hello everyone,

Sometimes it is necessary to figure out how certain costs can be distributed 
evenly and fairly among our groups here at the Portland West Desk.  Below you 
will find an attachment that will automatically calculate the percentage 
breakdown for each group, after entering the total amount in the space 
provided.  The cell above "enter bill total here" is the sum of the column to 
its left.  It should equal the bill total.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,
Anna
