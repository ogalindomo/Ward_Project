I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the 
deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of 
Oakland. Also, the contact is still Wing Lau @ 510-627-1457. I'll change it 
when Risk is done with the calc.

Thanks,
Kate

Sorry.  I guess it's time to bring out the glasses.  The number is 576228.  

Thanks!

Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we 
will need a counterparty contact.

Thanks!
