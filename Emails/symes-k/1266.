This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks!
