I need to change this deal before friday at 5:00.  I know you are very busy 
but we will be doing the March settlements this weekend and I need to have 
all contracts assigned.  Thanks for your help.

Please see if this is Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy or should it be 
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing.  Thanks.
