Kate,

No we don't need to confirm those deals they are to replace deals entered by 
Real Time incorrectly.

I am having to go back and change a number of deals from Oct., Nov. and Dec.

For Oct. I need the following deals for Oct. approved and scheduled.

10/7 563994, 10/11 564001, 10/12 564002, 10/13 564004, 10/17 564007, 10/18 
564012,  10/19 564015, 10/20 564016, 10/22 564017, 10/23 564018,  10/30 
564019, 10/31 564024.

Thanks,

Les
