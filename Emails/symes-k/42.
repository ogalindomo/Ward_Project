Due to popular demand, an Excel worksheet has been created in the famous 
Phonelist workbook (thanks Teri and Lisa!).  When you update the Cost Center 
list, the numbers on the Cost Distribution tab will automatically update.  
This further reinforces the importance of keeping that Cost Center list 
current.

If you have any other ideas or suggestions to add, all the better!

Thanks for your patience,
Anna
