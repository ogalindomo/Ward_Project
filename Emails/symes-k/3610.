To Everyone,

The following are revisions to the final report for April 2001.  I am 
providing details here, and the updated report is also attached.  

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with 
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation 
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and 
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-"Upper Great 
Plain" record, CP ID 81177, will be corrected to read "Western Area Power 
Administration-"Upper Great Plains Region".  The record that was overlayed 
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.  
These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have 
been made in GCP today.  These are branch locations by geographic area of the 
US Dept. of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.

I have also just received a name correction that may as well be included in 
this report -
      From Greer Comm. of Public Works, CP ID 36393, to Commission of Public 
Works, City of Greer




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
