As noted on the email I sent to you on November 16 on the subject of PRC 
Deadlines and Meetings, I wanted to remind you that your Goals for 2001 
document is due to your manager by Monday, December 11.  

The goals should be a mixture of short-term and long-term goals.  For 
example, a short-term goal could be to learn more about the functionality of 
Enpower, while a long-term goal could be to move to the European office to 
manage logistics.  It is important for management to know employee goals so 
that management can help the employee get to where they want to go.

If you have any questions, ask your manager or me.
