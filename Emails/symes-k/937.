Good morning,
We have a note out on the proposed decision on PG&E Corp. and Edison 
International.

? On January 3, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on the purchased power 
undercollection emergency at PG&E Corp. and Edison International. A final 
decision will be issued on January 4.

? The proposal contains interim rate increases of 7%-15% for different 
customer classes. The surcharges would be subject to refunds and 
substantially lower than the 26% and 30% increases requested by PG&E Corp. 
and Edison International, respectively.

? The proposed rate increases would be effective for 90 days. During this 
time the CPUC would consider a more comprehensive audit of the utilities' 
financial condition.

? Significantly, the proposal rejects the utilities' request to end the rate 
freeze. The order would also order the utilities to credit TCBA 
overcollection to the TRA undercollection balance.

? Clearly, the risk of insolvency is much higher now. If passed, the order 
will fall far short of resolving the financial crisis facing PG&E Corp. and 
Edison International. Even if the utilities avoid bankruptcy, we now 
anticipate, more than ever, a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning the 
economic value of these stocks.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
Regards,
