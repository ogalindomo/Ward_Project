Hi Kate,
A few quesions about this one.  Why is it no confirm?  Why is it entered so 
funny (instead of just entering off-peak hours, it was entered strip by strip 
for sundays, which makes it come over really strange on the confirm.) It's 
not necessarily wrong, but whoever entered it needs to know that there's a 
much easier way to enter off-peak deals.  And finally, who is the contact?
Thanks so much for your help!  Hope you had a great weekend!
Kim
