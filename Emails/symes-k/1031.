		 Subject: I have send emergency request request for PWRPROD1

All,

As requested, I have schedulled 10 minutes downtime for PWRPROD1 tonight from 
10:00pm until 10:10pm.

The purpose is to increase the maximum number of processes from 500 into 800.

In the last 1 week, the max number of processes was exceeded twice, so we 
need to resolve this problem as soon as possible.

Please forward this information to anyone who should be notified.

Thank you.

Tantra.
