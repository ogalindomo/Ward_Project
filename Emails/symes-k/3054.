Kate, thanks for looking into it as always!   Harry Gaines's number at Sempra 
is 203-355-5623
I could call either way, just let me know!
Thanks

Leaf finished his shift at 6 a.m. today - he'll be back at 6 p.m. But I 
talked to Bill Williams about it and he saw the trade in the Real Time log, 
and said he remembers hearing Leaf do the trade with Sempra. If you have a 
number for Harry at Sempra, I'd be glad to give him a call and figure this 
out. Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
Deal 567990.01, trader at Sempra, does not show this trade.   Harry from the 
backoffice called. 
Please ask Leaf.

Thanks
Stephanie
