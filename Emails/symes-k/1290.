There were quite a few changes made yesterday.  Please see the attached 
notification report for the summary and detail.

IT TAGG - Please note that short name changes will come from the Jan 2001 
report AND Feb 2001 report.  I will begin making the changes tomorrow at 10:a 
as usual.

The font and page size for this report has been reduced but feel free to 
change the page set up as needed.  The reason the report is set up on A4 
paper is that A4 prints automatically anywhere in the world.  Legal paper 
isn't readily available everywhere, so this format is the best compromise.
