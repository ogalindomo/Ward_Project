Diana just heard back from Prebon. They had it wrong, and have now fixed it. 
There is no deal. Let me know if you don't see this change in the next few 
minutes.

Thanks,
Kate

Sean and Diana do not recognize this deal. They tried to check with the 
brokers, but couldn't get a hold of anyone. I'll let you know first thing in 
the morning whether or not this is good and what the deal number is.
