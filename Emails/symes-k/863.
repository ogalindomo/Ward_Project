As some of you know, I am leaving Enron and heading to Wyoming for a five 
month ski trip across Greater Yellowstone this winter.  The trip is going to 
be on MountainZone.com, a web site that follows outdoor expeditions.  After 
each part of our trip, we will send in pictures and written updates.  Here is 
the address:

My email after leaving Enron will be: wgoodbody@hotmail.com

It's been a lot of fun working with everyone here.  All the best in 2001!

Regards,

Winston
