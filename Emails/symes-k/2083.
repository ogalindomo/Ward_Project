I have a question about how this deal is entered.  You have it entered as 
every day of the week including Sundays and Holidays for the hours 7 -22.  I 
think that will duplicate the off peak hours you have entered for Sundays on 
#533134.  It is already flowing Sundays, 24 hours on #533134.  Is this in 
addition to those hours or is it a duplication?

Also, do you want these two confirmed on one letter or as two separate 
deals.  If together, please put a note in the comment section of deal entry 
sp we will know to confirm both on one letter.

Thanks!
