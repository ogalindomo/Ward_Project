This is the preliminary report for December 2000.  Fortunately, you have seen 
most of the information during the month because the overlays on name changes 
were reported as they occurred.  The additions, that were not previously 
reported, are highlighted.





The ERMS short name changes will be made on Monday, December 18, after 1:p, 
CST.  Please note that the short name for American Public Energy Agency, CP 
ID 51134, will also be changed as indicated.  This was a name overlay on the 
Nov. 2000 report (see bottom tab on the spreadsheet).   It will change from 
ENERGYAME to AMERPUBENE.

Records will be inactivated on Jan 1, 2001.



HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
