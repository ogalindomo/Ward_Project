This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
killing it now.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate can you ask Phil Platter is Dane Energy Corp the correct broker on this 
deal?

Thanks
