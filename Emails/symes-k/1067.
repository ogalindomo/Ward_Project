Subject: New email address

Hey Mom!
Just wanted to give you my new email address!  Job is going well, I'll tell
you all about it when I have more time.  Also, new address is 515 Clarkson
#207, Denver 80218.  I'll let you know when I get my phone.  Apartment is
funky but big, good price, neat location.  Can you give me Kate's email
address?  Can't seem to find it.  Anyway, let me know when you get this so I
know it's working.  Hope all's well in Portland.  It has been gorgeously
sunny everyday here - snow on saturday!!  Also, I have a couple interviews
(one with Starbucks - whatever, it pays the bills!).  But if you can
possibly contribute to the something-for-me-to-sleep-on fund I would
appreciate it so much, as I am moving into my apartment on Monday and will
be bedless until my first paycheck.  Okay, tell everyone I said hi and that
I wish you were all here!  Love, Anna
