I just had a brief talk with Tim Belden, and he likes just seeing the sale 
side, so I think we are OK with the report as it stands.

Thank you for your quick response to my questions, and I will hold on to this 
e-mail so that if I need to have a change in this report, I will be able to 
communicate quickly.

Thanks,

Cara

Subject: About the Sales Volume Report

Cara,

The Sales Volume Report picks up deals that:
1.  Are Approved             
2.  Are Done                     (not Killed or Pending)
3.  Are Physical                (not Financial)
4.  Have "Forward" as part of the Deal Type (..."Forward", "Index-Forward")
5.  Are a Sale                   (not Buys)
6.  Have sheduled date of the flow that starts between the dates selected by 
the user of the report (not strip start date as seen in Deal Entry)

The report groups the data by region

For any additions/changes of the Sales Volume Report please have the above 
restrictions in mind.
Let us know what items you wanted to be changed (or added) and in what way.
That will be of great help in implementing your request for changes.

Thanks!
Nikolay
