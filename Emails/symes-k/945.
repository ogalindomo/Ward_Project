Effective 12/31/00, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P., CP ID 72297 merged 
with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., CP ID 53350.  I have received 
copies of the Secretary of State certificate as well as the Certificate of 
Merger.  Today, I suspended the old record, so that new business will not 
attach to it.  Normally, notification would have been sent out on the 15th of 
the month, but since I have received phone calls, e-mails expressing 
concern,  and  copies of the documents from various groups (I appreciate 
it!), we thought it best to send notification now.  It will also appear on 
the next report.

Thanks,
