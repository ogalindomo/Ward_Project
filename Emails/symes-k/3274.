Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with 
deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time 
sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source 
of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting 
the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but 
I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with 
questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!



Thanks,
