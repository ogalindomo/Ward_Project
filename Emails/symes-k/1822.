We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in 
the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean 
he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out 
though!

Thanks,
Kate

Kate this trade is from yesterday.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?
