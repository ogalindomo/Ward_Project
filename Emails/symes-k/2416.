Mike negotiated no broker fee on this - he just spoke to his broker and asked 
to have them stop asking for that. 

Thanks,
Kate

P.S. I know the feeling about needing a vacation - sooner rather than later! 
Hang in there!

I know it's time for a vacation now....sorry that number is for the broker 
ref.  The correct deal number is 542839.

This deal is in under Short Term California, not Long Term Northwest, and the 
trader is Phil Platter, not Mike Swerzbin, and there is no broker. Are you 
sure this is the deal in question?

Kate
