We have duplicate records in the system. 

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, CP ID 55900, and

Deutsche Bank AG, CP ID 92230

Credit has verified that the correct legal name should be Deutsche Bank, AG.  
A record in that name was just created in GCP in Feb '01.  In order to 
preserve the history on the old record, and since one name is just an 
abbreviated form of the other, I will make the correction on the older 
record, 55900 to change it to "AG" and suspend the newer record, 92230, 
pending inactivation on 04/01/01.  This is not an overlay, so I wanted to 
provide some explanation in advance. 

Please note the overlays.  These changes were made in GCP today, with the 
noted exception.  The summary of those changes are on the "Mar 01 Changes" 
tab (refer to bottom left corner), to see the detail for those entries, see 
the "Mar 2001" bottom tab.

Shortname changes will be coordinated w/ ERMS IT on Friday, March 16.

Records will be inactivated on April 2, 2001.





Thanks,
