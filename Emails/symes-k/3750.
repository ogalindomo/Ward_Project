I'm not sure what's going on with these options, but I entered them as 2 PM 
expiry, then got a message that they were 2 AM from Stephanie Piwetz this 
morning, changed them AGAIN, and now they're back to 2 AM. I've changed them 
again, but I honestly have no idea why they keep going back. Please let me 
know if you see the expiry as 2 PM now.

Thanks,
Kate
