Energy type is Firm in EnPower - is this correct? Counterparty seems to 
disagree. Please let me know when you get a chance.

Kate, could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower. 
Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent. Could you ask him 
which is correct?
