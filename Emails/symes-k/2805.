I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time 
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is 
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something 
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we see 
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of 
these deals are fixed.

I just ran a forward ob for April 2 to check for deals that are in PST when 
they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

I am particularly worried about how these are corrected because they are long 
term transmission deals that cannot be autoscheduled.
