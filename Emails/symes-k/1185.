i think it was done after our checkout yesterday, and i noticed i had not 
received a confirm on the deal and it also was not on the summary.  but, i 
just spoke with apb and it is good. 

thanks!

Tom checked with APB and they recognize the trade. Are they not checking out 
correctly in the back office?
