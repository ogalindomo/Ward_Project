Just in case this is news to you, I've spoken with Ben Gwaltney (A/P) in 
Houston about processing rebates.  He explained that when applying for the 
rebate, have the rebate check payable to Enron.  Send the rebate check in on 
a Deposit Transmittal Form, and code it with the same codes you had used to 
process the initial expense (company #, expense code and cost center to which 
the rebate should be credited).  If a Deposit Transmittal Form is unavailable 
to you, you can just staple the check to a piece of paper showing the 
appropriate codes.  Mail this deposit form with the rebate check via 
inter-company mail to:  Treasury, Sam Round EB2703.

If I've left someone off of this message who would find this information 
helpful, please pass it on.

Have a good weekend!
