Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!
Kim
