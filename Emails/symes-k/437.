Samuel,

Please set up Kate Symes as a trader with access to all of the West power 
desks.    She is taking over for Carla Hoffman as a Deal Control specialist.
She frequently has to enter California deals (PX,  ISO,  etc) in addition to 
bilateral transaction deal entry.

If you have questions,  please give me a call.

Thanks,
JMF
