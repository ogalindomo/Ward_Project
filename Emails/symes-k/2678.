sorry - we changed the year and just changed each strip - but since it was 
originally entered in deal blotter it had those extra strips and, long story 
short, it should be right now.

thanks
Kate

I believe this deal was changed, bu tnot changed correctly.  The hours are 
doubled up and it is running 32 hours a day.

Thanks!
