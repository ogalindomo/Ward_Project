Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

for some reason that contact was inactivated -if that's definitely the 
contact, i'll have gcp re-activate it.  that's strange, i wonder why  it was 
inactivated.  just let me know.

The contact name is Jack Wells, and his phone number is (281) 293-6030. Would 
you like me to enter this info into the deals?

Kate

hi kate,
these sean crandall deals need contacts.  can you please get a good contact 
name (and phone #) and i will put in a gcp request to have it added to the 
drop down list in deal entry.
i'm too lazy to press the shift key lately, sorry -no caps.
thanks for your help!
