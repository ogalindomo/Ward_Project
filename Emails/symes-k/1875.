Kate,
Amerex has a deal on their web checkout traded by Diana on 2/14 where:
Enron buys from Coral 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 2/15-2/16 at $420.00

I do not see this deal in Enpower.  


When I checked out with Amerex on the 14th all deals were confirmed.  When I 
cleared their deals all deals were cleared.
It is our policy to go back and check their web site for additions, changes 
etc. once every week for the week before and this deal popped up.

Can you please check to see if the schedulers received any confirmation of 
flow for this deal from Coral?

Thanks!!
