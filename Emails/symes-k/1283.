Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna
