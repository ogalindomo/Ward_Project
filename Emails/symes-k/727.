Sorry for the confusion, Geir. When I got the e-mail from Houston it gave me 
the deal numbers and your name - I didn't even look in the comments section. 
My fault! If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname, that 
would be great. Thanks for your help.

Hey

Just for the record I would like to make clear that I did not enter these 
deals. Our new trader  uses my tradee id when I work with him.( He writes 
entered by ......   in the comment section. I will point out the mistake to 
him so we can make sure it does not happen again.

Geir
