I just heard back from Holli Krebs, who verified that Puget is right on this 
deal - the term should be December through February. I've changed it in the 
system.

Thanks,
Kate

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

Thanks!
