Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

Kate
