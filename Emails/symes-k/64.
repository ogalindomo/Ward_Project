Hello,

I just spoke with Holly at Raphael House.  She said that the meeting on 
Thursday, Nov. 2, will be at 6 pm at the downtown Marriott (1041 SW 
Naito-within walking distance from here).  The meeting will be held on the 
Ballroom Level, which is one floor below the lobby.  If you are interested in 
the 8 am - Noon or Noon - 4 pm shifts on Saturday, you are encouraged to 
attend this meeting.  If you cannot make the meeting, then just show up at 
those times on Saturday.  I plan on going to the meeting on Thursday, so let 
me know if you're interested in going together.

Thanks again and hopefully this is the last e-mail!  ;0
