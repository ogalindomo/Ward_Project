As we've discussed, the switch from PX to DJ index still seems problematic 
for deal # 404980 (the original deal).  Please double check the deal entry in 
the new deals you've created (#512726.1 and #512743.1) to substitute the 
original one, and let us know how things are going asap so we can correct our 
distorted P&L report.

Thanks,
Fran
