Hi Kate,
I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!
Kim
