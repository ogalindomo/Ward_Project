With Teri's departure, Grace Rodriguez will begin to assist me and Rick 
Johnson on HR related matters.  She will also continue to support the 
Technical Analysis group until a suitable replacement has been identified.  
In the meantime, Grace will be supported by Elizabeth Squires to assist with 
ad hoc duties.

Please join me in congratulating Grace on her new responsibilities.

Amy
