As many of you know, I am relocating myself and my family to Portland.  I 
have a found a new house (yeah!) but need to move my family up here before 
the house will be ready.  So,  I am looking for a house to sit or a furnished 
house or apartment to rent. Two bedrooms or larger.  We would occupy the 
abode through April 14.  I can begin the sit/rental immediately but no later 
than March 31.  

If you know of something, please come see me.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes
