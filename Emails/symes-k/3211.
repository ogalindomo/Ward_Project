Attached is an inactivation of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P., CP ID 
93330 and an overlay of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc., CP ID 54292.   
Per the March 2001 report, this entity converted to a limited liability 
company.    We did not receive any documentation at that time.  Ten days 
later, it converted again to a limited partnership.  Per our normal 
procedures, a new record was created for the limited partnership.  The "Inc" 
record was to be inactivated on 04/02/01.  In the meantime, a legal opinion 
was issued to state that this should be treated as a name change and that an 
overlay should be done.  I have overlayed the "Inc" record with "LP", and the 
newly created LP record, CP ID 93330 will be inactivated.
