Yes, 484077.01 is correct as 350.00, just had in question 484076.01.  Thanks

Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I 
checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, 
and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes 
this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct?

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, 
I called earlier to check out with Prebon, of course all the West guys were 
gone to checkout, I spoke to a broker on the NY desk.
Please check the price of deal 
484076.01 (Mark Fischer)   $325.00  (broker thought price looked like 330.00)
484077.01                                $350.00

Thanks 
Stephanie
