I just created a new spreadsheet for the 13th.  I created this sheet from the 
7th, which was the last sheet we had without this little version problem.

Note that any special jurry-rigging you have done to the sheet in the last 
few days WILL NOT BE THERE because I had to go back to the 7th.

To repeat my favorite phrase of the day:

NEVER, EVER SELECT NEW WINDOW!
