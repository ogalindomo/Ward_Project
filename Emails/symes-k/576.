We are going to start using a single application to wait for PX prices in the 
morning (get funky) and to upload specific prices manually.  Whereas in the 
past we used an application called PX_Live and an application called 
PX_Capture, we will now use just one application called PX_Capture.

You can get to this application from the Portland menu (Start > Programs > 
Portland > Scheduling > PX_Capture.exe).  The PX_Live choice will go away 
from your menu choice.
