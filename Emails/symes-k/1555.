Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Kim
