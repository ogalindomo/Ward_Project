Amy -
?
I'd like to express my interest in the position  open in the Real Time group. 
I've spoken with Bill Williams III and Jeff Richter  regarding the 
opportunity, and both are very supportive of my desire to move and  learn 
within the company. 
?
I am attaching a copy of my updated resume for you  to review. Please let me 
know if you have any trouble opening the file, as this  is the first e-mail 
attachment I've sent from my "Click-at-Home" computer. (How  exciting!)
?
Thank you for considering my interest in this  position. I'd like to talk 
with you more about?the opportunity as soon as  you get a chance.
