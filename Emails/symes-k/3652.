Please review...
Deal 589940.01, comment says David Porter entered.  April 24 trade date   
Enron Sells Mirant   April 23 346.00  7 mws  Malin dp 
Mirant sent back Enron negative confirmation (requires no signature) with 
phrase "we do not agree with this trade"

Is there another piece to trade or can David Porter speak with Mirant...
