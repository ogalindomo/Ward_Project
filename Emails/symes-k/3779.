Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy 
backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me 
know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 
days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th.

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.
