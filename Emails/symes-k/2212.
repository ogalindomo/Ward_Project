The above web site offers some good advice in the form of a list of items
to have ready in the event of a major earthquake here in Portland.
 Drinking water, flashlights, and first aid kits are some of the bare
necessities.
I can tell you from experience that if or when an earthquake hits you will
be glad you took the time to  prepare some of these items.

rock on.
