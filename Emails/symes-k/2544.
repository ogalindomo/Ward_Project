These deals have been changed to reflect the correct counterparty name, and 
I've forwarded the message to the real time traders who did the deals and 
their manager. Thanks for the heads up!

540039, 541695, 541715, and 541737 are booked to Enmax Corporation.  I think 
they should be booked to Enmax Energy Corporation.  Wendy Conwell in credit 
has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct 
entity.  Can you check?
