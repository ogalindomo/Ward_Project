Bob's out of the office now, but I'll check with him in the morning. This 
very well could be the correct delivery point, but thanks for checking. I'll 
get back to you.

Hi Kate!
This deal has a strange delivery point -ZP-26.  Is that right?  It might be, 
but it's just strange, so I thought I'd ask.
Thanks!
Kim
