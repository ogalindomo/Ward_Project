I have changed the Index Multiplier for all of the days in January.  The days 
that were not at a mulitplier of 1.05 have been changed to that amount. Also, 
there was no deal in for 1/9, and 2 identical deals for 1/10.  I modified one 
of the 1/10 days to the 1/9 amount.

I will begin autoscheduling these shortly so the price will show.
