Bill Williams just talked to Jake, the Sempra trader who did the trade, who 
recognized the deal and said he'd speak with Harry and clear it up. In the 
meantime, this is a good trade.

Kate, 
Deal 567990.01, trader at Sempra, does not show this trade.   Harry from the 
backoffice called. 
Please ask Leaf.

Thanks
Stephanie
