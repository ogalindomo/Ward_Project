Jeff-

Christie Patrick, Vince Kaminski and I are going to be attending an 
e-business conference at Wharton on the 20th of October.  We will also be 
taking the opportunity to meet with campus representatives on the 19th 
regarding various university affairs.

We would like to have you join us for any part of this if your schedule 
permits.  If you are interested, I'll be glad to send you the details.
