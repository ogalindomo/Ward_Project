Shanna - thanks for the latest version (received this morning) of the bonus / 
Keysop summary for the coal group.  Everything is correct.

I would like to add my personal thanks for your efforts since you have been 
handling our group.  It is great to have you on board.  You have added a 
level of professionalism to our HR effort that is greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,

George
