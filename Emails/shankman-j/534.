My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.

Thanks

Before we sign ANYTHING with Southern about the Elba volumes, I'd like an 
update.  Also I want to make sure we aren't trading anything away at Elba 
that we could be talking about elsewhere.  Thanks.
