I think this may be the junior trader your are looking for. If you don't want 
him -- I will certainly interview him for fundamentals, but I think he is 
over qualified

Sir Fraser,


In June 2001 I will graduate from the University of Chicago with a Master of
Science degree in Financial Mathematics.
I have graduated from the IFP (French Institute of Petroleum) Engineering
School in Paris with a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Economics.

I am very interested in a career in Energy markets and I would like to know
more about your activities in the Energy markets.

Would it be possible to schedule an informational interview at your
convenience ?

I am attaching my resume to give you some background about myself.
I thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear form you soon.


David A. Michalon

Program on Financial Mathematics
