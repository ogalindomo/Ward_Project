Subject: Investment Banking Reports

Attached are the weekly IB reports.  Since I'm in London there will be no 
hard copies this week and hopefully it will be up on the EGM Website this 
afternoon.  If you'd like copies of the full reports themselves, please just 
email me and I'll figure out a way to get them to you.  Everyone have a great 
holiday.

Sarah
