yes...my mom left this morning, and I have three weeks to recoup before I see 
her again.  She is the nicest person ever, and I feel so guilty that she 
annoys me.  I am sure I will have a daughter one day who thinks I am totally 
annoying too.  what goes around comes around!  
are you better today?  what are you doing for lunch?  did anything good get 
delivered???
