Jeff -

Jean and I wanted to say thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent along.
They brightened up the place, as did copious quantities of vodka, gin, and
bourbon (mixed liberally with Reggae music).

I have been away in NYC for most of the week, and am headed there again on
Monday, so my apologies for this tardy "gracias".  I did see the Venetian 
Glass
show at the American Craft Museum, and it was quite good.  Hope to stop by 
Barry
Friedman's next week for his show, but business may interfere.

Glad to see you making headway toward becoming a neighbor.  Hope to see you 
when
time permits.

JRG
