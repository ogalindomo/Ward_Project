I went to mia bella--and I think i'm with you on the dont' like it thought.  
I thought i was going to hurl on my hardwoods last night.  crashed about 
10:30pm.  
I figure you all could come over for a glass of wine first (and I can show ms 
tobor the house) then head over.  My flight is at 9:40 pm tonight, and I 
haven't packed yet.  Unless you have another idea???????????
