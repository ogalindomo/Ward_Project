Subject: follow up on Saudi


	

Just to reiterate:  Yes the Saudis are against $40 oil or above.  However, if 
the Israel thing gets bad and a lot of people die or it turns into a 
religious war over al-Aqsa mosque, the rulers will come under serious 
pressure to not help the West by producing more oil.

Arab leaders are holding a summit Oct 21 in Cairo.
