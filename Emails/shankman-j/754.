Jeff,

I went to talk to Steve Horn this morning and he seemed happy with the idea 
of me going over to HTC. I will now work on settling a date for me to 
transfer. I am very happy about this experience and want to express my 
gratitude for all your help and suggestions. I will definitely let you know 
how it is once I move over there.

Again, thank you.

Massimo
