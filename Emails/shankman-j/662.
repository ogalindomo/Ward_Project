Talk to scott tholan, who runs competitive analysis.  I'm not sure what else 
clay works on.  I don't  dislike the concept, but he deals with a lot of 
confidential info.

JS;
I think Clay should sit with my group and become more involved in our daily 
reports. I also believe his skills would be best used by developing some more 
detailed analyses
What do you think
