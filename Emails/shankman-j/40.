Dear Jeff,

Happy (somewhat belated) new year.  I hope you are doing well in sunny
downtown Houston.  I am writing from Princeton where minutes ago I
happily finished my Economics exam, the last of the semester.  In
reviewing the agenda for the rest of the academic year, I thought it
might be a good time to finalize summer plans as well.
     I will be occupied with a job here at Princeton until June 3 - I am
working logistics for part of this year's reunions.  After that date, I
would need only a day or two of turnaround time before coming out to
Houston.  I could conceivably be in the office by Wednesday, June 6.
Depending upon your needs at the office and the possibility of a short
cultural study on a small island off of the coast of western Sumatra, I
could plan on being in Houston until at least early August.  Please let
me know what your plans are on the other end.

Thanks in advance for your attention.
Sincerely, Dan
