Thanks again for the invitation last night.  I had a great time.....

I  have called Michelle Marvin to let her know that I will be happy to speak 
at the Wharton conference.

Barbara and I would enjoy having  you and Lisa over for dinner sometime in 
the next few weeks.  Please let us know what would be convenient for you.

All the best,

Tom
