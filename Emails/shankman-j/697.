JS:
I just met with Chris Gaskill and Kevin McGowan. We are in dire need of 
analysts. I proposed the following and would like your buy-in:
1- A return trip to Wharton to get more finance and engineering grads.
2- An off cycle super Saturday based on the resumes we pull from the 
collection Ted Bland put together.

Thanks
JEn
