Jeff,

I am in London with Rick Bergseiker today.  We would like to talk with you 
for a moment concerning the winter cargoes they are trying to buy and sell.  
I was told you are traveling today, but if you get this message and have an 
opportunity to discuss this would you please return this email and let me 
know how I can reach you, or you can try Rick on his cell phone.  I do not 
have that number, but will attempt to locate it.

Thanks,

Eric
