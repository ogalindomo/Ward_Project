Hi everyone,

We've just returned from a vacation to the Pacific
Northwest.  Some of you know because we visited you
there.  This is a picture of us at Crater Lake in
southern Oregon.  The trip was simultaneously
wonderful and sad.  We saw the greatest people and
most breathtaking scenery on our way to the funeral of
our friend Richard, a beautiful person who died after
a long battle with cancer.  I'm wearing his red sox
cap in the picture which has been returned to the city
from which it came.

Last week Maddie had her first birthday which was
attended by many family and friends.  Keep checking
the photo gallery for pictures from this event as well
as halloween trick-or-treating once we get the film
developed.  The web site is as follows:

We've put up a few more vacation pictures as well.

Hope this finds you all well and enjoying life and
each other.

Love Adam, Nic and Maddie
