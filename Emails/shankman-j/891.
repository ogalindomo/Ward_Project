Jeff, 

I'll call you later today to talk about Bob Rose at Bank America.  He's been 
trading crude with them for a while, and I believe he's well respected in the 
market.  He might be in the market for a job, but wants to keep a low 
profile.  

If we have a fit for him, he could bring a lot of value to Enron.

-Greg
