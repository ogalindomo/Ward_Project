Jeff,

Great to see you yesterday.  Hope your presentation went well and
congratulations again on your new position.

As promised, here's Adrienne's address:

Adriene and Neil Tuch
1453 Kings Lane
Palo Alto, CA 94303

And here's Vicki's too, while I'm at it:

Vicki and Norm Petty
11 E. Franklin Ave.
Pennington, NJ 08584

Also, Michael Baker will be calling you this week to talk more about the
Center for Advanced Studies in India; we'd love to have someone from
Enron involved.

Maybe we can catch up again when you are here later this month.   Best,

--
