Jeff - Jupiter is in doubt as a fourth quarter deal due to Massey's inability 
to focus on the deal.  They are still trying to solve their waste coal spill, 
and are working on the reverse spinoff from Fluor.  I talked with Don 
Blakenship today, and he says they are still trying to do the deal this 
quarter - I obviously have my doubts, and moved it to Q1.

British Energy is being pushed to Q1 as well.  BE has declared their option 
tons and are delaying deliveries under our existing contract through April.  
They are hoping to miss the current bullish market by waiting to begin 
serious negotiations until early next year.

George, I just saw the updated 4Q earnings outlook, and saw Jupiter, and 
British energy off the sheet.  Is Jupiter off because of the Massey problems 
you mentioned today.  What about British energy....
