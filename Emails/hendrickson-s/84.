Well, today is the last working day in Germany until next Tues and Armin
says we are actually going to NOT work!  Heather arrives from London
tonight, but we don#t know what all we're going to do, just enjoy the
company and the break!

Want to wish you all a wonderful Easter!

Connie,Armin and Angus
