BRUCE, 
??????????? It was  a real pleasure to meet you and your friends at the dice 
table the last couple  of days, I am glad you had a good time as I love to 
hear that when guests are  here at the hotel. When you decide to come back to 
vegas Bruce please give me a  call to set up your arrangements. I look 
forward to hearing from you  soon.???? Take Care!!!
