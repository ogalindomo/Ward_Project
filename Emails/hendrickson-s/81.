Well, I am in shock about Frank...I just NEVER would have thought it of him.
Did Susan say how Karen is doing?  Is she working again?  It really makes me
sad when things like that happen.  Why can't people just keep their
commitments, why does it hardly ever work out that people stay together
anymore...like our parents did...

How's your mom doing today?  Is she still in shock?  Please keep us posted
on how things are going for her.  We will keep her in our prayers.

Write when you can,
connie

PS What does Susan and Renato think about what Frank has done???
