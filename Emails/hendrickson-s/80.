Just talked with Stinson and he is going to give Rayfael a call to set up an 
"informal" talk.

He says what they do is bring in people with Rayfael's level of technical 
expertise, but no financial skills as a Sr. Specialist so they can learn the 
business.  They really don't use the Associate/Analyst route for hiring 
people.

Tell Rayfael to expect the call, or he may in fact want to give Stinson a 
call directly (34748).
