That was one of the funniest things I have ever seen on the internet.
Reminds me of that Chilton video. I am just a sucker for good fart humor. My
trip to Egypt has come through! I am leaving Friday and returning Feb 11. I
would like to come down to Houston for one of the parades art car or pride
or both. Whatever. Good weekends for me (Fridays off) are March 2, 16, 30.
Find out if you can get a hall pass or when the parades are and we will
discuss when I return. I sent in my 12th man pledge today. The deadline is
the 30th.
