Well, not everything, but we were able to get 2 chairs, a desk, our computers,
the fax and printer out of her office.  She wouldn't let us take any of the 
rest
of the furniture...BUT THAT'S OK!!!! We have all we need to work out of the 
new
office!!!! IT'S SO GREAT>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Our new telephone number will be working maybe even this evening!  Lolo and
Armin are still working on it.  I help Lolo pull the last cables thru this
evening.  Now he JUST has to connect all those pretty colored wires!  I gave 
out
an incorrect number, (I think) before.  Our main number will be 0931 9911910 
and
my desk will be 99119119...I think.  Too many 1's and 9's, but I like it 
anyway!

Tomorrow I will start scrubbing out all of the file cabinets, that are all so
filthy...then I will start to unpack the files.  During that time, I hope Lolo
and Armin have all the technical stuff working!!!

HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!  And that you are as happy as we are right 
now!!!
