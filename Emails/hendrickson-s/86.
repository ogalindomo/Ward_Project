Subject: Easter Sunday


In order to do something semi-Easter related, we have brunch reservations
at 11:30 am on Sunday at Commander's Palace in the Aladdin.  Jim will
already be gone, but I think everybody else will still be around.  I took
the liberty of making the reservations, because it will probably fill up -
Easter and all...
