Well, I am sitting here in pain and bored.  Armin is having a meeting with
one of our building site architects.  the reason I'm in pain is that I
forgot to reach in HARD for the handshake...germans try to CRUSH YOUR HAND
when they shake, and unfortunately today I was wearing a ring and didn't
reach in hard 1st!  so my little finger is bruised...

What else is happening?  Write me!!!! BITTE!!!! I am so BORED!!!
