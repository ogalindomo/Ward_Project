Thanks much. We really appreciate your help on this. 

Has a follow up meeting been set for next week as discussed in our call of 
last week? We would like to send a representative (or two) and would be happy 
to set a meeting up. Please let me know.

Regards,

Ben

Drawings were sent to Chuck Newell today.  As you stated, we need Sharon's
CA before Chuck can share technical detail with her.

Lynn:

Thanks for the e-mail. If Chuck's CA has been executed and returned to you,
then I would assume you can go ahead and send him the drawings. I
understand that if Sharon wants the drawings, she will have to sign a
seperate CA. Sending the drawings to Chuck, covered by his executed CA,
will certainly speed up the process. Let me know if you have any
objections.

Thanks,

Ben
