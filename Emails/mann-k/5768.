Herman/Billy,

This is still very early in the process, but some thought as to structure 
options for earning recognition might be worthwhile.

Subject: Re: NRG bullet points  

I've made some revisions the Bill's document to make sure we are on the same 
page before I prepare the LOI.  



Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?

Thanks,

Kay
