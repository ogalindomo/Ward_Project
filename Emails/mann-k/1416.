Kay,

Just a couple minor edits.  One, this amendment only covers 4 Standard Base
Exhaust Stacks, so to reference the dwgs for the Heavy Base Exhaust Stacks
and Extensions isn't necessary and could be confusing to somebody "down the
road".

The other adds the October 31, 2000 delivery date for the stacks.

How's the other Amendment related to Brazil?  John Ayres told me yesterday
that he found it hung-up waiting on instruction and permission slip.  Now,
it's supposedly unstuck, with Kathy Clark.  Can you cut it loose?

Also, we have another Amendment in the works to add a Step-up Transformer
for ENA - West, Pleasanton, CA.  I believe Sharon Tweed has this one in the
works per the Portland gang.

Not sure where you and Kent stand on the review of the LV Expansion Facility
Agreement.

Maybe we can visit by phone on Monday?

Lee
