Hi Chris,

Any opinion on the major component question?

Taking a quick look at the CO I am not sure what are GE's comments.  Do we 
have a redline copy showing GE's comments?

I can't remember if I made this comment previously, but are the exhaust 
stacks considered "major components" (or whatever the correct defined term is 
under the Agreement)  for purposes of delay LD's?  If so, then we need to 
revise the CO accordingly.  

Also, do we need the defined term "Purchase Amount Increase" in Section 3(b) 
in Part II?

Is this ok with everybody?  It incorporates GE's latest comments.
