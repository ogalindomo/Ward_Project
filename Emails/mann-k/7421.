None of the in-house lawyers are in today Ann Elizabeth's last email to me 
before she went on vacation implied that A&K are to be the surrogate in-house 
counsel I suggest we schedule a call between A&K (Chris and Darren) , David 
Layman and myself.  Can we do this this moring?  

Dial In: 1 (888) 301-0489

Passcode: 6797257

I propose 10:30 am central and 11:30 am eastern.  The Dial in and pass code 
will be good for what ever time we agree to.
