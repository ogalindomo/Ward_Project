Hi Wilson,

It would be great if we could talk this week.  I'm under the gun right now, 
but will you be available on Friday for a chat?

Thanks,

Kay

My conflicts check turned up no problems, so I'm looking forward to working 
with you. I have looked over the LOI you sent. Please let me know who you 
want to proceed from here.
