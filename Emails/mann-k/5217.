Wed. morning I will be either (1) in route to San Antonio in which case I 
should be able to tie in via cell phone although I may not have the ability 
to view documents or (2) attending a business closing in Houston.  With 
respect to the rest of the week, I can be available for part of Tuesday 
afternoon or anytime Thursday or Friday.  In case we try to convene on 
Thursday or Friday, let me know by close of business Tuesday so that I can 
take the appropriate materials with me to San Antonio.
