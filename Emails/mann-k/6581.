Thanks Peter for new revision 6 to the form agreement.

A minor detail: Pursuant to somewhat recent changes to New York law, we 
should add in Section 28.2 "pursuant to New York General Obligations Law 
Section 5-1401," after "with this Agreement," in the 2nd line (unless anyone 
objects).  I believe such change will benefit both parties and simply 
reinforces that New York is the controlling law.
