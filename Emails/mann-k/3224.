Subject: Escrow instruction letters




Carolyn/Kay - 
I apologize for the latest of getting these documents to you, but I was 
unaware of the timeline until just an hour ago. 

Doug/John - I've left 5 originals of each letter for Jeff's signature in his 
office.? He will sign when he gets in and I will bring them around to you 
around 8am.
