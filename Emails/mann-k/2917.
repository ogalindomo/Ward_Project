Subject: Escrow Agreement

Citibank just confirmed that they will also accept faxed signatures on the 
Escrow Agreement.  Have you approved it yet?  If so, and we let accounting 
know to wire the funds to Citibank before 2:00, we can get the $ in the 
Escrow Account by tomorrow.  Otherwise, the funds will not get there until 
Friday.
