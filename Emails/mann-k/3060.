 <<Comparison of ABB Agreement- Original to Final Form.DOC>>

Your e-mail is the first I had seen of the override letter.  Attached is
the blackline you requested showing changes from the original West
LB/ABB Agreement to the final form agreement.  Can we set up a time
early tomorrow to discuss this (or late tonight)?  I have a conference
call in 2 minutes  that will probably last a couple of hours.  Please
leave a voice mail letting me know when you want to discuss the ABB
override letter.
