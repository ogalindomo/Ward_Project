Brian,

Attached is the exhibit list for the GE-Enron contracts.  What I have
attempted to do is list what exhibits I see that are finished and what ones
still require action.  All exhibits highlighted in yellow are closed from
GE's perspective. Please review the list and let me know if you agree with
the status at this point.  Once we do that we can figure out how best to
close up the other exhibits.

Thanks,

Steve Swift
