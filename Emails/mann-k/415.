No.  I'll have Neil check (he does all that stuff).

I was just wondering if you got that sorted out this morning.  I have copies 
and will get them to you.  Have you checked to see if the checks cleared the 
bank?

I have neglected to follow through on those dues checks that didn't make it 
to where they should have.  Could I get a copy of copies you kept?

Thanks,
