Drawings were sent to Chuck Newell today.  As you stated, we need Sharon's
CA before Chuck can share technical detail with her.

Lynn:

Thanks for the e-mail. If Chuck's CA has been executed and returned to you,
then I would assume you can go ahead and send him the drawings. I
understand that if Sharon wants the drawings, she will have to sign a
seperate CA. Sending the drawings to Chuck, covered by his executed CA,
will certainly speed up the process. Let me know if you have any
objections.

Thanks,

Ben
