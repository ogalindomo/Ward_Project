We need to change the alcohol and drug stuff.  Please call me to discuss 
tomorrow morning - I'll be in after 900.

Thanks,

Kay

Just wanted to let you know that I have a doctor's appointment at 3 pm
CST tomorrow.  It will probably last an hour. Chris Cobb ((202)
662-3016) will be available in my absence.

Do you want me to stick around any more tonight to make any additional
changes or just come in at 7 am CST tomorrow?
