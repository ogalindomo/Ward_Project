With Outlook, we won't be able to file as much on the email.  If you get to 
your 100mg limit, you won't be able to send emails.  I think you should print 
out the emails and have hard copies to be on the safe side.  I also don't 
know what will migrate as far as address books, etc.  I won't be here for 
this, and have asked Janette to let me migrate on Tuesday.  Otherwise, I'm 
going to be in a world of hurt.

The weather in SF is supposed to be nice.  I haven't checked it today.

I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of 
where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of 
course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be 
David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?

Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?

Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.

Kay
