Kay:

1.  I am now sending over a package with documents for execution by ENA or
the LLC.  I believe that everything is included except for the membership
certificates.

2.  Greg Lang advised this morning that the PPL membership certificate will
need to be in the possession of the collateral agent on the closing date,
and asked if we would agree on an understanding to have the certificate
delivered in escrow to the collateral agent the night before closing.  I
said we could accommodate his request.  We will need to get the membership
certificates signed early next week.

3.  Greg asked whether ENA made the timing on its notices etc. to close on
Wednesday, May 2.  Please advise.

4.  Greg also wants ENA to discuss with GE the timing on the delivery of the
L/C.  This may affect the wording in the escrow disbursement instruction
letter, but it will not affect the signature page.

Thanks.
