Andrea,

Thank you for sending the schedule of fees, investment options, appropriate 
tax forms and Incumbency Certificate
for establishing the new account.  Per your request, I have attached the 
escrow agreement and Letter Agreement for your review.  

Please feel free to contact me 713 345-3346 should you have any questions or 
concerns.

Regards,

Chris Booth
