Attached is the final execution ESA Option (I am still waiting for Brett's
final okay) which I understand is not a substantive issue only a logistics
matter.

John, if you are in proximity of Brett, please obtain his  final okay (this
is the same document I distributed to him yesterday -- I was able to get
Exhibit A attached to the document -- this is the only difference).

Brett, please let me and John know that it this document is approved then
John, please initial so that Brett can sign.  I presume Brett and John are
together but if not, John please let Brett know when your initialied
authorization is given.

Thanks.
