Jerry and Marguerite:

As promised, attached please find Citibank's form of Incumbency Certificate,
which I have customized for your client on a very preliminary basis.  I am
also attaching the W-9 tax form that NorthWestern will need to present to
Citibank for purposes of establishing an escrow account.  Should Citibank
require any additional documentation, I will notify you of what is required.

Regards,

Marisa Reuter
