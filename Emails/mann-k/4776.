This is the rock gym party.  I bought presents for this and the Houstonian 
party, which is next Wednesday.

Is this the one at the Houstonian? What are the hours? Maybe I could drop
him off and come back to pick him up? NM

Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know
Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt
to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.
