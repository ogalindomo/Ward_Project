I don't think this agreement  will be on the agenda until next week.

If things change (moving up or back), I'll let you know.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the form interconnection agreement provided by Virgina Power, for 
your information, review, etc. It is a new form which is currently under 
review by VEPCO.
