I believe that Ben has talked with Janet on this issue.  My understanding is 
that the units are still committed to the LV deal, but that ENA management 
would consider a bona-fide offer from a 3rd party if the terms were right.

Does this mean the LV Co Gen deal has fallen apart, or are there some new 
LM's in our future?
