Kay, as we discussed here's the brief description Bart had circulated within
Enron regarding our participation on this project:

Nick Politan will be in overall charge of the project, and will be
the principal in charge of outside legal review of development matters,
including the EPC and equipment procurement contracts, assisted by Rick
Filosa.
Both Nick and Rick are located in Bingham's New York office. Bruce Silvers
will
handle Connecticut regulatory matters, and Mark Oland will handle
Connecticut
real estate and permitting. Bruce and Mark are located in Bingham's Hartford
office.

We all look forward to working with you and please don't hesitate to call
any of us at any time.
