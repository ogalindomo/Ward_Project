It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let 
me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it 
at your convenience.  

Thanks - Gregg
