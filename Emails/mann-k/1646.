David,
Attached below is the draft form EPC contract (cost-plus, like we discussed 
at our mtgs in SF this week) that I sent to Lisa, Roseann and Sheila last 
night.

Karen Jones (in Portland) and Sheila Tweed have been working on just the same 
thing, so I'm forwarding your request to them.

Subject: Standard EPC contract

Next week, Herman and I will be working on a generic 97-10 compliant EPC 
contract.

Could you forward electronic versions of 1) basic fixed price EPC contract 
and 2) basic Cost Plus EPC contract.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.
