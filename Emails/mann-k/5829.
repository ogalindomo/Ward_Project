    Attached is a clean copy of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
(second document below), as well as a blacline (first document below)
showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12. This
draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.  It
also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills when
she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
order). to complete the agreement, we will need to include the date of
execution and Exhibit H-2.
