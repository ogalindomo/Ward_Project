Subject: Volunteers for CPS BEAR Table on December 18

Volunteers:

Many thanks for volunteering to help with this great cause.  Listed below are 
the volunteers for the CPS BEAR table for Monday, December 18.  Volunteers 
please plan to arrive at the CPS BEAR (Be A Resource) table in the lobby of 
the Enron building which will be located by the down escalator.  We will need 
to have the table staffed from 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  You will be collecting
