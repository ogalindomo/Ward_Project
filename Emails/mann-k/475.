Subject: Environmental Permits Matrix

Attached is a generic spreadsheet that lists environmental activities and 
approvals for power projects.  I have divided it into three different sheets 
that represent:  1) activities/permits required prior to construction, 2) 
activities/permits after start of construction and prior to commercial 
operation, and 3) activities/permits after start of commercial operation. 

I see it being a worthwhile effort to produce a separate list for each 
project, including schedule milestones and responsible parties.  Whether each 
list is generated by me, an environmental consultant, legal counsel, the 
developer, etc. is something we should decide on a project by project basis.  
I would appreciate your comments on this.

By the way, I don't consider this generic spreadsheet to contain an 
exhaustive list of possible permits.  There are a number of other potential 
approvals, such as occupancy permit, driveway permit, environmental resource 
permit, etc. that aren't on this spreadsheet.  We really need to assess each 
project individually.
