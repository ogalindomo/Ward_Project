That Paul has a cloud over him.  At least he has time to heal before baseball 
season.

We are planning on spending Saturday night.  Neil and I will stay at the B & 
B.

Enjoy this great weather.  I hear more rain is forecast for the weekend - 
hope they are wrong!

Love,

Kay

I forgot to tell you Paul was in a wreck Saturday afternoon late. He is
O.K. except for a broken arm. He was with the Mayor of Palacios and his
grandson. They were on the way to the high school and someone pulled out
intothem. Mother
