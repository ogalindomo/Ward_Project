Kay,

I spoke to Raul Salas of Shutts & Bowen re: amending the arrangment we have 
for the Certosa Holdings property.  He called me back to say that his client 
will be in Miami Wednesday but wanted us to pay the Shutts & Bowen invoice 
before we meet.  I think Certosa Holdings is not paying its bills.  But they 
did remove the last lien on the property.  We will need to develop a 
structure where we pay something to Certosa Holdings so it can recoup some 
costs but we will also need to cover future legal and consulting costs 
incurred by Certosa Holdings. Can you help??  Would you be available for at 
least a call Wednesday or Thursday?  

I'll be back in Miami Tuesday but I can be reached over the weekend on my 
cell 713 857 0367 or my pager 877 461 4413.  I'll also try to check my email 
daily
