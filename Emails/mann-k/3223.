thanx for voice mail.

the marked up letter, along with cc of the contract, is on front left corner 
of my desk (as viewed from chair).

attached is draft of response letter - needs to be revised to pick up above 
comments.  also, per our conversation, our understanding is that this letter 
was to go out under ben's signature.

regards.  scott.
