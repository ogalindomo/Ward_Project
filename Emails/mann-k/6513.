Billy, 

It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, 
the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since 
construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 
E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it 
could be immediately prior to that time.  

Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed 
this agreement before she left.

Hi Billy,

Can you take a look at this since the Hermanator is out?

Thanks,

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay

to do so.
