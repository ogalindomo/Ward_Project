Subject: Citibank's documents for upcoming escrow


Chris,

As we discussed I am attaching our schedule of fees for services as escrow
agent.  Please forward me a copy of the escrow agreement and the underlying
document (Purchase Letter) at your earliest convenience so we may begin to
review these.

I am also attaching a list of Money Market investment options for review by
Northwestern as well as the appropriate tax forms and Incumbency Certificate
for establishing the new account.

Please do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions.

Kind Regards,
Andrea
