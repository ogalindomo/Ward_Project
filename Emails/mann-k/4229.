We are contemplating selling the Blue Dog turbines to NorthWestern.  I've 
been out of town with a sick dad, so I'm not clear who has been in the loop 
and who hasn't.  However, since these are TurboPark turbines, I wanted to 
make sure you are aware of the deal.  It is the commercial teams desire to 
enter into an exclusivity arrangement as soon as possible.  

Sorry for the short notice - today is the first day I've been able to pick up 
my email.

Subject: Revised Exclusivity Letter


Ben and Chris, after discussion with certain members of NorthWestern's
senior management, NorthWestern is offering Enron a $1.0 million
non-refundable payment in exchange for exclusivity until April 6, 2001.  In
effect, this brings the total purchase price for the two GE turbines to
$49.0 million.  The offer is subject to the terms of the attached
Exclusivity Letter.  Please call me as soon as you have reviewed to discuss
the timing considerations.
