When reviewing the blackline of the CA Energy Development/ABB Facility
Agreement, please be aware that we had to remove the blacklining from
Exhibit C in order for us to be able to save and transmit the document.
Thus, Exhibit C shows only the guaranteed delivery date for the one Unit
acquired under the Agreement and not the remainder of the Units acquired
under the original West LB Agreement.
