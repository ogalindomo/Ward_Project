Kay--here is the clean one.  A word of warning--for some reason, if you use 
"tools" "track changes" in word to mark your new changes, it will mark all 
changes going back to the original Santee Cooper form we started with for 
this.  That's why I used Comparerite.  If you don't have Comparerite (it's a 
Lexis program, I think), email the new clean version to me and I can then run 
the program and send it out for you.

I would still like to talk to you when you have a moment and find out how the 
meeting went. Thanks.
