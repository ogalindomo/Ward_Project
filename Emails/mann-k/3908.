We will be in Bay City on Saturday,  but I don't know if it will be overnight.

Subject: This Weekend

Hey,

What is y'alls plan for the weekend? Are dog(s) going with you or staying
with me? Just curious so I can try to figure out what I'll do...It probably
won't be much, but oh well! Thanks!

Love,

Paige
