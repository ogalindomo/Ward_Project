Unit 1 Guaranteed Delivery Dates:     (Exhibit B-2 Schedule I)
 Turbine and Generator   11 March 2001
 Remaining Major Components  31 March 2001  

Delivery Liquidated Damages      (Section 10.3)
 Major Component   $14,500/day  (Exhibit B-6)

Calculation of Delivery Liquidated Damages:

As of May 1, 2001, the air filter housing (defined as a Major Component) for 
Unit 1 has not yet been delivered, hence the Delivery Liquidated Damage clock 
has been running for 31 days.

(31 days) x ($14,500/day) = $449,500.00 towards a cap of 10% of the Purchase 
Amount (10% of $39,103,201 = $3,910,320)
