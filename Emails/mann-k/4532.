I didn't pick this email up until this am, and I don't have the beginnings of 
the 2nd draft with me.  Will DF be in today?

Subject: Second Draft

Kay,

David was unable to pickup the first draft via email--I just sent it to his 
house.  He should arrive in Houston sometime later tonight.  Would you please 
email the second draft to him at home?  (fairleyd@pipeline.com)

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thank you,

Reagan
