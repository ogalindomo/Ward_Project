Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Ciao,


 Mike
