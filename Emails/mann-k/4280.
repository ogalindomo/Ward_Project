It was operator error.  Do you know the hours of summer camp?  I put a call 
in to ask, just in case you didn't know.  I kinda like the Methodist angle, 
and the swimming pool.  He needs more swimming lessons.

Could you re-send that summer camp website address?  The one I got on the
page didn't work.

Thanks,
