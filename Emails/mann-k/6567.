I've answered all their questions, and have suggested to Chris that he ask 
NorthWestern for audited financials.  Marissa is preparing a letter which 
briefly outlines the deal, since GE had requested a letter identifying the 
parties, the payment obligations, etc.  I've given them all this information 
previously in phone calls and by email, but I think they want something 
official looking.  Probably be a good idea for you to sign the letter.

I don't think they will trade payment for a consent, but I could be wrong.  
It just isn't enough money, and GE isn't strapped for cash anyway.  I'd want 
to be careful that we don't trip up on E - Next obligations.

I'd like to hold payment on this invoice until we receive the consent from 
GE. Any update?

The Turbopark funds request for all payments to be made next month needs to 
be submitted by Tuesday, June 12th.  This request covers the period from June 
15th to July 15th.  Are we planning to pay the $1.5 MM invoice from GE during 
this time period?  If so, I will have accounting request the funds.  If we're 
not sure if the payment will be made or not, it is better not to request the 
funds.  In this case, the payment can be treated as an "actual" for that 
month and backed out of the advance for next month.  Please let me know which 
course of action you would like to take.  

Thanks,
Rebecca
