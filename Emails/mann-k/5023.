Subject: RE: GE and ABB comments  

DO NOT PUT THE CONTRACTOR COMMENTS IN THE B/O CONTRACTS.

I sent a copy to Lee Johnson when first received.  I asked Lee if the 
comments had any merit.  (Mostly pertaining to scope of supply comments.)  I 
have not heard back from Lee.

I would expect Lee to let me know if any of the comments would have needed to 
be incorporated.
