Since Chris Booth is out of the office, Ben Jacoby has asked me to coordinate 
sending you the executed originals for Blue Dog Change Orders # 1 and # 2.  I 
have retained one set of originals for our records, and I am sending the 
other set of originals to you via Fed Ex tonight.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, feel free to contact me at 713-345-7968.

Regards,
Rebecca Walker
