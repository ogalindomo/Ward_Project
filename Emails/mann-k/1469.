1.  Calpine/PG&E--We are definitely going to need your accounting memo by 
tomorrow.  Calpine contacted me yesterday for an update.

2.  Fuel Cells Deal--If ENA executes a purchase order with a fuel cell 
manufacturer and from the purchaser's perspective, that purchase order is 
contingent upon 1) a government agency raising a certain amount of funding 
and 2) a government agency accepting full assignment of the purchase order, 
will signing the purchase order create any balance sheet issues to ENA?
