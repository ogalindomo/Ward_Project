Brett:

As promised, attached please find a draft ESA option agreement. FYI, I also 
met with John Ayres this morning to discuss the transformers, and provided 
him copies of the transformer option agreements.

Please let me know who will be handling your comments, if any, on the 
attached agreement.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,


Ben
