Ben,

I am reviewing your draft amendment with Audrey.  We have serious concerns
about the security note.  The form of the AES Corp guarantee providing
security relating to the original agreements should be all that's
required.  We have a few other comments too.

Would like to have a conference call for all interested parties as soon as
possible to resolve this.

I suggest 11:00AM  E.  Call-in # 1-800-747-5150, Access code 5584873.
Next alternative time would be 3:00PM ET.
