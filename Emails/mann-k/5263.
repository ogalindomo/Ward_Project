We do not have any special language prepared by our legal department for 
munies.  We have sent out some special language on confirmations, but the 
language was from the counterparty.  It was not prepared by our legal 
department.

There are no riders.  Elizabeth or Janice may be able to help you with muni 
language.  I will ask Sharen on Monday (confirm queen) if she is aware of any 
muni language that she has used in the past.

Many thanks.  Pardon my ignorance, but is there a list of riders to select 
from? The transaction that we are contemplating is with a municipality, so we 
need some muny language if such thing exists.

Thanks,

Kay
