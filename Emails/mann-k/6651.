Is today Paige's birthday or tomorrow.  Of course if it was great news, then 
it could be a celebratory drink.  I told Ric I may come by for a drink, but I 
didn't know yet.  I think I'll call and get exact directions.

Do you need this fax I got from King and Spalding with comments on Midway?

No news today.  I don't want to know today, as I'm drinking champagne and 
ignoring the issue,
