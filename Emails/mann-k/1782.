Attached below please find a revised, red-lined version of the Request to 
Reopen Proceedings by CRRA.  The changes reflect comments received by Scott 
Healy.

Sandra -- you should have everything from me now expect for the Heat Rate 
Degradation Curve (that will go under Environmental Benefits) and possibly an 
updated Emissions Chart.  I will  forward these items to you as soon as 
possible on Monday.

Regards,

Heather
