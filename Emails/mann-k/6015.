I sent it to them again with a note.  I'll check on it again.  We may have to 
get mean!

Did you ever hear about this matter?

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,
