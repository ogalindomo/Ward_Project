As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=
. =20
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=
e=20
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the=
=20
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of=20
August 8th less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge. =20
Enron=01,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corpora=
te=20
match). ENA=01,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressiv=
e=20
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, =
we=20
can easily surpass these goals.=20

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=
%=20
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has=20
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the=
=20
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a=20
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this yea=
r=20
than last year.  Given the fact that Enron executives are highly compensate=
d=20
with generous options and bonus program, I encourage each of you to become =
a=20
member of the "Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of=
=20
your annual salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your=20
pledge this year, regardless of your level of giving last year.
=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=
=20
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across=
=20
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=
=20
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our=20
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your=20
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our=20
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and=20
getting your pledges in by August 9th.
