The prior e-mail did not transmit well.  Please enter your availability on
the attached spreadsheet.  Ideally I'd like to be able to finalize the
meeting dates by close of business tomorrow, Feb 16.

Folks -

Scheduling a meeting time is becoming nightmarish.  Feb 19th and 20th are no
longer possible.  In the following chart, please indicate your available
dates and e-mail back to me as soon as possible.

Hopefully, building a power plant will be easier than coordinating
schedules.
