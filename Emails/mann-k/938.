Per your request, for further requirements of ENA, attached is the most 
recent off balance sheet (West LB) turbine purchase contract executed between 
EECC and GE.  Although it includes guarantees for a steam turbine also, this 
language can be easily removed.  There are currently a handfull of provisions 
that both EECC and ENA legal, commercial and technical representatives are 
negotiating achieve broad based acceptability under the guidance of Sheila 
Tweed, that GE and Enron both will insist be incorporated into the future 
agreements.  The majority of the provisions in this contract will require 
little or no modification for use in the purchase of a gas turbine for a U.S. 
based project.  The portion of the executed contract that is not attached, 
and is arguably the most important, is the equipment specification.  Although 
a fairly standardized, abridged specification, the detailed project specific 
requirements are provide the level of clarity that is essential to 
understanding the scope to be supplied and integral to the guaranteed 
performance required in the Contract.  This docuement is currently drafted in 
WordPerfect, but is to be issued in Word going forward.   If you have 
questions or require assistance, please let me know.
