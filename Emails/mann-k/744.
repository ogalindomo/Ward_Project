Feels funny emailing someone so close.  I'm addicted to email, however,

I saw Gregg in the elevator lobby as the door was closing.  I'm going to see 
if I can corner him while he is in town to see what is going on.  I'm not 
up-to-speed on this one.

Sara,

Maybe a conference call with Gregg would be the most productive way to go.

Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding 
Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation 
by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, 
whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge 
agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).  
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..
Thanks.  Sara

Greg:  I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately.
