Tony, Chris and Herb,

 I have attached two documents for your convenience.  The first document is 
ENA's list of comments on the Purchase Order Agreement.  The second document 
is a commercial issues list which needs attention.  Please review both of 
these documents as ENA would like to discuss and review the information 
contained in these documents during tomorrow's conference call (starting at 9 
am EST).  Take care.  

    

Regards,
