Let me see what I can figure out today.  I wish they would have given us more 
notice!  This is ridiculous!  I'm not too happy right now about this.

Since I'm "off" today and Friday, and scheduled to be in Fla on Monday, AND 
without you, I'm not in much better shape.  You know I've kept all my files 
on email.  I was hoping there would be a way to move them to a Word file of 
something.  Otherwise, I guess I'm going to have to ask you to start printing 
- highly inefficient.  I can't do it here, though.
