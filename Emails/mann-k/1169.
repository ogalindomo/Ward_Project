1-Is there anything left to do to change the name under the LLC agreement to 
enovate?
   2-I am attaching the overview cash protocol that was discussed during our 
meeting with Treasury, Accounting and Finance.  Who can begin crafting a 
services agreement around this template?  

That's it for this moment.

Thanks,

Gregg
