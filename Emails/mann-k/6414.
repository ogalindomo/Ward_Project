Nothing special from my end but I do expect that we will have the call at the 
regular time.

Thanks.

Anything special for this week's call.  Please let me know so I can send out 
a confirmation email.  Thanks.

YES.  Please ask Kay and/or Scott Dieball for direction.  I'm going into 
hostage mode in Denver tomorrow morning.
