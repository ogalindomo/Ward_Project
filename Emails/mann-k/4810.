Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any
and all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date.
The final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.

Also, Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to
site conditions.  I added language to Exhibit A-1.

Both of these edits are from the CA form.
