You are welcome.
I left a message for Mrs. Norris asking her to call me...I know Michael has
a white s/s shirt. I will let you know what I hear. Love, NM

I'll be in meetings in and out of the office until around noon.

I sure would like to get out of here by 600 tonight.  Wish me luck!

Thanks for putting the dogs out and taking Michael to school.  Sorry about
the doggie accident.  It will take time.

I checked the kindergarten website, but it didn't have any info re Wear
White Day.  I can pretty well figure out what he is supposed to wear
(white), but I'm not sure why.  I believe the 19th is MLK's real birthday,
if that has any significance.  That's not much info, I know...

Hope you have a good day.
