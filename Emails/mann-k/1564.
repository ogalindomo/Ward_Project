Genpower has on Change Order on each of the two Contracts pending, for 
$133,000 on each.  The CO has been fully approved, but I have not been able 
to catch up with the paper work to get it signed by Enron.  It has been 
passed back and forth between NEPCO and GE for edits.  Last I heard, GE had 
signed it and would send it to me.  That was 10 days ago.
