Early this week I circulated the attached summary of the LM 6000 contract to 
the commercial people for comments.  Having received none, the summary is 
apparently OK from a commercial standpoint.

Does either of you see any problem with placing this summary, together with 
copies of the schedules and exhibits to the GE contract (other than exhibits 
and schedules containing price terms or references to spare parts) in the 
data room for Las Vegas?

Hope you had a good weekend.

Thanks.
