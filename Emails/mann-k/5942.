I don't know if you gain anything - the land can be on b/s without putting 
the entire project on b/s, per Herman and Mary Cilia.  My guess is that we'd 
consolidate the other LLC anyway - so the accounting treatment of the land 
would not change by changing the owner of the land, I don't think.

Question for the team:

If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance 
sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the 
project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?  

If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with 
some low dollar hard costs?  I don't have anything in particular in mind, it 
is more of a theoretical question.

Thanks,

Kay
