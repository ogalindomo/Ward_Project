Attached is the revised ABB agreement.  Exhibit B1-44 through Exhibit B1-87 
were the irrelevant data sheets that were deleted.  This is the document 
signed by ABB.

The ABB and GE agreements for CAED were signed by ABB and GE.  There was a 
revision to the ABB agreement (deleting irrelevant data sheets) that Kathleen 
Carnahan will send to you.

Thanks for all your work on these.  We are definitely making progress.
