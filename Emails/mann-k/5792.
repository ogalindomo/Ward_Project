Subject: World Hunger- Section 9.6 Additional tests


Per the conference call of Wednesday, I revised Section 9.6 (with Scott
fixing my drafting).  Attached document contains a redline of the
section.

I think this can be included in the version that goes to GE.  I
discussed
the concept with Jim Sutherland- he agreed with relaxing the unilateral
requirement in the case of GE.  We would not want to do this in the case
of
other vendors.
