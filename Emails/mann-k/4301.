Hi there,

I participated in an FFA auction with Matagorda County Fair, and gave my
assistant the receipts to fill out the matching forms.  Unfortunately, she
has since had surgery and isn't in the office.  The receipts are no longer
on her desk, and the current temporary assistant doesn't know anything
about it.  I was wondering whether a prior temp might have sent them in.
Please let me know.

Thanks,

Kay Mann
