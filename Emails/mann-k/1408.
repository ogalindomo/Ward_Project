Attached are the draft termsheets, substantially in the form that Ranabir 
presented to Peoples, being used in connection with the Manlove transaction.
As you can see, I received them on Wednesday.  I am sure there is an attorney 
in ENA who would gladly spend time reviewing gas storage docs.  We need to 
talk re: staffing etc. early next week.  Give me a call.
