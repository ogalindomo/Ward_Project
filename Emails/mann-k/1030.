My fax number is 63491.

FYI, I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality 
provisions of those contracts.  In fact, I would  like to get a copy of the 
501 D contract (I have the GE contract).  Do you have a copy of the entire 
thing?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I have that information, provided by EECC and reviewed by Ben J and Jeffrey 
K.  If you are somewhere where I can fax it to you or bring you a copy, let 
me know.

Hi Guys,

I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine 
contracts.  Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to 
Allyson?

Thanks,

Kay
