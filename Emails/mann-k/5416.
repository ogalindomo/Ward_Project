Attached please find a very rough first cut of a proposal letter outlining a 
proposal format that we are likely to submit to NiMO on Tuesday 5/8 (due 10 
AM eastern).   Please have a read through and provide me any comments or 
feedback.   We will be finalizing our indicative numbers for the proposal on 
Monday, so any feedback would be appreciated no later than noon on Monday 
(earlier if possible).    thanks 

John

P.S. please forward to anyone i migth have missed
