Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (second
document below) that provides notices to Enron North America, as agent
for E-Next Generation, and changes to the signature blocks.  Also
attached is a blackline (first document below) showing changes made to
the version circulated on April 10. Pursuant to instructions received
from Kay Mann and Bill Williams, this version does not contain the
contractor's comments.  To complete the agreement, we will need to
insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
