Hi Karen,

Sorry I haven't sent the notice.  Brain cramp or something.



When are you here next week?

Kay

Dale's probably a likely suspect.  Any luck finding your form of notice to 
exercise option to take down the equipment??  Please share if it's handy!  
Thanks. 

I'll be in Houston next week;  I'll find you to say hi.
