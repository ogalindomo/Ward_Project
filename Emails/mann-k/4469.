Subject: Re: REMINDER - CONFERENCE CALL - Wednesday - MHI Turbine Contract  

I have a conflicting call at that time tomorrow, thus, I will not be able to 
participate.  Nevertheless, the one issue that I would suggest that be 
discussed is Mike Coleman's technical review of how the contract will need to 
be revised.
