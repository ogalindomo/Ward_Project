In our discussions regarding the Purchaser's remedies in the event of Seller 
default, we discussed the need for language providing for a refund of 
progress payments made paid in addition to cover damages if the equipment is 
not delivered or the Purchaser elects not to take it.  Attached is the 
language used for the East Coast Power Linden 6 turbine contract.  While the 
attached language does not all conform to the current template, this may be 
useful.
