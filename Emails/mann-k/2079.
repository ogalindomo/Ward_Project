I've added the equipment description in Schedule 1 and changed the date of 
the agreement to November 30, 2000 (see attached redlined version).
Ben/Eric - can you verify that my unit numbers in Schedule 1 match your list 
of unit numbers?
David - can you sign off on this for accounting?
Once we have sign-off from accounting, we can circulate the document once 
more with Winston & Strawn.  Hopefully it should be in pretty good shape by 
tomorrow.  Thanks,
-Catherine
