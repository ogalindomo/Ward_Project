Subject: Tex-Mex High Voltage DC project -updated inquiry  

I do not think the prior e-mail got through to Kay.


Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with 
the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any 
structuring goals.

Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to 
issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to 
support the ENA work. 

I now understand that someone at ENA/Enron Mexico/Enron Wholesale has signed 
an EPC  contract with ABB for this project.

I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response.

Please clarify if our contractors including engineering services on the 
Texas-Mexico HVDC project are required to be "off-balance" sheet.
