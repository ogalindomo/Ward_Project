Here is change order #2 for Unit #1 for additional storage.  The change order 
needs a little clean up work as some of the items from change order #1 have 
not yet been removed.

Jeff:  Please review and comment on the attached draft Change Order #2 for 
storage of Unit #1.  This draft is being reviewed internally at the same time 
to speed up the process and I reserve the right to address their comments in 
subsequent redrafts.

Scott:  It is my assumption that you will review the Change Order for the 
benefit of EECC legal review requirements.  Let me know if this is not the 
case.
