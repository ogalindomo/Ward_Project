Subject: MEH as a Hub Customer Contract

Jeff,
MEH is requesting to be a Customer of PGL's Hub, to do so we need to execute 
a PALS agreement (see attached).  I believe this is the same document ENA and 
EMW have already executed.

Upon approval,  please review and fax a signed  "authorized" copy to Laura 
Luce for signature.  Our fax number is 312-541-2728.  Legal questions 
regarding the document should be forwarded to PECORP's Simon Halfin 
(312-240-4411).

Thanks You
