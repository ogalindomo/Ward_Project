Subject: DRAFT Editorial: Enron Is Committed to Florida's Energy Future

Here is the latest draft.  Please return your comments to me ASAP.  I would 
like for it to be ready to go tomorrow (Wednesday, May 30).  We need to give 
time for the newspapers to run it.  Best estimate is 7-10 days, if they 
choose to run it.

Eric
