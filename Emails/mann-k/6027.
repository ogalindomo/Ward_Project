On Friday, I will be at home.  One of my sons graduates on Saturday, so we 
have a house full of relatives starting Friday.  I'm not sure if I'm going to 
be in the office on Monday all day or partial day. In any case, if anybody 
needs anything, don't hesitate to call me at home or on the cell phone or via 
home e-mail.

In the meantime, I will e-mail the info requested and other updates to you.

Thanks and have a good weekend -- David
