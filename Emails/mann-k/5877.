If Carlos has reviewed it I don't need to comment.

Subject: Mirant Americas Development, Inc. CA

Kay,

Attached is a redline of a CA between Mirant and ENA showing Mirant's 
proposed changes.  Please let me know what you think about Paragraph 9 (Re: 
Securities Laws).  Carlos is okay with everything, but had some comments 
about Paragraph 9 as well.

The CA is for Ben Jacoby and he is anxiously awaiting (not to be confused 
with "patiently") legal's comments.  
Thanks

Kathleen
