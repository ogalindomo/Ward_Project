Here you go.  It's pretty specific to the Pastoria contract, but has been 
blessed by Mike Barnas (subject, of course, to GE getting what they want on a 
guaranty!!!  grrrr).

Hi Karen,

Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for 
Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of 
TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.

Thanks,

Kay
