Subject: Documents

Hey, what happened to those docs that you said had to be fed exd to Legner?  
I've written his address and put it in my red book for the temporary in case 
you need her to send them out.  I've also got an extra copy of his address 
for me just in case we need it.  Just thought I'd let you know.
