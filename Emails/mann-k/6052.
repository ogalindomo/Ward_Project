Debbie Skinner is sending you a new password.  You will use this for HRonline 
and also IBuyIt.  Let me know if you don't get it or it doesn't work.

Ok, you are going to have to go to HROnline and change the password to the 
one she is sending.  Wait about 10 minutes or so and then go into payables 
and try the new password.  I have Debbie's number if there are any problems.

When I was at the site it said that it had sent a new password to me at 
kay.mann@enron.com.  Didn't get here.  I give up.

Did they actually change it.  If not try your birthyear and then your birthday

19550805 for example.  My birthday is 8/5/55
