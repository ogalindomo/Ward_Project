Please see my comments to the attached GE TPA which John sent out on May 
22nd.  In it Ihave asked John to get Rose Engeldorf's comments on the "Misc 
Reps & Warranties" as I am unsure that they can be provided by E-Next as 
currently drafted.

I look forward to receiving the next turn with my comments incorporated or an 
email sooner if possible addressing the questions I posed therein.  If there 
are any questions of me first, please call.
