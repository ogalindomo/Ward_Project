There are two critical issues to address in interconnect agreements - one
is the inclusion of  a "notice to proceed" concept before obligations are
triggered under the Interconnection Agreement (this effectively renders the
agreement an option) and the inclusion of text that relates to Turbopark,
ie, broad assignment language and providing an alternative form of security
(Turbopark cannot provide such guaranties).
