That's questionable.  

Houston's VP flies up here on Wednesday for 2 days of staff meetings and I
fly to Houston Thursday for staff meetings.  Because Comair is shut down I
have to fly through Atlanta which takes like 2 days to get to Houston.  I
fly back Saturday morning.  So you see, not really that busy, just occupied.
