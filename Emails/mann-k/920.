Lee:

Looks good except I've gotten approval based on unit #19 being delivered on 
May 15, based on our discussion last week. I'm happy to go back, but I think 
the payment schedule should tie to the unit delivery; i.e. either push the 
payment schedule back, or move the unit delivery date forward.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Thanks,

Ben
