Sorry, but the number is 713-792-6840.

And Bev just called to say that we have a donor for today and one for
tomorrow - so the crisis has passed for the moment.

Betty

I talked with Bob Cook, thinking that as he's the organizer of the blood
drives, he might have a name or two of platelet donors.  The two people who
were going to donate Platelets for Michael today "bailed" for various
reasons, and my wife has tapped out her resources for platelet donors and
I've tapped out mine.  Bob suggested you might contact the people on the
prayer list.  What's needed is people with type O blood (either + or -).  If
anyone is able to do so today, that'd be GREAT.  And if tomorrow or some
other day, that would be great also.

If anyone can donate,  please have him/her call my wife, Bev, at 713
972-6840.  That's the number for both Michael's room and the visitor's room
adjacent to  Michael's room.  They should not call there before noon.  If
they want to call before that or late in the evening (we usually leave the
hospital around 9:30 and get home around 10:30), they can call 281 360-5665
and leave a message.

Thanks.

Bob
