Here is a quick, rough draft at a DASH for the MEH revolver.  You had 
indicated that a high level summary should suffice, so that is where I have 
started.  Please indicate where additional information should be included.  I 
didn't want to get too bogged down in the details unless necessary.  I have 
also included the draft cash management policy that I referred to in the 
DASH.  

Any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Gregg
