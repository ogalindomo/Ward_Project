Kay:

I'd like to call Jeff Darst today to discuss the letter he sent on LDs, etc. 
Prior to calling him, though, I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter 
and the acknowledgement and consent. I was wondering if you could provide me 
an electronic copy of the acknowledgement and consent, and a draft letter. 
Let me know when you think you can get to this, and I'll schedule the call 
with Darst accordingly.

Thanks,

Ben
