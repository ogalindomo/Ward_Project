I will be working on both documents

I told him I would work on both (take the Financial Services Agreement as far 
as I could, with him filling treasury info; and the CA).  He has two 
suggestions as to the form of CA and they are:

1. Since Peoples will want our employees to sign a similar agreement can we 
make it sort of Bilateral to include Peoples (for the sake of having two CA's 
per employee).  What do you think about both ENA and Peoples being defined as 
("Protected Party")

2. Would like to have the term until October 4, 2004 if possible. 

What room are you in?  I'm in 511.
