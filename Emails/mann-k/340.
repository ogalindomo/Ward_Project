Attached is a first cut at the Status of the items we discussed at our
meetings last week in Houston.

Our common target is to get this contract review done by labor day so I will
send this out periodically to let everyone know where we stand.  Please send
updates or corrections that need to be made.  I have attached the contact
list for all the GE folks.

Thanks,
