Early morning is full, but I'm free at 10:00 and several hours thereafter.  
Would this be in addition to or in lieu of the 3:30 call?  Also, do you have 
any heads-up re:  what the comments will be?

Thanks.  Heather

What about Wednesday morning to discuss Bracewell's draft of the
intercompany loan agreement?  Kay could you check Heather's availability?
Anyone else that should be included?

Thanks,

Gregg
