Attached is the weekly status update for the business setup of enovate.  I 
have highlighted in yellow those items which had activity this week.   The 
two most significant outstanding items continue to be completion of the Hub 
Agency Agreement and agreement and documentation of the transfer price 
arrangement. Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Gregg
