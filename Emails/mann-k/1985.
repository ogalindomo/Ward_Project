Sounds great to me.  If we need Ben, it will need to be after noon eastern.  
If it is just us chickens anytime after 930 your time is good for me.

Hi guys,

I thought it would be a good idea to come up with an plan of action to get
the facility agreements closed out.  From what I can tell here, the ESA and
City of Austin deals are the most time sensitive.
