Attached for your review is the current draft of the Ft. Pierce term sheet on 
the 5 year toll.  There is still some fine tuning to be done on the 
language.  I will send the Midway term sheet under a separate email.

Subject: Ft. Pierce Term Sheet

Fred,

Here is the Ft. Pierce Term Sheet.  Obviously, I have copied Nick's so there 
may be a few things I have missed.  The main section that I need to you to 
focus on is the Operating Limitations and Energy Scheduling.  I haven't 
changed these at all.  Nick is sending his version of the Midway term sheet.  
We will get you updated prices soon.
