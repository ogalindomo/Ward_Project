I'm going to miss you really badly. Are you sure you want to go to the cool 
air, unwind, sip wine and eat delicious food?  And miss all this???????

Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on 
O.  It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.  It 
should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.  Please go search 
and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.  I started 
making the changes, but got distracted from the task.  
Thanks,

Kay
