The revised draft is attached, revised per Kay's and your comments.  I have 
not re-run a redline, since the differences between the versions were minor 
and essentially spelled out in Kay's and your email.

To whom should I send it (noting of course per your comment in the cover 
letter that we may be adding language regarding an MEH-owned account for 
receiving Hub Shipper payments)?

Thanks!  DT
