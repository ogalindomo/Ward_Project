Jeff and Kay:

I have addressed Kays comments with regard to CO 2:

1. RE: Section 2.6 and Jeff's comment to end Warranty on March 11, 2004.  
Under the Contract, the Primary Warranty period has a sunset date of 36 
months after completion of delivery of each Unit.  If I knew for certain that 
March 11, 2001 that the Unit would be in storage, I would have no problem 
acknowledging that the sunset date would be March 11, 2004.  If we establish 
the storage facility as the Delivery Point, then the Contract language takes 
us to the same point, and I do not have to hold my breath while the train 
moves the CT to the storage facility.  In addition, I want to keep the 
Primary Warranty Period the same for all the parts of the Unit 1, so the 
final delivery to storage should start the clock running for the purposes of 
the Installation Period, deemed Acceptance, and the 36 months sunset date in 
Contract Section 14.1.1, as I have now drafted C.O. 2, Section 2.6.

2. RE: Section 2.11 and Kay's comment that except for the cosmetic 
deterioration we address in C.O. 2, Section 2.4, it seems the language could 
be interpreted that I am letting GE off the hook for all liability when risk 
of damage and loss passes per this section.  I have added clarifying language 
to say that GE does not shed its liability accrued while Unit 1 was under its 
control just because risk of damage and loss passes to someone else for 
transportation to the Site.

Kay and Jeff:  Please let me know if I have properly represented the issues 
and provided satisfactory corrections.
