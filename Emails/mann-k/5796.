GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity

be exclude from the limit of liability.  


This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.

Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position.
