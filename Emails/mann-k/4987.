Needless to say I had a pretty good idea of the location of the bottleneck.  
Otherwise, I would have called you.

Peggy Banczak quit.  She told me herself, so it must be true.

Kay,

I think your memory is correct.  You asked me to get this stuff to Ed, which 
I did.

Subject: GE contracts

In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing 
final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.  I seem to recall that Sheila 
had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA 
Development stuff.   I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.  
There's probably someone with a better memory.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

Kay
