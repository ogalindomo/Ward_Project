THE WINDSOR SUITE or Honeymoon Suite is located on the beachfront and only 
fifty feet from the waters edge with a wrap around fully furnished verandah 
on two sides. The suite is an independent and very private unit with an 
oversized room featuring jungle style whimsical flora and fauna wall frescos 
painted by a renowned local artist. Floor to ceiling louvered windows on 
three sides and air conditioning provide all the cooling you are likely to 
wish for.
