Tremaine:

Since I did not hear back from you yesterday, I wanted to confirm whether,
notwithstanding the language in the signature block of the Incumbency
Certificate, affixing the corporate seal was an absolute requirement by
Citibank.  If so, could you please courier the original Incumbency
Certificate to the attention of Kathleen Carnahan, whose address is set
forth below:

Enron North America
1400 Smith, EB3146D
Houston, Texas 77002

Several of the officers named on the Incumbency Certificate are out of the
office, so it would expedite matters if you could the original was sent back
to Kathleen.  Thanks.

Regards,

Marisa
