Hi Mrs. Mann,
I thought this might be an easier way to communicate in scheduling the ARD
to review Michael's testing.  Please let me know if tomorrow (9-27) at 11:45
will work for you.  I need to offer you at least a five days written notice
of the ARD so if tomorrow will work for you, would you be willing to waive
the  5 days prior notice.  If not, we can schedule the meeting next week.
Thank you.
