Well, I just don't know what to tell you.  If nothing else I think the ball 
was punted to the east.

Kay:

Not a problem on the CAs at all.  I just noticed something in Sheila's 
email.  Sheila indicated she was NOT working the One-eyed Dog CFI assignment, 
but I 

really think she is working on it, because she just had me set up the entity 
to receive the CFI by assignment  (Onondaga Energy Venture, L.L.C.).   

Am I confused?  Just a little dazed, maybe?

I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.  Thanks 
anyway.

The sale of the cash flow interest is a new deal that I am not working on and 
I think that the CA that Fred needs is to cover bidders for the purchase of 
the cash flow interest.  I will get Ed to prepare the CA if you wish.
