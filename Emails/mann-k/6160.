Attached below for everyone's review is suggested redraft of tax provisions 
(Sections 5.2.1-5.2.3) of the std. contract based on our conference call with 
GE and Enron tax folks (Dave and Matt) earlier today.

Steve - Please forward this Email to Dave (if necessary) as I do not have his 
Email address.

Matt - If you have any further comments to the revised text, please give John 
or myself a call so that we can include your thoughts in our conference call 
with GE tomorrow at 1:30 CST.
