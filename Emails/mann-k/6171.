I have begun drafting of the override letter to accompany the GE
Form Agreement.  It is sufficiently different from the LM 6000 deals
that it is taking more time than I had anticipated.  Have you all done
any override letters for other deals such as Coyote? If so, it would
make things move faster since the Coyote agreement was the basis for the
form.
