These are the latest versions of the EPC LOI and Development Agreement for 
the CRRA Fuel Cell Deal. The Development Agreement has been revised since 
this distribution to add back into the arbitration provision the stipulation 
that the arbitrators selected by the parties need not be neutral. Jeff Ader 
had wanted that stipulation deleted, but Richard Sanders objected and said it 
should go back in, and I suggested Jeff discuss with Richard. Don't know 
where that stands. 

More to follow.
