As promised by Jerry Leitman, I am attaching a revised draft (clean and
blacklined) of the Enron/FuelCell Purchase Agreement.  Please be advised
that I am sending this to you at the same time as I am sending it to my
client and as such reserve the right to make additional comments based on my
client's review.
