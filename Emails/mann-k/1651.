Attached is the weekly status update for the business setup of enovate.  I 
have highlighted in yellow those items which had activity this week.  We made 
significant progress this week as the enovate Risk Management Policy was 
approved and should be fully executed either this afternoon or Monday.  
Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Gregg
