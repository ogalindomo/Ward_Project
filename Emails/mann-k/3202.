think about the suggestions.

No.  I apologize. I do not know why it was deleted.

Pete,

I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC
(our
affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the
Fountain
Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for
plants comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in
this case.  Was it deleted intentionally?

Thanks,

Kay
