Kay, note the discrepencies and we will deal with on a case-by-case basis.  I 
think the definition for Ancillary Services in the ESMA is the correct one; 
however, they are pretty close.

Subject: ILA/ESMA conflicts

What is your preference when there is a  conflict between the interim 
agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.  (For instance, the 
definition of ancillary services.)  Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it 
represent the customers' expectations?
