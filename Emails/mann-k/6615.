I talked to Jason and he said we'll still have Lotus Notes and only docs 
30days and younger will be migrated.  You will be able to get to your other 
documents, but it would be good to go ahead and clean off your email as much 
as possible.  Your address book, etc. will be migrated.  I feel so much 
better now.  I was freaking!
