Subject: GE LM-6000 purchase contract for Las Vegas Cogeneration II project

Bill Williams asked me to forward the attached execution form of the LM-6000 
purchase contract.  

The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  I 
understand that we received it from GE, and that it is available only in pdf 
format.

Thanks.
