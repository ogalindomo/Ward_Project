A couple weeks ago I received a call from Karla Hesketh of ABB- she was 
checking on the status of ABB Invoice #  TS 00365 in the amount of $105,104.

The invoice was for heavy hauling of 2 Transformers for the City of Austin 
Tranformerss.

The invoice was sent to   Enron, city of Austin,  14000 Smith Street   #2957E.

I had left a voice mail for you on this- but less descriptive.  

I have a fax copy of the invoice that Karla sent to me today.


Who is the action person on this?
