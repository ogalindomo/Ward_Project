Here is the latest version of the Enron South America Break-Out Turbine
Contract that I received from Rob Taylor.  I am working on a new version
that will incorporate the specific guarantees into the body of the
agreement.  When I send a blackline, I will run it against version 2,
which is the last version that I sent to you.  That way, you'll be able
to see my changes as well as Rob Taylor's changes.
