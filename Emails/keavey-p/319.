To all:

Kathy and I would like to extend our warmest thanks for the stroller/carseat 
(infant SUV) everyone gave us on Tuesday. Kathy was dissapointed she could 
not be here, as she has been ordered bedrest by the OBGyn nazi. She looks 
forward to meeting all of you soon. Again, we really appreciate the gift and 
will use it everyday. 

Thank you,

Craig
