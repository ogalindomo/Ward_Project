I wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for your encouragement and 
donations for my MS150 bike tour this last weekend.  It was so much fun!  
There is no doubt that you're money will be of great help as I stock up with 
pain killers...just kidding.  I will be coming around this week to collect 
the money so that I can send it as soon as possible to those people diagnosed 
with MS.  

If you're writing a check please make it payable to "National Multicple 
Sclerosis Society."

Once again, thanks for all of your support!

Alejandra
