* If I forgot someone and you would like to call a candidate please feel free 
to contact any one of the 5 individuals listed above.

Since candidate cultivation is so important I have assigned members from the 
team to contact each candidate directly.  Even if you leave a voice message 
with a contact phone number that gives the candidate an opportunity to meet 
other members of Enron's UT team.  If you do not feel comfortable answering 
any of the candidates questions feel free to direct them my way.  Also if you 
would like to call more candidates than just one feel free to call as many as 
you would like.

Thank you for your help and support and I want to give a huge thanks to Paul 
Burkhart, Mark Gandy, Webb Jennings, Drew Tingleaf, and Charlie Weldon who 
helped with first round interviews.  As well as Paul Racicot and George 
McCormick who helped with second round interviews.

Lets cultivated these candidates so this season we have 5 out of 5 accepts!
