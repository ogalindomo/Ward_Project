Candidate Cultivation of UT Fall Associates

Tomorrow evening at 7:30pm I have made reservations for Louis 106 to 
congratulate the two UT Fall candidates that accepted Enron's offer.   Also 
invited are the candidates who are first and second years on loan from 
Enron.  If you are available please RSVP to me as soon as possible.

Thank you and I look forward to a successful Spring Season.

Regards,

Kristin
