Thanks Charlie.  Except for Enron, Recruiting has gone very well.  I
guess you can't win them all.  I am waiting for one more offer before I
make a decision.  I will most likely end up in Houston back at El Paso.


If I end up back in Houston, we should grab lunch a couple of times.

Keep in touch.

Congratualtions, Will!  May God bless you and your family.  She's a
beautiful baby.

How is recruiting going?   Any idea where you think you will end up.
I'm
sorry it did not work out at Enron.  I know that you will do well
wherever
you go.


Charlie
