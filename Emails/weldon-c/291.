I got this message for a contractor that might be interested in working with 
us on the lateral.  Steve Thome had good luck with them on a water line and 
wanted to pass the name along.  He also called and mentioned a guy who is 
with an Enron affiliate - Northern Border - and is interested in a pipeline 
spur as well.  His phone number is 303-575-6479.  May be helpful to keep it 
in the Enron family.

Subject: Pipeline Contractors

Rusty,

Here is the contact for our pipeline contractor:

Clark Ashton
Rooney Engineering
1418 Millstream Lane
Salt Lake City, UT 84106

801-463-7981 

Clark is the business development guy.  He is well connected in the power 
industry (he used to work for NEPCo).  I believe Rooney specializes in 
pipeline installation - they certainly are extremely knowledgeable.  I 
suggest you contact Clark to find out more.  

Steve
