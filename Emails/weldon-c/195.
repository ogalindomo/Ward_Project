Charlie,

Large cap growth stock to consider is Concord EFS.   Ticker is CEFT.
Provides
electronic authorization services for purchases, settlement services,
clearing
house operations, and funds transfers.  Steady uptrend over the last three
years
with little sensitivity to  market swings.   Very highly recommended stock
with
10 strong buy recommendations.   EPS growth in 30-40% range, and PEG of
1.5.
Looks like a good stock to dampen volatility while still getting positives
of the
growing e-commerce volume/dollars/transaction numbers.
