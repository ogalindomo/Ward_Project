I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not 
totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.

Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time.

Charlie,  Let me know whether or not you got my email yesterday about
Mardi Gras.  Our system was on the blink so I'm not sure if you received
it.  I hope Melissa is feeling better - Jimmy was up all night throwing
up and having cold chills.  Love, Margaret
