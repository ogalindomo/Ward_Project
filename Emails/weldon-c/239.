Following our Ft. Pierce meeting this morning, Ozzie Pagan's called me and 
requested a "physical basis" offer for the following deal.  This request is 
the answer to the question David Fairley was going to ask the power guys.  
Neither the FGU RFP  nor the current Ft. Pierce supply option will impact the 
deal's need for this offer.   

Term:  (1) 6/02 - 5/03 (the proposed phase 6 in-service date)
  (2) 6/02 - 12/03 (phase 6 delay insurance)

Quantity: 37,000 MMBtu/d (est. based on 200 MW @ 7,700 HR)  

Location: at the plant

If you have any questions, please ask.  

Regards,
Ed
