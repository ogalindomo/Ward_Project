Since Bruce Ferrel, the designated system administrator for Enron, is no
longer with your company I am addressing this issue to you. We obviously
need to change the administrator of the system as soon as possible. In
addition, I have sent over the new appendix's we spoke about yesterday to
your attention.
Today we had a situation where Dick Jenkins (Enron employee)hit a flat GDD
bid at Transco Z-6 for Dec 2000. He actually was logged in under Scott
Hendrickson's ID. Soon after the trade occurred, Mr. Jenkins called and
informed me that he had made a mistake and that he wanted the deal
cancelled. I informed him of the Manifest Error penalty associated with that
step. By the way the penalty associated with a manifest is $15,000. Mr.
Jenkins informed me that he wanted the trade cancelled but would not pay the
fee.
The Amendment to the Subscription Agreement dated June 23, 1999 describes
the Manifest Error process and all fees associated with it. Altra enforces
this language on all subscribers to the system in order to ensure the
integrity of our trading platform.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713-210-8278.


Sincerely,
Scott Coleman
