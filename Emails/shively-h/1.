Wanted to take a minute to thank each of you for your assistance during our 
preparation for the Wholesale Services portion of yesterday's First Quarter 
Earnings Release conference call and today's First Quarter Update in New York.

Much of the data we accumulate facilitates - 

preparation of discussion points for the Earnings Conference call (replay is 
available at www.Enron.com, "Investors" icon); and
preparation of supporting narrative for our Analyst Slide presentation.

For your convenience, a copy of today's New York slide presentation (copy is 
also available at www.Enron.com, "Investors" icon) is included as an 
attachment below.

Thanks again.

David Leboe
