In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race. 
Kind Regards, 
George Dorsey
