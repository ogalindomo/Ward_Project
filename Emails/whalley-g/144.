Gentlemen:
Just a few lines to let you know about my decision to leave my position as 
Vice President and General Manager Latin America and Caribbean at Network 
Associates. I am aware about Enron's current and future expansion plans in 
the IT arena worldwide, and there is no a doubt in my mind that you are in 
need of good telented people to help you growing your overall IT business.

I am attaching to this e-mail a copy of my Resume outlining my qualifications 
for your review and consideration. Please feel free to contact me at 
954-452-0664 should any of you have a questions. Looking forward to talking 
to all of you soon. Best regards, Herbert Arturo Molina
