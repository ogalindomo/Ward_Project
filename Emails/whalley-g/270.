Attached for your information is a memo that we plan to send out to employees 
worldwide Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning discussing the Policy 
Committee's cost saving recommendations.  To the extent there are unique 
aspects of these policies as they apply to your business unit, please follow 
up with a further communication to your employees.  We will send you a list 
of frequently asked questions that deal with systems issues. 

Thank you.

Karen
