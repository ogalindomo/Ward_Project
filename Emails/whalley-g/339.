Our outside Regulatory Counsel has heard that the CPUC will definitely vote 
to suspend direct access on June 28 effective July 1.  We will be working 
through formal comments and informal discussions to clarify the meaning of 
the this suspension.

We are still working to try and modify the Proposed Decisions as they relate 
to the PX Credit receivable, with our primary focus on removing this part of 
the decision from a vote on June 28.

Subject: DA Suspension in California

Mike Day just called to say he has heard the California PUC definitely will 
vote on June 28 to suspend direct access, effective July 1, except for 
written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.    Suspension of DA has 
been identified by the Governor as a necessary prerequisite to bond 
issuance.
