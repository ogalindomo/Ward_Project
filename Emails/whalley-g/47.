Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Energy Co-opportunity (ECO) and Capstone have entered into a
contractual relationship whereby ECO will be a preferred provider of and
will offer Capstone's 30kW microturbine unit to the electric cooperative
industry.  The contract also calls for the purchase of 76 units, which ECO
believes will sell rapidly given the interest indicated by its customers.
