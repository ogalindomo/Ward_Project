Summary:

* Britain's Crown Estate (hereditary possessions of the Royal family)
has granted seventeen UK companies the option to build wind power generation
projects with a potential value of U$2.3 billion on their land.  Wind
turbine sites have been approved for several regions ranging from Scotland
to the south coast of England, however government and regulatory approval
remains necessary for the projects to go ahead.
* BP, together with the government of Spain and the Phillipines, plan
to build a $48 million solar power plant that will deliver electricity to
over 150 villages (400,000 residents) that are isolated in the Phillipines.
The system will be installed in two separate installments, the first of
which is planned for September.
