Dear Valarie and Fran:

  I followed up with Nancy regarding  EPMI-ST-WROCK.  Based on her response, 
the name won't be changed to EPMI-ST-WR but a new book called EPMI-ST-SW-EXT 
will be added.  Do you plan to use that one in the future?  Please let us 
know so that we can adjust other things accordingly.  Thanks.

- Zhiyun

Zhiyun:

We actually can't change the name of books, so we had to create a new book on 
the RisktRAC side called EPMI-ST-WR-EXT.  However to my knowledge I think 
they are still officializing the EPMI-ST-SW-EXT book.

Regarding the list below, I will let you now later today if this will work 
for us.

Thanks for your help.


Nancy
