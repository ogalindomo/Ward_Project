Deal # 539968 legs one and two is presently in the "killed" status.  John 
will let one or all of you know, preferably by email, when you should 
reactivate the deal.  You may have to modify the start date and the deal 
date.  The deal date should match the date the EEI was signed.  And March 8th 
(the start date) will have come and gone by the time (if ) the contract is 
finalized.  

John (mid market) will take origination on this deal.  I believe his orig. 
that will come out of the LTNW book is going to be .75 per mwh.  Please 
confirm the amount with John.  

Also, please connect with Chris Foster, as I believe the orig. will be held 
until the end of March, and then Chris will provide Risk with a comprehensive 
list of all the mid-market origination that needs to be granted from the 
power books, as he did in Feb.
