Hi Stacey,

Zhiyun Yang has given me your e-mail address recently.

I am interested in your company and would like to meet with you to discuss
my background and possibility of joining Enron.  My background is diverse: I
have five years of experience in financial analysis in banking industry and
three years of Risk Management at PacifiCorp.  I also have strong computer
skills and I am a problem solver.  In terms of education, I am pursuing MS
in Decision Analysis at Portland State University.  I am looking for a
position utilizing my analytical and computational skills at a dynamic
company such as Enron.

Thank you for your time and I am looking forward hearing from you.
