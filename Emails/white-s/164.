Stacey,

Please find the attached May monthly power testing questions for our
meeting on Thursday.   As you discussed with Jenn Staton, we will be
reviewing the daily DPR's tomorrow morning to determine the May curve shift
reports that we would like to obtain.  Also, since earnings release has
been tentatively scheduled for July 12th, we would like to review the June
curve shift reports to date and make a portion of our June request now in
order to alleviate some of the burden on your group in July.  Let me know
if this poses any problems.

(See attached file: May Power Questions.doc)

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x56953.

Thank you,

Jennifer
