Marilyn,

In reviewing our dealtest documentation, we noted one additional deal that
was a desk to desk deal.  Please provide the requested documentation (i.e.,
deal ticket, curve, new deals report) for deal 559093.  If this deal is a
desk to desk deal, please let me know and I will select a replacement deal.

Thank you for all your help.  If you have any questions, please call me at
X6-6269.

Jennifer
