I've tested the "schedule" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!
