I think we all decided that COB S/N and NOB S/N should become a basis point 
unto themselves.  Remapping the S/N  has not been thoroughly explored 
regarding implications to existing deals and has not been re-mapped in table 
edit nor has a basis point been created.  Currently COB S/N and COB N/S = R8; 
and NOB S/N = Basis Pt #22 which is also what NOB N/S is mapped as.  We'll 
probably only appreciate the revaluation on a shoulder month basis, but I 
believe it is material.
