Because the real time position manager is whacked out which means that the 
traders' are missing deals with counterparties, we are delayed running the 
P&L.  We've got everyone working on Friday's info., because to run without 
the deals being properly entered will mess up more people for  a longer 
period than if we wait for corrections.  This situation should not exist at 
all, but that's a trader performance issue separate from us, albeit effecting 
us (and you and other groups).

We will alert you when we have an estimate of the final completion.
