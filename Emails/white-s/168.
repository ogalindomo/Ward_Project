Stacey,

We are currently coordinating a time to visit the Portland office.  As you
may already know, we had previously scheduled for next week; however, due
both to the high price of tickets to Portland for next week and to last
week's flood resulting in Mark Meador losing his house, we are attempting
to reschedule.  Jennifer Staton had mentioned to me that you were
attempting to determine whether you should go to Portland with us.  In
order to assist you in the determination process, I have attached a list of
topics that we plan to address (aside from volume management) as part of
our Portland review.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call
me at x56953.

Thank you,

Jennifer
