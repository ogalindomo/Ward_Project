Attached to this email is a report on the
Transmission Constraint Projects in MS Excel
format.

In addition, ERCOT System Planning Technical
Operations staff is currently examining and
preparing three project proposals for review by
ERCOT Stakeholders. These projects are:

Paris-Anna & Anna-NW Carrollton 345 kV Lines
Venus-Liggett 345 kV Line
San Miguel-Laredo-Bates-Edinburgh 345 kV Lines

We are planning on submitting these projects
separately for stakeholder review via TAC and the
ERCOT Board starting in March or April.

ERCOT is leading five regional planning groups
(North, South, Houston, West and Central) to
determine additional actions needed to resolve
transmission constraints.

We hope this information is helpful and your
cooperation in this matter is appreciated.
