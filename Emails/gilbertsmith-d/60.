Attached are the questions I have electronically.  Angela is preparing an 
electronic list of my hard copy questions from market participants and 
commission staff.  The 12 questions in the commission's order I distributed 
over the weekend will be contained in the list Angela is preparing.  I will 
send that as soon as I get it.

I have attached two examples prepared by TXU in response to Commissions 
questions 2,3,4, and 5 of January 5th's set of questions. See attachment 
below.  

I will be getting a copy of the transcripts from the January 5th technical 
workshop this Thursday or Friday.  Many of the questions on the list below 
will be addressed in the transcripts.  To the extent we disagree with the 
responses we will bring these issues back up. I will email these to you when 
I get them.
