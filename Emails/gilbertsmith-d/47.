Happy New Year!  I hope you and your family are all happy and well, and I
just wanted to send a little hello from snowy Boston.

I finished my first semester at Harvard Business School relatively
unscathed.   It's really strange to be a student again!  I am enjoying it,
and am
learning a ridiculous amount, and there is just way too much information to
actually ingest.  It's good fun,
but some of the people are really arrogant!  The people are not as nice as I
thought they would be.
They're all very interesting, but a lot of them are just investment bankers
who want to back into investment banking.
The profs here are fantastic, however, and it's been a very interesting
semester.

I would love to hear about how you're doing, about Enron North America, etc.

What ever happened to the S. Texas wind deal?  You know I am going to keep
asking you about it... I hope that the turbines have ALREADY been built
and you're making tons of money off of them!

All the best, and Happy New Year!
