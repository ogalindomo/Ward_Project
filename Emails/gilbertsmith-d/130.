The PEP system closes on Friday, May 25, 2001. 
?
Our records indicate that one or more of your direct reports has not 
suggested reviewers.   
?
Please encourage your employees to suggest a list of reviewers promptly for 
your approval. 
?
Alternatively, you may select and approve reviewers on your employees' 
behalf.  To do so, log into PEP at http://pep.enron.com and choose 
'Supervisor Services' from the Main Menu to select and approve your 
employees' reviewers.
