Attached please find Evolution Markets COP 6 special report.  I attended the
negotiations with the EMA.  While most reports of the session were negative,
Evolution believes COP 6 was a positive step forward in the negotiating
process.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss the opportunities for
trading greenhouse gas credits, please contact me.
