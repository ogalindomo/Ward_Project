Doug,

Doesn't look like we're going to be able to do anything with this for right
now.  The demand for chemicals has made it necessary to guarantee
production.

Let me know if anything else comes up.

Steve

  Subject: call options for the winter and the spring

  Steve,

  As we discussed, here are my indicative numbers for a $100
daily call for
  the winter and for march and april:

  J/F  $5.00 MWh
  M/A  $4.00 MWh

  These would be for a firm product. I was thinking that if we
could work on
  the structure alittle we could change that to UD with
intraday flexibility.

  Please call me to discuss when you get a chance,

  Take care,

  Doug
