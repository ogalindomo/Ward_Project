Somewhat regretfully, I have decided to resign from ENE.  I have taken a 
position with Raintree Capital located in Houston.  My first day should be 
Wednesday, April 25.  While I have thoroughly enjoyed my nearly three years 
at ENE, the opportunity at Raintree is directly in line with my long term 
professional goals and was an opportunity I could not pass up.  I enjoyed 
working with (or the interaction with) each of you and look forward to 
meeting again in the future.  Please make a note of my new contact 
information and do not hesitate to give me a call.
