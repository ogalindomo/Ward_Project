The map listed in the blow message is NOT the
first pass of CSC ZONES.  It IS the study regions
and associated numbers we used in our anaysis.
You will need this map to help use the other
files.  CSC Zones will be developed with
stackholder input and calcualtion of shift
factors.  Sorry for the miscommunication.  Thanks
Ken D.
