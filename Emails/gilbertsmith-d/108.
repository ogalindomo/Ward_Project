That's right!? I will be joining Global Energy Markets (G.E.M.) as a managing 
director of coal and emissions trading.? Last month, Allegheny Energy 
announced the acquisition of Merrill Lynch's energy trading division, G.E.M., 
for $490 million plus 2% equity interest in Allegheny. The main purpose of 
this transaction is to combine G.E.M's established trading and risk 
management business with Allegheny's substantial portfolio of low cost 
generation. The transaction is expected to close before the end of this 
quarter.? I will be trading and optimizing Allegheny's coal and emissions 
positions.? G.E.M. will continue to be headquartered in Manhattan.? Allegheny 
has a great portfolio of coal and gas generation (approx. 18 million tons of 
coal consumption per year) and has a dynamic five-year plan for further 
growth through acquisition and development (18,000 MW by 2005).? I am 
extremely excited to be back in the 'coal game' and especially to work with 
the deep pool of trading talent at G.E.M.? 

I will be starting my new position as soon as my obligations to Sithe have 
been fulfilled.? In the meantime, I can be reached by cell phone (917 913 
8873) or at home in Manhattan 646 840 1300 (fax 1515) or email?? 
btubaron@aol.com .? I really appreciated the assistance I have received over 
the past several months that has ultimately led to me choosing this 
position.? Thanks to all involved!
