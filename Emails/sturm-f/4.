NERC Staff Directors, TSC and Managers
Just got word from Dave McColloch at DOE that CA ISO called to say they
were going to Stage 3 with the prospect of shedding firm residential
customer load. Problem this time seems to be that others that had been
selling them power have reached their credit limits and won't sell them any
more until they get paid.
