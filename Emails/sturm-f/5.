Hey folks!

Thanksgiving, recruiting, and my Las Vegas trip are now history.  So the 
answer to the constant question, "When are we going to do another Associate 
2000 Happy Hour?" is-  THIS FRIDAY!

A lot of you couldn't make it the last time we tried Midtown Station, so 
we'll give it another try this week.  C'mon by after work and  see all the 
people whose names you have already forgotten.

The holidays are closing on us faster than a Tennessee linebacker on an 
Alabama quarterback.  There aren't too many more opportunities before the end 
of the year, so let's make this one count!

Catch you there.

Take Smith down to Hadley and hang a right.  The bar is a couple of blocks 
down on the left.
