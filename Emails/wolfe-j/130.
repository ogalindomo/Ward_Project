Yes, I am completely recovered. I was just getting ready for the blacks
when I was forced to watch basketball on the last day.

In my NCAA pool I got 6 of the elite 8 and ALL final 4 teams.. that of
course includes my beautiful upset picks of Ariz and Maryland.
However, there is one other guy who has the same remaining bracket
and is 2 pts ahead, so I will not get the $300 for first. But if Mich St
beats
Ariz I get the $100 second place. If Ariz wins it goes to a tiebreaker on
pts
in the final. I have 145 pts, the other guy has 165.

I also won Ellwanger's work pool.
