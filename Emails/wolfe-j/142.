maybe this weekend. Seriously. I will have some free time Sunday, probably.
I have your cell phone # programmed into my phone. Let's try to do it then,
okay?

Josh,
I guess you've been too busy to lace up your basketball shoes and get out
of the office.
It hasn't been too hot out, and I am ready to get back out on the court and
work
on my all-around Webber-esque game.
Also, you should try to get downtown for lunch sometime if you're not too
busy.
Later,

Jason
