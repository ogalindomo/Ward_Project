Like the last round of testing Unify Migration Team members will arrive in 
your areas prior to the start time for your group.  We will walk the are and 
answer questions and call in issues at they are found.

The purpose of this test is to continue to measure Unify's performance on the 
new platform and find new areas for potential improvement before the 
application is delivered into production.  Identifying performance issues at 
this early stage is extremely important to all of us and beneficial to the 
successful completion of our migration efforts.

Lunch is being arranged through your groups administrative assistance.

Attached is the User Test 2 Schedule and the spreadsheets for gathering 
performance information.  

      
If you have questions please contact Tony Dugger (x5-4371), Jill Hopson 
(x5-4839) or myself.
