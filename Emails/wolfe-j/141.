Subject: Gas Performance Testing TODAY - April 5, 2001
Importance: High

The Unify Migration Team would like to thank you for your participation in 
the gas performance test on Wednesday 4/4.  Based on our observations, system 
monitoring, and your feedback we have identified several areas for 
performance improvement.  We have attempted to fix some of these issues and 
need everyone's help again on Thursday 4/5 from Noon until 2:00, to test the 
modifications and identify other areas for improvement.

The purpose of this test is to continue to measure Unify's performance on the 
new platform and find new areas for potential improvement before the 
application is delivered into production.  Identifying performance issues at 
this early stage is extremely important to all of us and beneficial to the 
successful completion of our migration efforts.

Thursday 4/5 Testing Agenda (Same as Wednesday 4/4)

Retest Day 1 Items - Use April 3rd & 4th Gas Day in the Unify2K PT Gas 
database.  Your floor contacts and phone numbers will be the same as Day 1.
  
DO NOT PERFORM TESTS FOR DAY 2 - These activities will be addressed in the 
next round of performance testing beginning 4/18.

Attached are the documents that were distributed in Tuesday's meeting.



Thank you again for all of your help and support.
