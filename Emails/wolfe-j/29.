Attached is a file with the outstanding variances between the income recorded 
on the general ledger and that reflected in the risk profit and loss files.  
Please review those items for your books and make the necessary adjustments 
in the January 2001 files.  If you need additional information on the 
outstanding items please let me know.



Additionally, if you are listed as the book administrator in error please let
