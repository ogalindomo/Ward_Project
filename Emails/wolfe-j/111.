All,

  I put together a spread sheet for the NCAA tournament this year. If you
are interested then I need you to look at the spread sheet and send it back
to me with your picks by no later than Thursday, March 15th at 10:00 AM. We
have decided to put some money where our mouths are so I will also be asking
for $10 from each of you as soon as possible. The scoring rules are at the
bottom of the spread sheet. Feel free to email me with any questions.

Ad Dei Gloriam,
Michael
The Commissioner . . . you can trust!
