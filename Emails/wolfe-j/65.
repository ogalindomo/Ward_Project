Hey!  Beth said I should e-mail you about possible jobs with Enron.  I'm 
locked in at the Capitol through the beginning of June.  We're in the middle 
of Legislative Session and I made a commitment to stay till the end.  I would 
definitely be interested in finding out about working at Enron though.  Any 
details you could provide would be much appreciated.

I told Beth that ya'll should come visit.  I really enjoyed having ya'll live 
so close.  Anyway, I'll talk to you soon!
