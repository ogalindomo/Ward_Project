I apologize. You are not clingy. I guess I was just concerned, b/c I don't
want to repeat what happened last time. That is why I thought we, rather I,
I guess, needed more space. If we start doing things together again right
away, then we start dating again or we have all of the weirdness we had last
time.  I don't mean to come off as having an attitude.
I'm just not terribly strong. I can't switch as fast from dating to friends.
It takes me a while. Meanwhile, I need space to make that adjustment.

I still want to do something for your birthday, because I care about you.
Just understand that it isn't that easy for me.

P.S. Marisha might be my roommate.
