Personnel and organizational information needs at Enron are diverse and 
changing.  It is critical to the success of Enron that this information be 
accurate and reliable.

Please take a minute of your time and go to PeopleFinder and check your 
information. Look for incorrect Cost Centers, current positions, mailstops 
numbers (ours is 3271), misspelled names or change of name, etc.... (Keep in 
mind that PeopleFinder is linked to the PEP system therefore it is very 
important that all your information be accurate for midyear and end of year 
reviews.) 

 If any changes need to be made please forward them to me.  Once we submit  
the correct information,  HR will be notified in order for the changes to be 
made into SAP and eventually into systems like PEP, Expertfinder, etc.  The 
turnaround for these changes is 24 hours.

NOTE:  Assistants can make changes in PeopleFinder, but due to security 
reasons we cannot make any changes in EHRonline.  Those changes can be made 
only by you.

       Thanks in advance for your help,
                  Alex Saldana ext. 57389
