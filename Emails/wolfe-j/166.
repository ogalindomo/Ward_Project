Please mark your calendars for Thursday, May 10 at 2:30PM for a baby shower 
we are giving Tori.  You will be receiving an invitation shortly, but wanted 
everyone to know that I will be collecting money to shop from anyone that 
doesn't want to.   I have her baby registration at my desk if you would like 
to come by and take a look.  If you have any questions, please call me 
x4732.  Thanks.
