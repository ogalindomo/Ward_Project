sorry i didn't get to you this weekend. things have been a little too busy,
had to take care of my girlfriend, etc. maybe if you want to watch some
final four action this weekend we can get together and do that. i think you
have my number, but in case you don't, it's 713-494-7786.

I am completely open. Sunday might be a little better.
My work #: 713-853-0568
cell#: 713-927-7110

Also, if you are up for any NCAA action (if you have been following the
tourney) get in touch.
I am interested in hearing about what you have been up to and how work is
going.
