14.? I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
15.? I will always cherish the initial misconceptions that I had about ?you. 
16.? Thank you.? We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of  
view. 
17.? The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an antist.

30.? Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. 
31.? I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
32.? A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. 
33.? Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? 
34.? Too many freaks, not enough circuses.
