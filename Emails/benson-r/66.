Robert,

A simple "Enron does not believe its load forecasts can be improved" or
"go to ****" would suffice.  Since there was no reply to my previous
email, I have to assume that it wasn't forwarded to the people in Enron
who would know how to use improved accuracy in their trading strategy.
I will try other ways to contact the appropriate people in Enron.
