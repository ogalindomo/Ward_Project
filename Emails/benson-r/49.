Hi All,

As of today, MetaStock has several new functions. The most important new 
feature is the ability to display forward HEAT RATE charts. 
Also, notice that the interface looks different -- this reflects and 
accommodates the new features. The help files (on the left of the applet) 
fully describe and explain all the changes and additions to the program. 

If you have any questions regarding this new version of MetaStock, please 
contact Anna Santucci (x. 34225) for user questions or Mark Symms (x. 33105) 
for technical questions. And, of course, you can ask these questions once you 
log into the MegaWatt Station (the virtual one).
