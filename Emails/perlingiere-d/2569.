		 Subject: Request for Master Natural Gas Agreement


As I mentioned on the phone, our Traders (Tom Carlson and Theresa Cline) and
our management have requested a Master Agreement for the purchase & sale of
Natural Gas (presumably for firm sales) between Enron and Pinnacle West
Capital Corporation, Arizona Public Service's parent company.  As I further
mentioned, our hope is to have this Agreement in place by next week because
our respective traders are poised to start trading under it.

I have attached PinWest's Company Information Sheet which provides certain
background and contact information.

Please email the draft Agreement as soon as possible to our Contract Manager
(Miki.Kolobara@pinnaclewest.com).  Please contact either Miki (602/250-3427)
or me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
