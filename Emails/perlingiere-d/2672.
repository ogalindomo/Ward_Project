Debra and Tammi, I have sent the master agreement to legal and credit for
review.  Have asked for a response by Tuesday.  I have asked Steve Painter
(919-546-3993)to follow to make certain this keeps moving.  Please also
provide a confirmation that shows CP&L instead of FPC as the contracting
party.  Thank you.

Sandra
