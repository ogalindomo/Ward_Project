Yes, I'm going to start doing his deals also...   I'm seeing more than one 
that needs to be revised, can I wait to fix these on Monday?  The East Desk 
is having problems with their tie outs and it would really help if I stop 
changing things.

Terry,

Not sure if you look after James's deals as well as John Singer, but 
hopefully you can help with this.

Could you please look at deals QB6364.1 / 220477 and QB6332.1 / 220477, they 
should match up with James's deals below, but they don't ....?

Do they need to be revised ?

Rgds
Ellen

Attached is Jim's e-mail regarding Cedar Resources deals.  We have a 
disparity.   I will confirm as below unless I hear from you as different.

There were two Cedar Resource deals:

 No. 1   12/1/2000 through 11/30/2002 (two years)  1000/month @ $4.83/dth

 No. 2 12/1/2000 through 11/30/2001 (one year)  1500/month @ $5.30/dth

Hope this helps.

Jim
