Friends, family, and Enron buddies:

Here are the first few pics of my sweet daughter Lindsey.  I emailed them 
from my home PC and they looked hazy when I opened the attachments, so I hope 
you can make things outs (or maybe it is just the laptop I'm using now).  Tim 
and I are getting a digital camera soon so the pics should be better then.  
Hope you enjoy them!  If not, please bear with me as a proud new mother!

Stacey
