Good Morning Debra - I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement
and Special Provisions for your review and consideration.   I anticipate
completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments
to you by Monday.

In addition, I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the
Gas segment of Enron On-Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would
handle this at Enron that we can speak to?  Greatly appreciate your prompt
feedback to this inquiry.

I look forward to your feedback on the GISB.

Regards,

PS- Were you having  phone system problems this morning?   Myself and Credit
were calling in and none of the calls rolled into voice mail (?).
