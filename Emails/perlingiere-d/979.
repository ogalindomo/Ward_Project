Don't forget!  Tomorrow, Wed., Dec. 13th from 5:30 -7:30 is the MAXWELL
MUSEUM ASSOCIATION MEMBERS ONLY SALE!   There will be refreshments, door
prizes, and special tours of the Maxwell's Collections (If you've never
been down there, this is a real treat!) as well as 30% OFF ALL ITEMS EXCEPT
BOOKS.  So if you are looking for special gifts for special people, this is
the place to be.  The UNM Parking Services has agreed not to ticket in the
C lot north of the Museum and the B lot south of the Museum, as well as the

a little holiday festivity!
