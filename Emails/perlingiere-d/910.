Hi Debra.  Here's our first kick at some amendments.  I noticed there was no
specific language regarding events of default.  I have put in a proposed
amendment for it.  Please advise if the proposed amendments work for your
company.

Once you send it back, I can route it to our legal dept for final review.

Thanks.
