Hi everyone!

Thought you might like to know my new email address:
marcella1022000@yahoo.com Yes, I know it is strange,
but there is not much I can do about it. :)

So, far I am doing well adjusting to "big city" life.
The weather is cool and the trees are changing color!
I worked three days this week. It will be quite a
change from my last job, but I think it will be a good
experience and teach me a lot.

Anyway, I can write in more detail when I hear from
each one of you!

Take care,
Marcie
