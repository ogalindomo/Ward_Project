Well everyone,
It's final. As of 4 p.m., Dec. 6, 2000, Susan Avera Roth is finally
divorced. After 20 months of waiting, we were able to negotiate a
settlement. Rachael will continue supervised visitation, but down from 26
hours a month to 8 hours a month!! Everyone is happy it is finally over.
Thank you for all your prayers.

Also, we're having a party at Tawny's Saturday night at 7 p.m. Tawny is
cooking!! Um uum. Please bring drinks, paper goods, salad and French bread.
We're having Italian food. Hope to see you all there. Tawny's address is 211
Palm Lane.

Stay tuned for more details about the Christmas party set for Dec. 16 at the
church in the Singles II classroom.

Love,
Susan
