Morning,

Well, I can't see that I did send it out before which seems odd as we were 
all talking a lot about this deal.
Apologies  -  I'm the goober ! The confirm will be faxed this am.

Hi girls  -  I'm confused, was sure I sent it out when we discussed it last, 
but still says pending legal in my file, I will look into it further tomorrow 
morning.

Well I guess that makes me a double goober!  I just want to make sure a 
confirm was sent to Superior.  I will  generate another GISB for 
execution.       The confirm / or a copy of same should be directed to Bill 
Bombich @ Fax #    715-395-6300, phone 715-395-6288.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
