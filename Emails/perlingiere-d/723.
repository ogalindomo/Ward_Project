Hello, Everyone

The GST language in the GasEDI Standard Contract is being confirmed by a tax
expert. We expect this will be complete within the next day or two, at which
time the GasEDI Standard Contract will be reissued for general use, complete
with a statement of all changes vs the September 7, 2000 version.

In the meantime, I thought you might be interested in the attached article
which appeared in the October 19, 2000, issue of the Daily Oil Bulletin.

Have a great day ... Ian
