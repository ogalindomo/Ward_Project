Debra,

I noticed on one of the Deal #'s listed below, Deal # 231047,  is under the 
counterparty Duke Energy Field Services, Inc. I was wondering if that Deal # 
is a type-o or if it should stand as is, since the subject is dealing with 
Tristar Gas Marketing Company I would think it should be different than what 
is listed? Please let me know.

Thanks,
Corey
