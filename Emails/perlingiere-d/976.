The only transaction I see out there is a long-term Firm transaction (Deal 
#487399, Tagg #Q99410, Transactio Term 12/01/00 - 02/28/01) currently riding 
on the GISB (K#96053067) per the 11/30/00 discussions. Ellen can confirm if a 
confirmation went out & what contract was referenced on the Confirmation. 
Please let us know if we should take any further action.

Thanks!
Cyndie
