Subject: Superior Water Light and Power

Ellen, attached is the GISB previously discussed which needs a confirm.  I 
will e-mail the attached to the customer today.  Can you likewise send the 
confirm?

Cyndie, as discussed please place this in the system in order that Ellen may 
prepare a confirm to Superior.

Thanks for the help guys!
