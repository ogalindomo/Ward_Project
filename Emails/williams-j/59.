Dale -

Yes.  Please hold off on granting access until you hear from us.  At first 
glance, this appears to be a good candidate, but we would like to run all the 
appropriate traps before approval.

Debbie - 

Does 'tentatively approved' mean that we should not grant Tenaska access 
until we hear from you tomorrow?

Hello,

Per my conversation with Doug, I would like to confirm the following credit 
approvals.

-  Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc  has been rejected by credit, but has 
been approved for "view" access only.  

-  Tenaska Marketing Ventures has been approved by credit.

Please reply to confirm, and I will process accordingly.

Thank you,
Andrea
