Jason

I have another counterparty that is interested in doing a gas deal.  They are 
smaller but we are trying to do some gas deals with these smaller 
counterparties so that they will potentially do some power deals with us.

Calgary Winter Club
4611 14 Street NW
Calgary, Alberta 
Canada
TT2K 1J7

Contact person:  Gary Maher
Number:  403-289-5511

I have included the file below which outlines the potential volumes we would 
be looking at with this counterparty.

Give me a call if you have any questions on this.

Regards,

Shawn
