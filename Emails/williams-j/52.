Please direct approval requests through Jay  Williams and copy Debbie and I.  

Southwest Royalties should be rejected due to credit quality and Cross 
Timbers Energy Services, Inc. should not be approved but we would be willing 
to consider Cross Timbers Oil Company.  All purchases should be directly with 
Cross Timbers Oil Company with no transactions with Energy Services.
