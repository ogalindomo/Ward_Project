Hello, my friend Jay W.

I just wanted to say what a great day I am having.  I
am at peace with my surroundings and getting up to go
to work is the highlight of every day, because it
interrupts the nagging sleep that cuts into work time.
I have a constant smile and my cheerfullness is
rubbing off on others.  We are all a happy family.  I
am sure that your life is the same.  I hope that I can
live to be 200 years old and that I am allowed to work
that long, because every second at the office is an
eternity of serene enlightenment.

God Bless you, friend, and peace be with you.
