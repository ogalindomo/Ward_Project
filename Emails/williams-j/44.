Jason,
I received a copy of a referral form that you completed for Virgil Haney.  
However, a copy of his resume was not attached.  Please send me a copy of 
Virgil's resume.  We cannot process this referral without it.  I think that a 
recruiter sent it to me but, I don't know which one.

Thank you,
James A. Collins
