Gentlemen -

Well, even though we still have a Monday Night Football game yet to be 
played, it's not too early to call the winners of Week 1 of the playoffs:

Megaboof XL beats Refugees
Memphis Blues beat Austin Powers


Once again, Ironballs makes an early exit from the playoffs.  The more things 
change, the more they stay the same.  And Michael just unloaded on Yellig.  
Talk about your running start, unlubricated backdoor violations.  Brutal.


So here are the matchups for next week's contests:

Goodfellas vs. Megaboof XL
Postal Crampage vs. Memphis Blues


Good luck to all our remaining competitors.
