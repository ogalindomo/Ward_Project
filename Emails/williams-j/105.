Team -

We are here in Sydney now and it seems as though I will keep my e-mail 
address.  Our physical address is temporary, so it will be a while before I 
can get you an actuallocation where we can be reached.  I can't remember if 
sent our P.O. Box in houston that forwards mail to us, so I'll provide that 
below.  We'll be in touch.

This address forwards mail to us once a week:
PMB 1324
1405 West Clay
Houston, Texas 77019

New office number:
61-2-9229-2337

e-mail will remain the same

G'day -
