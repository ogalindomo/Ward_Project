Crestar Energy Inc. was amalgamated into Gulf Canada Resources Limited, 
effective January 1, 2001.  We currently have financial master agreements 
with both counterparties.  Please see the attached memo regarding the 
existing masters and let us know which agreement should be terminated.

Also, as a reminder, I am attaching a memo from December regarding Southern 
Pacific/Union Pacific merger.  One of these agreements will also need to be 
terminated.

Thanks,
Stephanie
