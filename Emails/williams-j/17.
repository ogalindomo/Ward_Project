Subject: GAS DEAL w/Oregon Steel Mills

Gas team,

Dave Fuller in West Origination is trying to get the credit requirements for 
the following 3 year gas financial deal:

Term:  01/01/2001 thru 12/31/2003
Volumes:  7,500MMBtu/day
ENA pays float (Sumas Inside Ferc)
CP pays fixed ($$$$???)

Since I need to get the fixed price for this deal, hypothectically though, 
the cp is a "credit upfront" customer.  Assuming prevailing market prices, 
what would your estimated Letter of Credit be for the deal above?  I've sent 
a cws to legal for a draft ISDA.

Quick response appreciated.  Please let me know if you need more info to swag 
this L/C.  I would assume that we need lots of cushion should the market tank.

Tracy
