Below please find the language that Mark & I propose for the EnronOnline 
Markets page as well as each commodity "home" page for the web site.  Please 
let us know if it looks like each such page is going to be limited in length 
so that it is not necessary to scroll down to see the entire page.

Your company should not enter into any transaction unless it fully 
understands the potential risks and rewards of that transaction and has 
independently determined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your 
company's objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and 
other relevant circumstances.  Please bear in mind that in providing this web 
site, Enron is acting as a potential arm's length counterparty and not as 
your company's adviser.  For further information, please see Legal and 
Privacy Information [link]

Let us know if this disclaimer language will work.
