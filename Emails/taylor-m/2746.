Attached is a draft of the memo we discussed regarding confirmations.  We are 
still reviewing the draft and may want to make further changes, but wanted to 
get it to you for your review.   We also may need to make some changes as the 
proposal on confirmation practices is clarified.

We look forward to discussing the memo with you.  Best regards.
