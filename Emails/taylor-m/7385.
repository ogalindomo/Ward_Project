I have received a letter from Aquila Energy dated 12/28 notifying ENA of 
Aquila's intention to sell its rights in the ISDA Master Swap Agreement 
between Onondaga Cogeneration L.P. (OCLP) and NIMO.  Aquila also is 
requesting that ENA's waive the 30-day period provided for in Section 6.1 of 
the Cash Flow Interest Agreement between ENA and OCLP.

I have forwarded the original of this letter to Sheila and a copy to each of 
you.  Mark is currently reviewing Aquila Energy's proposed CA.  Once the CA 
form has been agreed upon and executed, Aquila will forward to me the 
relevant Master Swap documents necessary for ENA's evaluation of this 
monetization opportunity.

Call me if you wish to discuss.
