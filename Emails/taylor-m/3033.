Based upon where we stand today in the final implementation of EOL Argentina 
we have agreed upon a formal launch date of October 4th. Please be aware that 
from here in all deadlines and assigned responsibilities must be met. If 
there are any developing issues or potential conflict with the launch date I 
wish to be made aware directly.

On the afternoon of October 4th we will host a formal energy industry kick 
off event in Buenos Aires to establish our initial market momentum. 

Thank you for everyone's assistance and co-operation.
