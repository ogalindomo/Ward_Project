Mark, I've reviewed the latest version of our ISDA forms, and I'd like an 
opportunity to learn by doing if you think that's O.K.  Do you think I could 
get involved in an upcoming Master Agreement, subject, of course, to your 
supervision (or someone else's)?  Let me know what you think.  Thanks -- Bob
