Mark,  It was good seeing you last week in Houston.  You mentioned that Enron 
submitted comments on the CFTC Proposed rulemaking.  I recall seeing a draft 
of our comments but i have not received a copy of the actual comments.  Can 
you send me a copy.  Thanks.

I hope you have a great time in Paris and I look forward to working with you,

Tom
