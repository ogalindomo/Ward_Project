All,

We are intending to launch the EnronOnline Auctions site tonight (Houston 
time).

The site is in near-final form and can be seen at testweb1.eoltest.com.

You will need a User ID for the test database to see this site.

A comprehensive last look by all would be appreciated - please login to the 
site and let me know if you have any issues.

Obviously, due to the extremely tight timeframe, I will need feedback today. 
Text should be as approved by each of you (bits and pieces each), although I 
did make some amendments to some of the instructional text early this morning.



Thanks,

Dave
