This email is in response to today's call to the Enron
Resolution Center ( ECT helpdesk)

Before I have you added to the two necessary VPN groups
to use with the IPASS, I am going to check with Joe Steele
and Executive Support.

There is a helpdesk case #145973 associated with this,
and please feel free to call me with any questions.
