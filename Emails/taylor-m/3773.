Dear Mark:

We are in the process of marketing an ISDA Energy Conference in Houston on
Tuesday, March 6, 2001.  My colleague, Mary Cunningham, spoke with Mark
Haedicke and he advised we ask you for contact names within the industry
that may wish to attend conference.

Last year Enron graciously supplied us with company names to receive our
Energy and Power Derivatives brochure.  However, we found that in order for
the mailing to be completely successful we need a contact name within the
company to receive the brochure.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Liz
