We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure 
about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?  I 
doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are 
usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.

Subject: Friday & Drinks




We still have too much beer left and need your help in getting rid of
it.  You're invited to our house tomorrow, Friday, at 9:00 for drinks
and a pre-JR's get together.  Other beverages will be served if wanted.
 Sorry, Adobe will not deliver their tasty beverage.

Let me know if you and yours can attend.

Gordon
