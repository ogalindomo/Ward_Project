Hi Louise

We haven't yet - I am waiting for Bruce to return from vacation to discuss 
with him.  In the past Bruce has expressed the view that he wants to move 
away from the commission charging methodology.  Tim Jones has recently 
re-iterated MG's desire to maintain commissions as they get $25m from 
commissions p.a.

Will let you know the outcome.

Regards

Amita

How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions?

In fact its the whole thing about them using agreements which are offline?
