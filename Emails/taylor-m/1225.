Earlier today, we extended an invitation for you to renew your free 
subscription to the American Airlines Net SAAver e-mail program.

We apologize that, due to high demand, you may not have been able to access 
AA.com today for subscription renewal. Since we are unable to meet demand at 
this time, we request that you renew your subscription at a later date. 
Please rest assured that your current subscription is valid and will not be 
canceled without another opportunity to renew.

If you were successful in renewing your subscription earlier today, please 
excuse this notice.

Thank you and we apologize,

The AA.com Web Team
