Subject: Counterparties to whom metals products will be available

Hi Guys

Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all 
metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties:

- All companies on new "A" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron 
copper list.doc below)
- All companies on the old "A" list (where we have a PA for the countries 
they are trading from)  (see tif file below)
- All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be 
forwarded as soon as avail)

Please be aware that the companies on the new "A" list may be a subset of the 
companies on the old "A" list.

Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above.

Both "A" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Regards

Amita
