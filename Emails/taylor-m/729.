In response to your note with respect to the above-referenced topic, I agree 
that the GTC should be attached to the confirm as it mirrors our normal 
practice.  However, the confirm itself should not give a period of time for 
objection as these transactions will be agreed to instantaneously.  Also, I 
would be in favor of the GTC being sent with North American power GTC's and I 
understand that is what Kim is intending to do.  As far as the other 
commodities,  I leave those decisions to Mark Taylor,  Alan Aronowitz and 
whoever else needs to be consulted.
