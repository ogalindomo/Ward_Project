Per my phone mail message, I need your help on the following:

1)  The IT persons who are holding the meeting Nov. 16-17 are anxious to meet 
with the
Legal scholar that will be filling you shoes.  Do you have a name?  Would it 
be better  for
us (the IT group and myself) to prepare an agenda of what the person should 
cover?

2)  I forwarded you various questions that the ENA IT group had raises about 
Houstonstreet.com
and PriceQuote.com.  Have you had a chance to review the questions?  This, of 
course, will
become an issue before we know it. 

NOTE: Another heads-up

Did you know EOL is working to allow brokers to do deals online in the name 
of a Counterparty?
In other words, (i) a broker might do a deal online as Dynegy, (ii) ENA will 
confirm the trade as a
telephonic trade between ENA and Dynegy and brokered by X.  The confirmation 
will have no
mention of EOL anywhere.
