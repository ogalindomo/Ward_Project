Mark - Attached is the marked up and clean version of the risk management 
policy I'd like to include in the upcoming BOD meeting - the packages will be 
sent out at the end of this week.  Would you please review the changes at 
your earliest convenience and let me know if you have any comments?  Most 
changes are just verbiage/wording changes.  See section VII where I tried to 
incorporate your comments to clarify employee trading.  If you want to 
expand, feel free.


Thank you,

Cassandra.
