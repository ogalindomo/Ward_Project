Subject: IPE Query

Louise & Dave,

I haven't received anything from the woman at the IPE but I went to legal and 
got a copy of the latest Regulations.  I think the attached covers want you 
want to know but I'm not sure so please let me know if you require any 
further information.

Don't forget I'm not in tomorrow or next week.

Speak to you later
Snickie
