Justin,

I am assuming that there is no reason from a legal perspective to restrict 
access to EnronOnline EnBank Auctions - so we will proceed with setting up 
the user profiles this way (I've already checked with credit).

Please let me know if this is assumption is incorrect and we need to restrict 
access.

Thanks,

Dave
