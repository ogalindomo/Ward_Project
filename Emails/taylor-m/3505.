Mark, our commercial people have reviewed your proposed changes to the first 
of the Canadian EOL Power Products.  As stated in the message below, we are 
fine with those changes.  Also, John addresses your question on price 
modifications.  Doesn't the ISDA already contain language that will allow for 
post-payment adjustments?  I wouldn't have thought we would need to address 
that issue in the long description.

I would suspect that the same changes would flow through to the other two 
product descriptions, as they are all very similar, but would ask that you 
have a look at the other two descriptions and provide any comments on them.

Thanks

Greg

The wording looks fine to me.  As fas the price modifications go, as I said 
before we can extend the payment dates to the end of the month following a 
Determination Period or would put language in the document that enables us to 
settle up after payments in the event a restatement occurs.
