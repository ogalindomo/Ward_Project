Cheryl would have access through IPass.  Have her talk to our floor tech so 
he can explain how it works.

I would like permission to request remote access from home.  I have a 
personal laptop, and it would benefit me greatly to be able to work out of 
the house.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,
