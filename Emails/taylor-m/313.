Good morning everyone,

Thankyou for responding promptly.

I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought 
we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement 
to something reflecting 'Password Application'.  

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is 
obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have 
different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who 
clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one 
is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the 
online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on 
this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite 
simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no 
WHEREAS is a good start.




Regards

Louise
