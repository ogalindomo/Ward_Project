Your EnronOnline Guest Account has been re-activated as requested. You will 
now be able to resume temporary read-only access to EnronOnline.

You also asked if there are any fees that apply to this service.   
EnronOnline can be accessed free of charge. There are no transaction or 
subscription fees. You will need to make your own arrangements with an 
Internet service provider, who may charge you for Internet access. 

In order to apply for transaction status with EnronOnline, your company needs 
to complete a Password Application and Registration Form for a Master User 
account.  Each Master User will be able to grant various levels of access for 
additional users.  I have attached the Password Application for your 
convenience.

We hope you will find that EnronOnline provides an easy and more efficient 
way to do business with Enron. We look forward to transacting with you online.

Thank you again for your interest in EnronOnline.
