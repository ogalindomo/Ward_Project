Attached is the agenda for the JAD (Joint Achievement Development) meeting to 
be
held in Houston on November 16-17.  Note the first group out of the "chute" 
is the legal
departments discussion of the above noted.  I am acting as a facilitator for 
the IT group
and have been chosen to provide a suggested outline for your presentation.

The two main topics should be (i) electronic signatures and (ii) website deal
validation.

Electronic Signatures - With the legalization of electronic signatures on or 
about October 1, 
2000, what is Enron's position on the use of this practice and , in 
particular, can we apply
this practice to cease the confirmation of transactions completed via 
EnronOnline?    

Website Deal Validation - Is the clearing of deals through Commodity Logic a 
viable 
and allowable solution considering the current language of the contracts 
which govern
these trades?

Other possible topics of short mention:

Governing language - The concept has been circulated that Enron will prepare 
only English
language confirmations.  Any truth to that concept?
