Andrea is coming in early for the conference and will be in the office this 
Wednesday.   Based on our conversation a few weeks ago I thought you might 
want the following information on the requirements for a foreign attorney to 
be licensed in Texas.  (I have not mentioned anything to Andrea regarding 
this issue.)  The requirements for a Texas license are set forth in the Texas 
Board of Law Examiners Rule XIII B.

The requirements include:

1.  Having been licensed, for at least five of the last seven years, to 
practice law in the highest court of the foreign nation.
2.  Hold the equivalent of a J.D. degree (Texas requires that the applicant 
must use an approved credential evaluation service to evaluate the applicants 
legal education.)
3.  Meet one of the following:
 A.  Demonstrate that the law of such foreign nation is sufficiently 
comparable to the law of Texas that, in the judgment of the board, it enables 
the foreign attorney to become a competent attorney in Texas without 
additional formal education, or
 B.  hold an L.L.M. from an approved Law School.


The University of Houston offers a general comparative L.L.M. program that is 
open to foreign students.  The program take anywhere from one year to three 
years depending on whether the student is going full time or part time.  
Applicants must present evidence of a high grade point average or class 
standing at the undergraduate law level.

Enron offers educational assistance and will reimburse employees for up to 
90% of the costs of courses and 75% of the costs of required books for 
work-related courses of study.  Reimbursements are made upon successful 
completion of approved courses.

Let me know if you need further information.
