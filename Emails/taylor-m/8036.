hey--
great running into you several months ago at mo mong. couldn't remember when
it was prior to then.
mary ann and i are building a house in west u. have bought a great corner
lot and are excited to finally get to build. have a young architect who is
also excited to build a project more to his natural inclination than he has
done before.
back in the old liddell sapp days i remember you purchasing a casted glass
sculpture. i thought it would be great to have something like that either in
a garden as part of a water element or in a funky guest bathroom a la
phillipe stark.
do you still have any info on the sculptor? or know how i could get in touch
with him?
thanks; let's go grab a sandwich--
