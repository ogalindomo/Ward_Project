Subject: Mieco Inc. Dispute

Attached is a draft letter I have prepared to send to Mieco Inc.'s General 
Counsel.  It responds to Mieco Inc.'s recent inquiries concerning 
EnronOnline's policies and procedures when one party claims a trade has been 
made in error.  I have intentionally made it as short and sweet as possible.  
Let me know your thoughts.  I would like to get the letter out the door by 
the end of the day, if possible.  Thanks.
