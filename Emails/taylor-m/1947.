An e-mail  virus had been passed on to us this morning at ISDA in New York.
It was carried by an e-mail with the subject "I LOVE YOU" and with a file
attachment.  Unfortunately, it has taken our Global Address List and may
have automatically forwarded to some of you.  Please delete the message(s)
immediately and do not open the file attachment.
