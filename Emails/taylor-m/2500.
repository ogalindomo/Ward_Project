Mark,
I ran into Karen Lambert from the global EOL team and she asked me if I had 
heard back from you on the Australia Deemed ISDA issue.  I'm sorry to ask you 
this again, but I need to verify the information that is in the master 
matrix  for EOL trading.

Thanks,

Mark,
I just wanted to follow up with you to see if you had a chance to talk with 
David Minns in Sydney about their Deemed ISDAs.

Thanks,
