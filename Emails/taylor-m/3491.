Mark - I have a couple of questions for you - 

Where do we stand on not confirming EnronOnline deals?  I know we have talked 
about this in the past, but it continues to come up in conversations around 
Commodity Logic, staffing on the confirms desk, etc.
We were reviewing the company names on the PAs, and I was curious as to why 
we have changed some of them to EnronOnline, LLC, but not all of them.  For 
example, most of the European countries and Singapore have Enron Power 
Operations, Ltd as the company name.
I would like to talk to you about Tana - she is doing a very good job for us, 
but she seems to be quite overloaded.  Also, when she is out, all approvals 
come to a halt.  Any thoughts of hiring some help or cross training someone 
else?  
Another thing I would like to talk to you about is the phone confirmation of 
the EnronOnline broker trades with customers.  We are getting a lot of 
concern from the back office because they are not verbally confirming these 
trades today with the customer...  please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Sheri
