Rick Buy asked me to chat with Sally Beck about this and apologized for not 
having consulted with Legal before submitting the report.  He indicated that 
the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized, at 
least in connection with legal documentation, as mandates.  Sally has been 
out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back 
in and explain the origins of these suggestions.

I am just following up as to whether a decision has been made on this 
matter.  Please let me know.  FYI, Greg has now completed his Houston 
secondment and last week completed the ISDA workshop in Toronto.  Mark is 
scheduled for his Houston secondment some time in the fall.
