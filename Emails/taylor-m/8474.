Brent Hendry will be leaving early today (around 4:30 p.m.).

He is also taking a half day vacation (p.m.) this Thursday and Friday.

Swap Group:  Due to Brent's schedule, he will be unable to attend the NYMEX 
seminar "Intro to NYMEX Products" on Thursday, June 7th, from 1:00 p.m.-4:30 
p.m.  If any of you would like to attend in his place, please let me know 
ASAP.  I have heard they are hard to get in to.  The location of seminar is 
1000 Louisiana, 10th Floor.

Thanks!
Becky
