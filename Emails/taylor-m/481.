Unfortunately, I only received your e-mail just now.  I will see what we can 
do.  If the documents are in Word Perfect, it will be fairly easy.  If not, 
it will take quite a bit of word processing work to convert them.  I'll let 
you know.  Can you send me your phone number?  Thanks.

David,

Further to your earlier email I am pleased to attach the following documents 
for
you to draw up blacklined versions of the US versions of the PA and ETA you
distributed earlier:

PA- version 9 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 10
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd
and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

ETA- version 7 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 8
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd
and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

Please use version 10 of the PA and version 8 of the ETA for your blackline 
for
us.

Please let me know if you need an alternate format of document for your 
computer
systems.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, Edmund.
