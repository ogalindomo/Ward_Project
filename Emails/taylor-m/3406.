Mark,

I understand that in Sara's absence, you are the point person in legal to 
approve product descriptions. The attached products are short, simple and for 
internal counterparties only. In order to meet our deadline, the product 
descriptions need to be approved by Wednesday.






Thanks,

W. Stuart
