Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo 
video we can't use.

They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for 
EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all 
videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable.

Kal and legal are chasing.

Subject: Macromedia site of the day-reference to EnronOnline

Hi all;

There is some coverage of Enron Online through a highlighted site of the day 
on Macromedia.  A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one 
of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for 
Enron Online.  This should increase Enron exposure in the techworld as this 
macromedia site is well followed.  Links below.
