We'll be finalising these this week over here with a view to implementing 
them among the credit trading group in London.

As discussed, it makes sense to have the same (or virtually the same) 
procedures in Houston to ensure that confidential information is handled 
uniformly for this purpose.

Please let me have your comments on the procedures (if any) by the end of the 
week, if possible.

Many thanks

Paul

PS I assume you're comfortable with S&C's work on the US GTCs whichare now 
almost finalised - I'll send through final versions
