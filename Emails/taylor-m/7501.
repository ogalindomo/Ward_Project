Mark,

I have revised the financial swap term sheets that you reviewed several weeks 
ago. Could you have a look at these new versions and see if they meet your 
approval? They are for the Originators to use as a basis for their 
discussions with potential counterparties and are not meant to be binding 
documents. Thank you.

--Andrew
