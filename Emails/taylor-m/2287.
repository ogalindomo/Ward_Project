Jon,
Please find attached the items that remained outstanding.

  

I have also completed the remaining information in the table.  This was:

1.  Credit Contacts Numbers
2.  Credit Products:  Bankrupcy Swaps - Digital Payout
3.  Credit Quotes:  Lockhead Martin Corporation, Vodaphone Airtouch plc, 
Intel Corporation

Here the summary



The CD with the voice over will be sent to Kal Shah as soon as we get Thor's 
voice recorded.  As for the weather information, Victoria could you please 
chase up the desk in Houston as Thor needs this information to do the 
European version.  Thanks

 Outstanding Desks
At this stage there is a possibility that Global Coal may want to add a few 
products, but that will not be known until tomorrow.  Let me know if you are 
missing anything, but presumably you now have everything besides the weather 
info.

Best Regards

Suryan
