Mary,


Sarita and I would like to thank you for speaking at the Clearing User 
Meeting on November 16th.  Everyone we have talked
benefited greatly from the information you presented.  Your presentation 
sparked numerous discussions during and after 
the meeting regarding the legal  versus business requirements related to 
confirming web transacted deals.

We are looking forward to the formation of a  legal task force to further 
define and clarify these requirements
