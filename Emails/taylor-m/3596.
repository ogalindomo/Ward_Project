Subject: New Ideas

In Net Works we receive a lot of new ideas from around the organisation which 
need consideration (and some need actioning).  I though it might be a good 
idea if the above group could get together every two weeks and go through the 
ideas.  I currently have quite a few in my inbox.

Would everyone be able to make a meeting on Friday mornings?  Say 8:30 for 30 
minutes max.

Anyone else who should attend?

Louise
