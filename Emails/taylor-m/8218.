Good evening Holly,

The reserved spaces at the Enron Center Garage have not been assigned.

I will make sure Mr. Mark Taylor's name is placed on the reserved waitlist.


Thanks,
Louis Allen

Louis:

I had sent a note to Steve Woods last week regarding this and have not 
received a reply back.

Mark E. Taylor, V.P. and General Counsel (Enron North America) had requested 
a reserved parking spot at the new Enron Center Parking Garage.  He currently 
parks at the Allen Center Garage.

Is it possible he could transfer to the new garage immediately?

Thank you,

Holly Keiser
