Leslie handled the earlier Confidentiality Agreements, is she suppossed to be 
handling these types of requests as well?  What is the game plan for Enron 
Networks legal support?

Attached for your review and comment please find a revised draft of the
Enron/Acta MOU.  Please note that we believe that this MOU (and any subsequent
MOUs or NDAs) should be between a respective party and Enron Networks LLC, and
to not include ENA and EOL as the process to have to explain the transaction 
to
each of the aforementioned Enron groups would delay a transaction 
significantly.

Please call me at X55306 if you need to discuss the MOU or the above comments
further.

Best regards,

Peter Feltman
