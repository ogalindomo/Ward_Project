Justin, we are doing our legal review for the introduction of Enron Online to 
Australia next year. Would you be able to send me a set of the GTC for 
financial power trades in the UK. These will probably be the closest to the 
GTCs we will need to develop for  trading in electricity derivatives in 
Australia.

thanks for your help.
