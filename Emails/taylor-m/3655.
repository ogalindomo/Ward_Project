Dave Forster and I were talking last week concerning the broker agreements 
and Dave had a good suggestion.  If we included language in the commercial 
agreement that makes the broker aknowledge that by clicking on the GTC they 
are agreeing that the contract is similar to the terms and conditions we 
contemplate with the counterparty and that the damages indicated in the GTC 
would prevail in the event of a broken trade.  This will allow us to use the 
current GTC click structure, the GTC liquidated damages and any other terms 
in the GTC we wanted to retain yet not bind them under the other terms of the 
GTC.
