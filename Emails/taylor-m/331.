Dear Justin/Edmund,

Mark Taylor asked me to forward a sample OTC Weather Derivative Confirmation 
in a Deemed ISDA format for use in connection with your On-Line Trading 
Project.  Attached please find a template for a Single Season CDD Cap Option 
Confirmation which we would use with a US Corporate Counterparty with whom no 
ISDA is in place and no credit support is required. 



Please note that is the most "plain vanilla" version we use and depending 
upon the counterparty, it may need credit support language or additional 
representations (if CP is a non-corporate). If the counterparty is foreign, 
we would of course need the appropriate tax annex.   

I imagine this will serve as a starting point. Please let me know if you have 
questions or would like to see confirmations for  other types of weather 
derivatives.

Kind regards, 

Shari
