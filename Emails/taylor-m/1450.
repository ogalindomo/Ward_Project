Just to follow up: Is there any difference form an approval standpoint if the 
reference credits are to be posted on the web or only shown to a specific 
counterparty (as in the case below)?

Subject: Approval of Reference Credit

We are looking at giving an offer for a bankruptcy swap to Reliant Energy for

 Lumen Energy Corporation (Reference Credit)

The tenor of the deal would be April-December 2000 for a value of USD500k-1m.

On a more general note, could we please agree on procedures for approval of 
new reference credits.

Regards

Tomas
