Justin -- Louise would like to also trademark TAKING THE BIG DEAL OUT OF THE 
BIG DEAL and EOL.  We will enter these terms into commerce effective phase II 
launch in the next couple of weeks.  What steps do we need to follow to 
trademark them?  Do these terms need to be registered under EnronOnline 
L.L.C. or Enron Corp.?  I'll ask Mark Holdsworth for the U.S. side.  Thanks.

Kal

In October 1999, we applied to register the marks ENRONONLINE, ENRONONLINE.COM
and PUTTING THE ENERGY INTO E-COMMERCE as (European) Community Trade Marks 
(in the 
name of Enron Corp.

I don't recall any instructions to apply to register TAKING THE BIG DEAL OUT 
OF THE BIG DEAL.
