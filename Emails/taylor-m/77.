There are conflicts for the 2:00 time slot and so many year-end deals taking 
up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule 
for a later date.

Subject: ECT SA Legal Team Meeting

Mark, would it would it be possible to move the meeting to 2 PM Houston time 
today?  If there are schedule conflicts or if a room is not available then 
perhaps we can reschedule it for after the Holidays.
