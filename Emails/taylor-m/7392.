Rob, as you may know, and Mark, as you are already aware, Nora has been 
supporting the effort's of Harry Arora's DealBench team with respect to 
various activities.  (DealBench owns and operates a proprietary electronic 
commerce or Internet site through which various business services may be 
offered, including an online dataroom for due diligence).  One of the 
DealBench members, Tobias Munk, has been speaking with the Freshfields law 
firm regarding the establishing of a business relationship for 2001 whereby 
Freshfields would provide consulting services relating to DealBench's 
activities, as well as business referral services for the utilization of  
DealBench and its myriad of sites/services; Freshfields, in turn, would 
receive a percentage (10%?)  of site license fees paid by customers referred 
to DealBench by Freshfields.

Nora has worked very hard on DealBench matters and, when needed, has called 
on the expertise of Bob Baird and others at  V&E regarding securities, 
regulatory, and IP-type matters  The Commercial Team finds the Freshfields 
proposal  very attractive and would like to pursue.  To that end, in Nora's 
absence, I would like to discuss with you our moving this forward, if 
viable.  Please let me know your availability to discuss during the next 
couple of days.

Thanks.
Jordan
