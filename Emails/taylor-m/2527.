We would like to reschedule our South American Legal Team meeting to 
tomorrow, either at 1:00 p.m. or 3:00 p.m. Houston time.  Which time would be 
better for you?

A quick reply would be most appreciated.  Since it is already so late in the 
day, this will probably be finalized early tomorrow morning.
