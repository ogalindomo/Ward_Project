		 Subject: Pride Day Rate 250IC Confirm

 We received approval from Lavorato to do this transaction. Please check the  
attached confirm. I have removed the language which required COO approval and 
also changed the option premium to $150,000 from $140,000.  Also Pride signed 
the ISDA and faxed over the signature page. How do we or can we  assign a 
date to the ISDA for the confirm?
Thanks for you help!
