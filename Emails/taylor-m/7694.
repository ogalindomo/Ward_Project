		 Subject: Whitewing Presentation--Thursday February 8th from 11am to 1pm

We have arranged for representatives from tax, accounting, commercial, and 
legal to make presentations relating to the purpose, structure, mechanics, 
etc. associated with the Whitewing/Condor deconsolidated affiliate.  I think 
that the more all of us are "conversant" with that structure, it should 
simplify the legal efforts in closing deals---especially in Q4.  To that end, 
please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this 
presentation and please let my assistant, Darlene Forsyth at x37254 , know 
who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and 
order lunch.

Thanks.
Jordan
