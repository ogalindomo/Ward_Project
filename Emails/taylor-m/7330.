Sheila:

I talked with Aquila this morning and indicated that Enron is interested in 
taking a look at the NIMO/Onondaga L.P.  Index Swap Agreement for the purpose 
of evaluating a potential monetization transaction.  Aquila will forward me a 
draft CA for our review.  Once this document is in place, they are prepared 
to send us the Index Swap Agreement(s).

Who is the appropriate Enron attorney to review the CA and handle term 
sheets/Agreements related to the monetization (assuming that we decide to 
proceed)?

Let me know.

Thanks,
Fred
