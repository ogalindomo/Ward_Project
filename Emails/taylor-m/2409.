Mark,

I agree, particularly with respect to countries other than the U.S. where
the law is much murkier.  Bob will be working on this issue.

Rick:

As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation
on electronic signatures.  There is a big need to standardize the approach
with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.
I think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly
make money through a protocol.  Let me know what you think.
