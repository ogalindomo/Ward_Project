I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make 
sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the 
volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce 
megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - 
it wasn't immediately obvious to me.

Subject: Product Long Form Decsriptions


Dave,

Here are the final Long Form Descriptions for the remaining regions (NSW, 
QLD, SA).

The term of the Swaps that will initially be offered via EOL has yet to be 
decided, but I assume we can set those in the Product Manager when we create 
Australian Power Products.
