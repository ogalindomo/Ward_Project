Mark, Tana asked me to send you an e-mail re-summarizing the d/b/a issue.

According to Illinois counsel, there is no quirk in Illinois law that 
mitigates against being able to enforce a contract with a party who signs the 
contract under a registered d/b/a name.   Since we have a copy of the 
company's d/b/a filing certified by the Illinois Secretary of State, we 
should already have everything we need.   In an abundance of caution, we 
could ask the counterparty's corporate secretary to certify that "[actual 
corporate name]" and "[d/b/a name]" are one and the same entity.  But I 
personally think even doing that is overkill -- the Illinois Secretary of 
State is already basically telling us that in the certificate we already have 
in the file.

Feel free to call w/ any comments or questions.
