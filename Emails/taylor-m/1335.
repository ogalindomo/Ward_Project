We are planning to hold a meeting to kick off the Phase 2 project of 
EnronOnline on 3rd March in Houston.  This meeting will focus on the new look 
for the site and content to be added based on our own thoughts and the 
feedback from customers and our own trading desks. 

A more strategic meeting on the direction for EnronOnline will be held later.

An agenda will be sent out at the beginning of next week.  For those outside 
of Houston, copies of all presentations will be sent to you and you can 
participate by phone if you wish.
