Mark,

Please see copies below of the new Nordic financial energy master agreement.  
The contract should by now be posted on the website of the Nordic Association 
of Electricity Traders ('www.naet.org').  I'm in the process of considering 
terms and elections for ECTRIC's Schedule and may need to discuss a few items 
with you (CFTC, etc.).  Please let me know your availability in next week.

Martin
