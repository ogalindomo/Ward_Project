I received a phone call from Nancy Price inquiring as to the necessity of 
executing confirmations for EOL financial trades.  Nancy verified that the 
bulk of the transactions she was referring to were short-dated gas swaps 
(usually 1 month); not power or other commodity based financial deals.  I 
told her that we were looking into the issue of electronic 
signatures/amending masters requiring confirm signatures.  Her info is:  
713-260-8532 and nmprice@duke-energy.com.  By copy of this email, I am asking 
Mark if he can provide update to me.
