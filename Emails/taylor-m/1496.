Bryan,

I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday.

At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for 
EnronOnline.

We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received.

Dave

Subject: Reference credits

After reviewing all of the lists, attached is the list of reference credits
