Vacations are my favorite reason for people not calling me back.? Hope you 
have a great time and that your cell phone never rings.

Talk to you at the end of May -

Sorry I haven't been able to respond.? I have been swamped trying to get 
away for a vacation and in fact am leaving in the morning.? I will have to 
get back to you when I return which will not be until the 22nd.
