Mark - I had lunch with Paul today and he suggested that he is much more 
comfortable with us making prices on many of the names where CA's have been 
signed as long as we are not putting them online but negotiating a one off 
transaction with a counterparty.  Obviously we need to be careful that we are 
not using confidential information and here I feel confident this is the 
case.  Thanks for your assistance.
