Further to our discussion this morning. There is still one item outstanding 
(see attached checklist) .It involves is the trading of other products apart 
from power (ie those not covered by our exempt market declaration). Is there 
a way forward to overcome the restriction on transacting standard weather 
products through EnronOnline?  

For those not familiar with the issue it is summarised in my attached 24 
December 1999  memo under the heading ASIC approvals.
