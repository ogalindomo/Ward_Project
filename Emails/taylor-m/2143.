We have set a target date of June 12 for the Transwestern Auction site to be 
available to customers. At this date, we will need to be publishing ETA's and 
PA's which reference EnronOnline, rather than Enron North America. 

Please advise if you anticipate any difficulties in getting the incorporated 
EnronOnline into place under Enron Corp. with appropriate ETA and PA 
assignments completed by this date.

If it is possible to have things in place sooner, obviously that would give 
us more breathing space. . .

Thanks,

Dave
