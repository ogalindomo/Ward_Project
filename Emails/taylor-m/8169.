Mark,

Further to our discussion as to which licenses might have impact on 3rd party 
stack:

Tibco (which you are already looking at)
Oracle (is suspected to be a problem)
Weblogic
Apache (very low cost - prob. not a big concern)

SSL does not require a license.

I have requested license copies from Carmen Ayala.
