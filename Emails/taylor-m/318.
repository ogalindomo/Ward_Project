Old Father Hood, standing over there as he has been since time out of mind, 
took a couple of human lives the other day.  A young couple,  experienced 
climbers,  roped together,  apparently fell off the north face, over 1000 
feet to death.  The mountain, like the river, takes a few lives every year.  
For some reason, the youthfulness, expertise and extensive previous 
experience of the couple on the mountain and  many other mountains makes the 
whole event seem more tragic.   As we toil  here in our beloved Trading 
Casino entranced by  the radiant splendor of May, admiring the old peak,  
there is now a sense that an angry god lives up there somewhere.--cgy
