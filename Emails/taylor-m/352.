Good morning

I spoke to our lawyer yesterday on how we could possibly help you in the work 
we had done to date.  To be honest the majority of the effort is on the 
European side (due to the multi jurisdictional issues) and we haven't really 
done a lot in the US particularly on a state level.  

Perhaps the most appropriate thing would be for you to give Mark Taylor in 
ECT legal a ring to discuss the work we have done and see if there is 
anything you can get to save duplication.

Louise
