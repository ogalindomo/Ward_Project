I have talked with some of the commercial folks in the Gas Pipeline Group and 
in addition to ElPaso Energy(which I have previously discussed with you)  we 
believe that Wisconsin Gas Company and Wisconsin Electric Power Company 
should be on the restricted entity list.Please call if you have any 
questions.
