My thoughts are.......:

The Terms and Conditions for Use

I would add  the following text at the end of section 4:

For European Union residents: please note that Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limited is authorized to carry on investment business in the United Kingdom 
by the UK Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and had reviewed and 
approved the contents of this website for relevant regulatory purposes. The 
services referred to in this website are intended only for commercial 
enterprises and not for private customers as defined by the rules of SFA. 
Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who would be regarded as 
private customers under the rules of SFA.  For Belgian residents: please note 
that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,). 


The Letter

The following text should be added as a footer:

The contents of this letter has been approved by Enron Europe Finance & 
Trading Limited, a firm authorized by the UK Securities and Futures Authority 
(SFA) to carry on investment business. The services referred to in this
