As many of you may know there was a serious bike accident last Saturday.? A 
drunk driver came off 290 and hit a group of cyclists just finishing the 
Cyfair ride.? Tragically the first rider, Bruce Maughs, was killed.? Three 
other riders, Barbara Carlson and HRTC members Bobby Riggins and Tim Hunt 
were seriously injured.? Bobby is in Ben Taub hospital, and Tim and Barbara 
are in Memorial Hermann Hospital and all have undergone surgery.? Our 
thoughts go out to them, and the family of Bruce Maughs.? According to the 
Harris County Sheriff's Department, the driver is to be charged with 
involuntary manslaughter.
