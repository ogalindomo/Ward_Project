Mark,

With the addition of the ATA and EnronOnline auctions, we will need to 
provide the customers a way to identify to us that they wish only to transact 
on the Auctions. I am thinking the easiest way to do this is with a check box 
on the PA which says "(Optional): This application is for EnronOnline 
Auctions only"

Would this work?

Dave
