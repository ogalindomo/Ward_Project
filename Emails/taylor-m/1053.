Subject: Legal Questions on ETA's




We are attempting to sign-up for full executing capability on Enron-Online.
Our lawyers had some comments on the ETA.  I have attached their comments
and was wondering if you have just this general agreement or execute
modified agreements with certain parties?  Thanks for your help
