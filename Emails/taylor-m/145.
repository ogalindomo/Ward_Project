Jeff:

That sounds like a great idea.  Are there limitations on such meetings?  I 
would think we need to be careful to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Subject: CFTC Chair -- possible nominee

The leading candidate to replace Brooksley Born as CFTC Chair seems to be 
Annette Nazareth (sp?), who is currently at the SEC.  She is a former Wall 
Street lawyer with a good knowledge of the capital markets/derivatives 
business, and others in the industry feel she would be sympathetic to our 
views on regulation of the OTC markets.   She apparantly has the backing of 
the White House and Treasury Department, and she fits the most important 
criteria -- she's willing to take the job.

As she emerges more formally as the nominee, we might think about an Enron or 
Energy Coalition meeting with Ms. Nazareth her to educate her to the 
specifics of our business.  I'll keep you posted on the process.

Jeff
