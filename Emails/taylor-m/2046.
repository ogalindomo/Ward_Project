We're fine with signing a bilateral NDA.  Lets send them our standard 
bilateral NDA, unless their suggestions to the one below are exceptionally 
favorable to us (and we can turn it around immediately).

Thanks in advance,

Rahil,

Would it be ok if we executed this NDA as mutual? Our lawyer has
provided a redlined copy with the changes that would make it mutual.
Otherwise, we don't have an issue with it.

Let me know if there's a problem.
