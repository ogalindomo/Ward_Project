The 3 FERC staffers will be at Dynegy next Tues to observe power and gas 
traders starting at 7 am.  They will then have a presentation from Dynegy's 
online platform person (like our Dave). 

While at Enron Monday afternoon, we will probably have them sit with both 
Kevin (power) and Phillip (gas) after Dave's presentation.
