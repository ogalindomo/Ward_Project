it appears we have no precipitation gtcs - 

from lawyers comments here, all weather matters are referred back to and 
driven from the US where they have never asked for precipitation products to 
be offered. 

Do we take them out?

Plastics and pulp/paper need to fit under financial as there is nothing 
specific for them. (they are all financial products)

m

ps - i assume they are not covered by  the standard 'financial'
