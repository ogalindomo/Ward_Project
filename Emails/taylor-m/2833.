I have created the following new Product Types in the Data Manager:

AUS CDD Swap
AUS HDD Swap
JPN CDD Swap
JPN HDD Swap

These are exactly the same as the existing AUS and JPN Weather Swap Product 
Types which you have previously approved with the exception that they have 
been created with the trading entity as Enron North America and will be 
denominated in USD. The intention is to give the seperate Weather desks the 
ability to transact weather around the clock. The transactions will be 
denominated in the domicile currency, thereby avoiding dual taxation 
consequences.

Please go into the DataManager and offer your respective approval.
