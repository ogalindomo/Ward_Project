Mark, 

I have reviewed and revised the Broker Electronic Trading Agreement and Fee 
Agreement drafts that you last sent to me and attached the revised drafts 
with marked changes.? With a fresh eye, I have identified (and hopefully 
eliminated) some confusion in the use of terms, as described in the attached 
cover memo.? 

Note that some of the highlighted material in these documents reflects your 
original changes.? I made two rounds of changes, that should be set off in 
different colors from yours, and from each other.

Please let me know if you have questions and comments and, when you get a 
chance, the status of the overall effort. 

Many thanks, 

Bob
