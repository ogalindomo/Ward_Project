I am fine (actually prefer!) that Amita handle Europe.  We can somehow share 
ids - we will work this out between us.

I would like Amita to have the ability to add sub-users out of London to 
better service EEL, if that is possible. I still would like you, or your 
designate, to be the master user. does this work ?

Leslie, otherwise it looks good.
