there is...generally, we can transact within our limits, on any of the names 
on EC.com but we will need to run additional names past both the credit and 
legal departments prior to transacting.  when in doubt ask for permission.

Subject: Approval of Reference Credit

Just to follow up: Is there any difference form an approval standpoint if the 
reference credits are to be posted on the web or only shown to a specific 
counterparty (as in the case below)?

Subject: Approval of Reference Credit

We are looking at giving an offer for a bankruptcy swap to Reliant Energy for

 Lumen Energy Corporation (Reference Credit)

The tenor of the deal would be April-December 2000 for a value of USD500k-1m.

On a more general note, could we please agree on procedures for approval of 
new reference credits.

Regards

Tomas
