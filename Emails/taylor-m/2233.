I have attached two documents that describe how to play Minute Mania, and the 
proposed navigation and language for the contest site.  Please add the 
appropriate language that we would like to see, and return comments to me as 
soon as possible so that we can increase the probability of success when we 
see the site for approval Friday morning.

thanks
Dave
