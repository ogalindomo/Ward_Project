Thanks Mark - my understanding however is that the long description with the 
reference to COMEX will be viewable by Reuters users so does this change your 
view or would we still be okay, given that the reference to COMEX is quite 
benign (i.e. we have similar references in our long descriptions for IPE, 
Platts etc.)?
