Attached is the finalized agenda for the May 30th ENW Management Offsite at 
the Houstonian.  Morning traffic is unpredictable in the area, so please 
allow yourself ample time to arrive and settle in before the 8:00 a.m. 
opening comments from Philippe and Greg.

I would also like to remind you that your Powerpoint presentations are due to 
me by 10:00 a.m. for inclusion into the slide show.  If you need any 
assistance with your presentation, please feel free to call me.

Thank you,
