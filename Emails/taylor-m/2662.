Subject: Online docs

Dave,

Here are all the Online docs in both Word and HTML format!  We have not been 
able to put the PAs for Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain onto one page; we 
also had problems the with table in the US Coal GTC.  I suggest that someone 
with Web text editing expertise has a go at them.

I've included the new Canadian Gas GTCs (NIT Gas and Canada Gas) and the 
replacement US Coal GTC. But not, the power GTCs sent over earlier or the 
other US Gas GTCs.  I'm awaiting instruction in accordance with my earlier 
emails.

Thanks Edmund.
