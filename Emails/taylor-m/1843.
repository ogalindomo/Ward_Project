This is the first time I've seen these. Could you call me to discuss on 
Monday to get the background on these documents?

I'll be out tomorrow, but back in on Monday a.m.

Also, Mark and I visited yesterday about the legal checklist you sent to us 
and we have a few additional points to add. We will get you our list early 
next week if that's ok.
