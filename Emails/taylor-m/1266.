Dave, 

Credit Houston received yesterday a partial list of counterparties to whom 
this product should be shown. We are still waiting for a final list of 
reference credits and are trying to confirm with Credit London that they have 
received a list of trading counterparties. Profiles still need to be created 
for all trading counterparties based on the products for EOL.

As of this minute, I would say that we have signed off on the concept but 
details and individual approvals are not complete. Bill spoke with Bryan last 
night and communicated this to him as well.

A Monday launch looks a bit optimistic given the data on hand and tasks left 
to do. Being a US holiday for Enron doesn't help either.

Let me know how things progress from your end.

Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday.

Have you both "signed off" on the process, or are there issues outstanding 
which need to be resolved, from your point of view?

Dave
