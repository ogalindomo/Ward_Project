Dan, here's a couple of files to link to the "library" section of the new 
Plastics & Petchems specific EOL page.
 
By copy to Yvette, could you please forward to Dan the latest version of the 
plastics.enron.com website - this would be the one that you updated the text 
on back in Mar/Apr.  Thanks.
