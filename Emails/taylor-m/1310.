EnronOnline Auctions are now live in the Production database, with EnBank 
virtual storage as the first product offering.

There is a new Auctions button on the bottom of the Quotes screen (replaces 
the old Market Info. button). Please look over the site contents and let me 
know if you spot anything which needs to be edited.

For detailed EnBank questions, please refer customers to the EnBank HelpDesk 
at 011 44 (0) 207 783 7700. All media calls concerning EnBank should be 
directed to Jonathan Whitehead: 011 44 (0) 207 783 6534. Media calls 
concerning EnronOnline Auctions within Enron's broader EnronOnline/e-commerce 
strategy will be handled by myself: 001 713 853 1861.

Many thanks to those who have put in long hours to bring EnBank and the new 
auctions site to fruition in record time.
