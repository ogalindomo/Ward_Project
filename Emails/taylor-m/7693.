Folks,

I would like to have this in place as soon as possible.  We are trying to 
develop liquidity in New York and Amerada Hess may be an important trading 
partner.

Thanks,

Tom.

Subject: Hess ISDA

Mark,

I just received a call from Kelley Lavourne, a trader with Amerada Hess, 
asking me to update him on the ISDA status. He has interest in trading 
financials in New York power via EOL. He was told by his attorneys that you 
were working on it from Enron's end. Kelley wanted to find out if there was 
anything he needs to do on his end to speed up the process. Any update you 
could give me would be appreciated. Thanks.
