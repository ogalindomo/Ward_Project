Here is what the proposed site would look like following the link from the 
EnronOnline quotes screen.  From a commercial and design perspective it looks 
great.  Any legal issues?

Louise raised the idea that we may want to add a disclaimer that the content 
is provided by Sports.com.  I told her that we had an indemnification from 
them with respect to libel, etc.   Please let me know if you think we need to 
add this.

thanks
Dave

Hello Dave
?
Kevin Arrix is currently having problems with his  e:mail at the moment so I 
am contacting you directly with the latest revised  example of the Enron 
co-branded page. I am doing the graphic work on the page so  if there are any 
changes regarding the look -  you can contact me  directly.

Cheers,
