If you will provide me with a copy of Enron's documents which establish its 
hedging policy, I will be happy to get such a policy before the managing 
partners of Bridgeline.  bng

Subject: Bridgeline, LP--Hedging Policy

In light of the aggregation of our and Texaco's Lousiana pipeline assets, it 
would appear necessary (from a tax perspective, as well as for--perhaps-- 
risk managment purposes) for us to adopt a hedging policy so as to ensure we 
get proper tax characterization for our taxable income and losses associated 
with such JV.

I would appreciate your thoughts regarding this point and your suggestions in 
our going forward to implement  this program/ policy.

Jordan
