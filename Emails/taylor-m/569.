Mark,

I've made a few adjustments from the previous spreadsheet.

1)  the US Gas spread products have been pulled--they no longer want to offer 
these. (that problem is solved fairly easily, eh?)

2)  all the weather fallbacks have been entered

3)  the strike prices for HDDs and CDDs are the Bid/Offer amounts...

4)  the indices should be denoted "P" or "F" for physical and financial 
products.


Still unresolved:

1)  A "Strike Price" field--not sure where we are on this, but I should have 
an update for the beginning of the next week.

2)  all of the 'daily settlement fo the arithmetic average' questions have 
not been resolved--the confirm group is handling this 'as we email', so once 
I receive an update from them, I will forward it to you.

Regards,
Andy
