Subject: The EnronOnline Games Results

Attached is a spreadsheet listing the top twenty participants.

Yellow represents Enron Employees
Red represents disqualification due to multiple entries
Blue represents Illinois (a potential problem state for prizing, advice 
received after game commenced).  It is unlikely that this person will place 
in the top five and thus be eligible for a prize. 

Some participant account status have yet to be determined, to achieve this we 
will need to ask potential winners for their EnronOnline login and id 
information. Once account status have been confirmed we can then advise 
winners and have them sign the appropriate release forms before delivering 
the prizes.

The final figures fort the game are:





Cheers
