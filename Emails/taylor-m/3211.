Welcome Back!  

Looks like BP has finally signed.  As I understand it, this should open the 
way to get them signed up in the U.S.

Justin-

Here's the signed letter from BP..... unfortunately she has signed the North 
American Password Application!  So I've left a message for her to phone me 
again.  She'll have to sign the UK version before we'll set her up.
