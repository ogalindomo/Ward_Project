Please speak to Mark Taylor but all final GTCs were sent by him on the 4/5th 
August to my team and are in the process of  been loaded into the system.

I believe that Mark did not receive any language in time as per meeting 
discussion.

Louise/Dave
I wanted to follow up with you regarding the general terms and conditions 
(GTC) for the products to be sold via Enron Online.  Per our memo dated 
August 5, 1999, the GTCs for coal and power products did not include any tax 
language.  For Enron's protection, it is imperative that the appropriate tax 
language be added to these documents.  Please let me know how we can ensure 
the appropriate tax language is in our online GTC's before we go live.
Sandra
