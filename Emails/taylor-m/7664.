Please take a look at the attached agenda, I believe it represents what we 
discussed in our meeting today.  Please let me know as soon as possible if 
you have any question, additions, or deletions.  Furthermore, I am interested 
in opinions on the following points:

1) When should the EnronOnline commercial (?) and technical (Bob Hillier ?) 
contacts be identified and introduced?
2) What is appropriate and not appropriate for Dave Forster to cover in his 
EOL demo?
3) Who from EOL should/could attend dinner with Kiodex on Thursday night?

Thanks for your help.
