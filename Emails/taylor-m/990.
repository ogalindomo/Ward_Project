Attached please find a Weather Long Description, modified pursuant to our 
conversation this morning.
I will change the CDD Product Typre description as well. Also, last week we 
changed the reference to the price quote to remove reference to "per unit of 
volume".

Please review and offer approval/comments.






David:

For your ease of reference, bolding represents additional language; italics 
represents changes.

Should I be changing the Norway and UK components as well, or will that be 
done by PCG London? 
(I am more than happy to do it.)
