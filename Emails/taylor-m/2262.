Dan, here's our first ever market commentary.  I gather the information will 
be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve 
primarily as a place holder in our web page.
From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent "neutral" sources 
(such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ....) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.  
The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin 
that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together.



Thanks,
Alan
