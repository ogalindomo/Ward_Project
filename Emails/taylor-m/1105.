Thanks so much for all the goodies!  We really enjoyed the pictures.  Aren't
cats all alike in wanting to get into enclosures?  I believe that was the
first picture we have seen of her.  We would really like to have a hard copy
of that picture of you.  Can that be done?

The analysts report prompted me to get on the stick and send off some more
money to the direct purchase plan of Enron stock.  The "online trading
platform" that was mentioned in the report--is that what you were involved
in launching and about which you are continuing to answer questions?

We are sending your birthday package to your office by UPS today so you can
start looking for it about Wednesday, I guess.

Love, Mother
