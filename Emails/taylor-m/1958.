Ricardo;

Please be advised that Pinheiro Neto has been engaged as local counsel to 
prepare a memo with respect to the legal framework to implement EOL in 
Brazil.  Lacaz Martins has not been engaged as local counsel to EOL; Lacaz 
Martins has been engaged to act as counsel to a Direct Sales deal.  If you 
want to take advantadge of Lacaz Martins' legal opinion (Direct Sales deal) 
because it will also address an important tax issue under the EOL business, 
please note that Lacaz Martins is not counsel for EOL and Pinheiro Neto would 
have to review such opinion.

Rgds,

Sami
