Subject: Letter to Chairman Ewing

Here is the language I mentioned in my voice mail.  Cynthia Sandherr's office 
should be getting in touch this afternoon with the addresses, forms of 
address, etc.  The letters need to be hand delivered in DC on Monday so they 
need to be fed exed to our DC office tonight.  Please call if you have any 
questions.

Thanks!

Mark
