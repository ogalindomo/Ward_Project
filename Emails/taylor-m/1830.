SENT ON BEHALF OF ROBERT RABALAIS

Here are revisions to the Note as we discussed with Weil Gotshal and
Deutsche Bank.  We have attempted to revise and clarify the provisions
pertaining to the coupon payment and the selection of options.  No
substantive changes resulted from these revisions.  If you have any
questions, please call Robert Rabalais at (713) 758-4526.
