 We have not yet received (and I have checked with Dave) any information with 
regards to the due diligence completed in terms of how this runs through the 
EOL system - eg can Guest Users who will have no transaction status when they 
sign a PA see the numbers?  Do the PA and ETA work for Brankrupcty swaps in 
each of the jurisdictions will see the swaps?  How many of those 
jurisdictions .  These are the issues we are to deal with when you give us 
the due diligence work performed.    We only got the contract today.

I know you spoke to Mark Taylor and believe that you discuss  agreed on the 2 
weeks timing which I assume is why the 8th March appears.  But please let 
Dave know if you want to move the dates radically.  We are purely working on 
2 weeks from receiving the info as long as you think we'll get it 2 weeks 
before the 8th March then we should have no problems with the press release 
below.

Comments on questions
EnronOnline is not a 24 hour system
We don't give out data on numbers of customers on EOL (primarily as its only 
about 200).
