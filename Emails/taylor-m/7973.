Mark,

Attached are two versions of recently executed Termination Agreements.  One 
related to a Master Agreement termination, and the other related to a 
termination of a trade.  The second doc may be what you are looking for, 
being that a provision dealing with a termination payment was included 
therein.

                  


Cordially,
