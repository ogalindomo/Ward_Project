Attached is draft 4 of the Operations and Procedures Policy which David has 
been putting together - this really should highlight all of the issues and 
facilitate understanding - this is not a final document but if your 
understanding differs from what is in the document.  It is imperative you 
repond immediately.  

Thanks
