Subject: New PA form

Mark/Justin,

Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an 
Address for Service.

Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well?

I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the 
relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on 
the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about 
ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed?

Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for 
customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a 
statement like: "(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to 
EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site"  [tick box].

If you wish to proceed with either of the above, we will need to revise all 
PA's and post them on the website.

Thanks,

Dave
