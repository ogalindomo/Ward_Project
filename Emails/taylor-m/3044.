Attached please find the latest version of the Official Rules of the 
EnronOnline Games.  The following steps are necessary to finalize the rules:

1.  Receipt of final advice from LinkLaters re approved jurisdictions.  
Norway and Sweden, and perhaps Italy, are likely to be moved into the 
approved list and can be added to the eligible jurisdictions in the 
Eligibility section.  

2.  Currently, if a participant is not eligible to win a prize, he/she is not 
eligible to win.  However, if you change your minds and decide to open up the 
game to individuals who cannot win prizes, add the following to the Official 
Rules, as well as the Front Page and Registration Page disclaimers:

"Residents of Belgium, [France], [Italy], the Netherlands, [Sweden] . . .  
may participate in the game but are ineligible to win any prizes due to 
regulatory restrictions."    Confirm the list of jurisdictions with 
Linklaters.

3.  There is a section entitled "Scoring System/Point Weightings" that has 
not been completed.  It just says "To be Confirmed."  Please complete this 
section as appropriate.



Unless I notify you that I was unable to finalize the Rules before leaving 
for vacation, Mark Taylor will handle finalizing these Rules.

Regards,

Leslie
