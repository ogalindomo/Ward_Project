There are 2 ways of setting product tenors:

1 - specific, where the start and end dates are selected from drop down 
calendars on the product manager. 

2 - tokenised, where we have set up a record for the period in the database, 
and the rules applicable to it (e.g. Balance of Month, Day ahead) - the rules 
ensure that the specific start and end dates for such a product are shown in 
the product short description. 

Please note that any tokenised periods will need to be set up prior to 
building products in the product manager.
