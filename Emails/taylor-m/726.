Let's go for dinner Monday night.  With any luck I'll be able to get to the 
airport for a plane back to Houston Tues. night.

Yes I am glad it was rescheduled! I am around both days. Want to book a 
dinner?

I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time
other than December.  I guess Monmouth is a little harder to get to than 
Chicago
but it will be nice to see the campus again.

I'm going to be in New York Nov. 1 & 2.  Any chance of getting together?
