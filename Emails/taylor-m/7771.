Mark,

I am interested in opening a personal commodity trading account.  I'm not 
involved in a trading function here at Enron.  My manager Jennifer Fraser 
suggested I write you to find out what steps I need to take to ensure 
compliance before I open the account.

Your guidance on the subject is appreciated.

Thanks, Vikas
