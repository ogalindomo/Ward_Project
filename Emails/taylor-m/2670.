The Weather desk will be offering a Power Financial Product. Besides the fact 
that this Power Product will be managed by the Weather Desk, it is different 
in that it more closely mirrors a Weather transaction, as Weather trading 
will be adjusting the 'Strike Prices' (as opposed to the proces) for these 
power transactions through the Bid and Offer. The Pay Unit is set at 10/MW 
and the Floating Price will equal PJM Demand prices on the PJMs official 
website. The Payment Amount will equal the product of the Notional and the 
ABS of Floating Price - Strike Price.

Please see the Product Long Description attached.
