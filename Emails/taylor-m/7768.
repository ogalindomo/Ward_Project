Looks good, Mark.  Two quick questions/thoughts:
1. In 4., "following the discovery of a material defect shall terminate its 
access..." Why? It probably does not hurt us if they continue to use the 
site, and if it did hurt us, we would have the right to terminate the test as 
per 5.  Do we want the explicit right to temporarily suspend the test, 
anticipating a resumption--less harsh than termination.
2. In 2., can we add words such as "CommodityLogic and User agree that their 
participation in this beta test is confidential.  The identity of the user  
[may]   [may not]  be made known to the other beta users testing in this same 
time period." (User to strike through undesired option.)  

All the best,

Tom
