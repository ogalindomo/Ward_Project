Jon,
Here are more content files from the European Desks.  I have also attached a 
summary sheet with all the information you should have received from us 
(marked in Green).   We still have some stragglers, but they should submit by 
Friday our closing.  I understand Victoria already sent you most of the 
weather information  earlier in the week. 

            




If you have any question please let me know.  
Regards
Suryan
