As you know, the ETA has to address Trade one-to-many with Enron and Match 
one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a separate Trade GTC one-to-many with 
Enron and Separate Match GTC one-to-many with Enron.  We also need a single 
Password application that addresses Match and Trade, both one-to-many.

As soon as these drafts are complete, I would like to read them!

Thanks.

Subject: Electronic Transactions Agreement - revised

Attached is a revised version of the ETA omitting the distinction between 
transactions on Match and transactions on Trade.   If Enron is the only party 
permitted to post product on Match, there is no need for the special rules 
that we drafted for what was previously a "many-to-many" matching site.  
However, we will need to develop a different set of GTCs for transactions 
that Enron closes on Match, since the products transacted on Match are not 
likely to be the type that lend themselves to Enron's standard GTCs.
