Martin / Bryan,

Attached is Martin's list with a column specifying jurisdiction of  
incorporation.  As you can see there are about 15-20 c/ps that I didn't have 
that info for.  Could you forward the list to Credit for them to 'fill in the 
blanks' to aid the lawyers in their review.

If you have any questions let me know.

Thanks, Edmund.
