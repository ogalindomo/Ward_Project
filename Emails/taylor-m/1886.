We have built two new Products Types called US Bandwidth DS3 Physical Forward 
and US Bandwidth OC3 Physical Forward. Please go into DataManager and approve 
these Product Types (look at attached Document).  We are going life on the 
1st of May.  If you need help with the approval process contact Dale Neuner 
(ext. 39746) or myself (ext. 39938). Please Do Not Reject the Product Type. 
If you have questions or changes to the Product Type please contact me at 
your convenience. 

Thank you very much for your co-operation!
