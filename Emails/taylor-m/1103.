Subject: Press Release



Louise -

Please get in touch with me to discuss a press release. Given the
information in the Wall Street Journal, Enron has gone public with the
importance of this work and how it is functioning and we want to 'strike
while the iron is hot' with a followup release from us.

My cell phone is 630 235 1121. I will be in the office all next week. If
I don't pick up my phone, please '0' out and ask the receptionist to
find me.

Thanks,
Dave
