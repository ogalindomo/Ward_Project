ie Mark Taylor

The only concern he had from a legal perspective was that in the Skilling 
quote "Enron as a principle"  - that we might want to change it to "an Enron 
company as a principle". - Minor 

But he does have a point with the line before - remove the "just" as we don't 
actually match buyers and sellers at all.
