Attached is a draft of an Amendment to the ETA for buyers of pipeline
capacity, based on your e-mail and the summary of terms.  Although the
summary suggested amendments to the confidentiality and arbitration
provisions of the ETA as well, it did not seem necessary to me.  However, we
should obviously discuss further.  Please call or e-mail after you have had
a chance to look at the attached.  Hope all is well.
