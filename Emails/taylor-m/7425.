Dear Mark Taylor,

Just a reminder that your current Reliant Energy Entex statement is ready
for you to review at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/  You can pay
it immediately or schedule payment for a later date.  As with paper bills
your payment is due about 2 weeks from the statement date. If you
participate in the Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account will be
automatically drafted for the amount due.  Remember, with Auto Pay no
action is required to ensure your bill gets paid.


Should you need to modify your account information, go to
http://www.reliantenergy.com/logon/  log into eBill and select User
Information. There you can update your information such as your email
address, change your password and add accounts.

As you use our eBill service, please do not hesitate to provide comments
through the Contact Us section of the site. Note too, our Frequently Asked
Questions section.

Again, thank you for choosing Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.
