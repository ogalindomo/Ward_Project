FYI, here's where we're at with this claim, pursuant to an amount we consider 
was improperly withheld by the counterparty. If you have any questions 
regarding this issue please give me a call.

Subject: Central Piedra Buena Claim

This is to inform you that Central Piedra Buena did not pay the $121.182,21 
debit note on February 25. Pursuant to the terms of the Contract, which were 
reiterated in the note we sent them, as from such date Enron is entitled to 
suspend all further gas deliveries to Central Piedra Buena until payment is 
made. If payment has not been made by March 24, Enron may terminate the 
Contract. Please let me know how you would like to handle this issue going 
forward. Thanks.

Andrea
