Next week is fine.  I just printed out the GTC's from the other sites because 
I had not looked at them.  They had not been previously circulated, and our 
initial discussions made me think about the issues we tabled.  Let me know 
times that work for you.  I will be in Monday through Thursday.  Only Monday 
and Wednesday after 5:15pm are bad for me.

This is the first time I've seen these. Could you call me to discuss on 
Monday to get the background on these documents?

I'll be out tomorrow, but back in on Monday a.m.

Also, Mark and I visited yesterday about the legal checklist you sent to us 
and we have a few additional points to add. We will get you our list early 
next week if that's ok.
