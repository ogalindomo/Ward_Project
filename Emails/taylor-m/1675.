Please find attached the Management Report for March 23, 2000.  

You will note a number of changes in the report format. These have been made 
in order to focus and expand reporting efforts on the information which is 
most useful to the majority of recipients. The statistics in the new format 
clearly show the percentage of transactions on EnronOnline versus traditional 
methods.  

Feedback on the changes is welcome.  

This is a daily report. Should you wish to receive this going forward please
