Further to some of your comments attached is an updated version of the 
approval form. The one attached is for bankruptcy swaps only. There will be 
an identical for other credit derivatives (legal/regulatory requirement).

Could you please let me have any additional comments by London COB 16 May.

Thanks

Tomas
