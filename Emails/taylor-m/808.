Dale,

The statement which Mark Taylor has/is referencing in his email to you is the 
following:

The Floating Price shall be the average of the index for each day in the 
relevant Determination Period.

This should be used for all U.S. and Canadian financial products except 
weather. Please see me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dave
