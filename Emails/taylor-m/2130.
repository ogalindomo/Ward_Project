Attached is a draft price reporting policy to address the Platt's issue we 
discussed.  As I indicated, a number of energy companies have asked for such 
a policy.  We thought that from an industry prospective unifying around a 
single policy made sense.  This policy is an attempt to address the concerns 
we have discussed.  I would appreciate your comments with a view toward 
creating what might be an industry standard in this area.
