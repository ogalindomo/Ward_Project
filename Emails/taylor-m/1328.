Bill

These are more names  for European reference credits which Brian intends to 
trade offline.  With the exception of two names ( TXU Europe and Helsinga 
Energia) the names look OK to me.  (They are all either publicly rated 
investment grade names or e - rated 5+ subs of major groups).  Are there any 
names here that you have an issue with ?

Dear All,

Attached is a list of 49 additional reference credits that we want to quote

Could you please look through these names and let us know if you approve.

Thanks,
