Tom,
I have talked with Rodney Malcolm and several originators and they need two 
financial swap term sheets, one for Enron paying fixed and one for Enron 
paying floating. To this end, I have revised our generic document and created 
two new documents. Could you review each of these, and if they meet with your 
approval, please forward them back to me. Thanks.
