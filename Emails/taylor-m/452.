Thanks

Subject to the optional "marketing information" questions, which I will 
remove, is this the final version, which we are all happy with ?

Here is a revised Registration Form incorporating London Legal's comments.

If you have any queries please contact Justin or myself.

Has this been approved by Houston's credit team?

David

I have attached a redraft of the Registration Form.  You will see that we 
have amended the Credit Requirements section and have also made some 
suggested additions to the Legal Requirements section which Justin should 
review.

Please call with any comments or questions.

Regards

David
