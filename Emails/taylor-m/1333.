All proposed names have now been included and duplicates removed (I 
think).....DW/EC no changes for Europe so go with your list.  Let's 
coordinate on timing when you all get in.  All names new US names have been 
selected off of the Fortune 500 (non energy) where there is public debt and 
an investement grade rating. 

Please call me when you have a chance to look at them and let's discuss any 
concerns.

Thanks for your assistance.
