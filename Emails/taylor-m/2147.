We are in the process of selecting a large number of reference credits to be 
approved for display on the web site.  Our intention is to have 1000 names on 
line by the end of the quarter.  We are internally scrubbing the lists now 
and will forward them soon.  In the meantime, can we get approval to quote 
the following on line:

Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.
KPN N.V.
Deutsche Telekom
Technost International
Vivendi
Ryder Systems
Petrocanada
