Attached is the response to the survey with my initial comments and questions 
blacklined.  Andrea, please read the survey and the response and add your own 
comments so that we can follow up with Mark and Marval O'Farrell on the open 
issues.  I will try to speak with you tomorrow morning to go over this and 
the master issues.  Thanks.
