Marcelo:

Pursuant to our previous discussions, I am attaching a copy of the Legal 
Contact list for use by Enron Metals employees in the US, Canada, and South 
America. Also, as we discussed, since Houston is not yet linked to the 
MG/Enron Metals e-mail address book, please circulate via e-mail for me the 
Legal Contact list to each of the Enron Metals employees in NY, Chicago, St. 
Louis, Montreal, and South America (Lima and Santiago).  Thanks.

If anyone has any questions, they are free to call me at 713-853-3214.

Regards, Alan
