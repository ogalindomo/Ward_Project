Dear Mark

This is Jay, the red head that you met at the last EnronOnline meeting with 
Greg Whalley.  Paul Goddard has asked me to speak with you about letters of 
consent that may or may not be needed for newsticker items.  I think this 
could be (unfortunately for your team's workload) an increasingly important 
area as we move forward with developing content (news and other).

If you could help me with any or all of the following, I'd appreciate it:

--Is there a general legal policy with regards to obtaining consent (both in 
terms of when we should obtain consent and whether or not there's a standard 
letter)?

--Do we have a list of current letters of consent on file?  Is there someone 
who is responsible for this?

--Specifically, the CDD/HDD & US Gas Storage data was, I thought, 'homegrown' 
(thus no letter of consent) but now I've learned that it comes from a 
Telerate feed.  Are we covered there or do we need a letter of consent?

Any information, or even guidance, on these issues would be greatly 
appreciated.  I'll be in Houston starting next week, for a couple of weeks, 
so hopefully I'll be able to stop in and say, 'Hello'

All the best,

Jay
