P. S.  Further to my previous memo, please see that Kay Young also receives 
such Closing Documents, as well as closing documents related to any asset 
transactions, so that they may be included in our ENA Legal file room.   My 
apologies for this omission.   If you have any questions or comments, please 
call me.  Thanks, Deb
