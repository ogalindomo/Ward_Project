Cheryl Nelson will be out of the office from 2:30pm today to travel to New 
York.  I will be away through January 26th (the end of next week).  I will be 
attending an ISDA conference on the 24th and will be travelling on the 25th.

Carol St. Clair will cover all work, with the exception of the Brokerage 
Agreements, which Sara Shackleton will handle.  You may contact me directly 
at my home phone number, 212-281-7454.  If necessary, you may leave a 
voicemail message.

Should you need help with any administrative issues in my absence, my 
assistant Keegan Farrell (5-3317) will be happy to assist you.  

Regards, 
Cheryl Nelson
