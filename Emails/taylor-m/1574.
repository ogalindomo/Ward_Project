Subject: Credit Derivatives Reference Entities

I have received reactions from several of the other Enron operating companies 
(EBS, EES and GPG) requesting that the following entities be placed on the 
Restricted List for credit derivatives Reference Entities:

AT&T Corp.
Baltimore Gas & Electric Company
Bell Atlantic Corporation
BellSouth Corp.
Cable & Wireless plc
Comdisco, Inc.
Cox Communications, Inc.
Intel
IBM
Lucent Technologies
Monsanto
SBC Communications
Sun Microsystems
Union Carbide
Viacom
Wisconsin Electric Power Company
Wisconsin Gas Company 

These companies were those on the attached list (forwarded to the various 
General Counsels on 2/28) which were found to be objectionable for one reason 
or another.  I have not yet heard from the former EI companies.
