The Index for a Determination Period shall be the average of the daily 
settlement prices on the OM London 
Exchange (formerly the OMLX exchange) of the Pulpex Futures Contract for 
Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft 
(the "Futures Contract") for each day on which the OM London Exchange is open 
(a "Trading Day") 
during the Determination Period. The Futures Contract will be the contract 
with the earliest expiration date, except 
on those days that fall within 10 Trading Days before that expiration date, 
in which case the next successive 
Futures Contract price shall be used.
