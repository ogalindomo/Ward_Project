Justin - 

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding 
prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I 
think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston 
time Tuesday.  Any chance you might be available to listen in?
