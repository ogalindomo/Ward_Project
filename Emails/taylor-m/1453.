Subject: Pancanadian Energy Services

Rick Tucker  attorney  for  Pancanadian Energy has questioned the necessity 
of receiving an additional copy of  confirmations on EOL  deals.  Rick is 
requesting that Enron stop sending written confirmations on EOL  deals.  
Pancanadian is currently not returning these 
confirmations. Rick's argument is that Enron is requesting that they execute 
EOL  deals twice.  Mark Taylor (legal) opinion is that the traders should 
inform the counterparty what Enron's policy is.  Mark  has  assigned  this  
issue  to  Carol St.Clair   to  resolve.  To  date  no  revised legal 
position has been  decided.  Counterparty contacts  are:
Rick Tucker  (legal) : ph. (713)331-5049
Cyrena Stanley  (secretary) : ph. (713)331-5145
