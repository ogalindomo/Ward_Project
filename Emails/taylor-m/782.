Attached is a revised draft of our memo, blacklined to show changes.  Please 
note that the draft reflects our most recent understanding that, in the 
absence of a master agreement, GTCs will govern.  If this has changed, per 
the recent e-mails, we will revise the memo accordingly.  Please call or 
e-mail with any comments.  Best regards.
