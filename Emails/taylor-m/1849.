Hi Mark

Thanks for your prompt reply. 
Just one question I'm anticipating from customers - "why can't the contracts 
(PA and ETA) be governed by Japanese law - why did you choose NY law?"
Can we change these to be governed by Japanese law (this would be ideal)?

Regards
Rousseau

We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax 
or other legal consequences to their trading.  The only thing we could safely 
say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax 
consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax 
advisor."

Mark

In your FAQ, could you please put something about the tax consequences for 
Japanese counterparties

Also, sorry to rush you but we really need something by Friday Tokyo time so 
that we can put in in for translation.
