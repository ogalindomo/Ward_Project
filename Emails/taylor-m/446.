Mark, I apologize for not having responded sooner, however I have been in and 
out of the office and did not see your email until yesterday.  Let me know if 
you still need me to fill out David's performance review.

Thanks
John

My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for 
David Portz.  He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my 
supervision and I didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today.
