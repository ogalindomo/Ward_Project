Reflecting a few comments from Eric Saibi, Ed Baughman and Leslie Hansen to 
the June 16th draft website text, attached are auction rules and the auction 
website text for the EOL Generation Capacity Products.  I am asking for any 
final comments/changes, within the next day if possible, so that the 
definitve texts can be made available to the EOL programmers.  Thanks.
