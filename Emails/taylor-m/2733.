Mark-

I'd like to brief you further on events in Washington today and also, in
Mark H's absence, discuss briefly the proposed activities of the Energy
Derivatives Committee over the next few months.  Enron, of course, has a
major role.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards, Ruth (212-332-2562)
