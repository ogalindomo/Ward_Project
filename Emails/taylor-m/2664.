Please go into the Data Manager in EOL and sign-off on the following new 
Product Types. This is in response to me recent e-mails, and I have attached 
the final Product Long Description for your review.

US Gas Phy Index Firm 10-day Flexible non-Tx>1Mo<1Yr
US Gas Phy Index Firm 5-day Flexible non-Tx>1Mo<1Yr
US Gas Phy Index Firm 3-day Flexible non-Tx>1Mo<1Yr

The systems folks that I work with ask that you sign-off on this as quickly 
as possible. Doing so prevents them from having multiple uploads near 
weeks-end.
