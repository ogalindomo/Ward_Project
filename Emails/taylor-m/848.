Just to confirm recent conversations:

1) At the current time, customers must accept the GTC for each new Product 
Type grouping (e.g. Belgian Gas Physical forward and Belgian Gas Physical 
Forward Option would each require acceptance of the same GTC).

2) We would like to keep the "deal roadblocks" to a minimum - e.g. we do not 
want to push customers into reviewing and accepting contracts more often than 
necessary.

3) We should change EOL so that when a GTC is accepted, all Product Types 
which reference that GTC will show that the GTC has been already accepted.


If anyone disagrees with the above, please let me know ASAP, otherwise I will 
discuss making the change with Jay.

Thanks,

Dave
