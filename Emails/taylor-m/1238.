Before Christmas, I was selling calendars for Jason's Church Youth Camp Fund 
Raiser.  I would like to thank those of you who supported him during this 
time.

The church had some of the calendars left over so I volunteered to help sell 
the remaining ones for $2.00 instead $6.00 each since we are halfway through 
February.  Please let me know if you would like one.  The money will also go 
towards the Youth Camp scheduled for this summer.

I have 7 of them left.  Thanks again!!!
