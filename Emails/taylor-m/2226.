I was mistaken - the updates have not actually occurred yet - but are likely 
to be in very shortly (within the next day or two)

Subject: Read Only Restrictions

Bryan,

As discussed previously, we have modified the customer profiles to allow read 
only access to credit derivatives as a standard default for all customers.

We have not modified any criteria for execution access.
