I am concerned about the status of the Power and Gas GTCs. 

I am pushing the marketing group to sign up customers in advance of launch 
but we still have not finalized an agreement. This is of the utmost 
importance otherwise turning EOL on will be like listening to yourself 
talk.   

Please advise of the status of these documents and when I can review them.
