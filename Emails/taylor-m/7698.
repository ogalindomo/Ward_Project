Mark,
We are still waiting on comments from Dave Forster (he is currently in the 
U.K.), but attached is the draft in its current form. I know that you wanted 
to forward this to the legal team in New York this afternoon.
We will let you know if Dave wants to make any major changes.
Thanks and let us know if you have any questions.
Carl
