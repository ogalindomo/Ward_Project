Jordan Mintz has requested that his global finance group be provided with a 
lunch time seminar on the basics of swapping.  I thought your basic swap 
discussion, together with a set of your basic materials would be just the 
right thing!  Could you coordinate with Jordan to set a date?  I am happy to 
assist in the presentation etc. if you like.  Thanks.  Mary
