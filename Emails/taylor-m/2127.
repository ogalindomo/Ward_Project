Subject: MG acquisition and EOL trades

I am aware that we will be offering some MG products (once the acquisition is 
complete) via EOL and want to highlight a few issues upfront:

1. MG Limited is a SFA regulated entity
2. The intention is that the MG acquisition will be held by an off balance 
sheet fund by the end of the year. This means that MG entities will not be 
subsidiaries of Enron Corp. I wonder whether there are any legal or 
regulatory issues arising from offering the bid/offer prices of 
non-subsidiaries via EOL (or maybe a wholly owned Enron sub posts the prices 
and then hedges with MG ?).

Regards
Janine
