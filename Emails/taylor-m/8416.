Subject: Mid-Year Performance Management-Feedback Francisco Pinto Leite

Mr. Lundstrom:

Francisco Pinto-Leite requested my feedback for the Mid-Year Performance 
Management Process.  I am stationed in Guatemala City, Guatemala and we do 
not have access to the PEP system on line.  Therefore, attached I am sending 
the requested feedback.  I am sorry for any inconvenience that this process 
may cause.

Thanks,

Roberto Figueroa
