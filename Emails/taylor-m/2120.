Subject: GPU Services -- Letter Agreement re ETA

Dave:

Attached please find my proposed additions to the letter drafted by Carol St. 
Clair in response to comments from GPU Energy.  Please note that this 
counterparty does not enter into transactions on its own behalf but rather as 
an agent on behalf of several utiltities.  Please review the attached 
documents and call me so that we can discuss your comments and/or concerns.

Leslie
