I understand you where looking for me the other day. I am assuming it is 
regarding Brent's review. It did come up in ESA PRC and I recalled at that 
point that I had not provided any feedback. I do not think Brent put me on 
his list. I would imagine for you reviewing Brent it might be difficult with 
out my feedback.

How do you wish to proceed. We can discuss it verbally of I can fill out a 
feedback form your choice.

Thanks

MFG
