I attach the draft wording (from Clifford Chance, also incorporating Justin's 
comments) for the statement in the Garden website that submission of the PA 
does not guarantee that the customer will be issued with a password 
(Outstanding Legal Issue no. 8).

Please forward your comments to myself.

Thanks, Edmund.
