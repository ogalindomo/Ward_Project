Mark -

Attached is a memo outlining my status on various matters.  I know there is a 
meeting today with Greg Piper on CommodityLogic.  If you need more 
information on what is happening, please let me know.

Unfortunately, I will be out this a.m. for a funeral  - starting at 10:00.  I 
anticipate being back prior to lunch and will check in via cell on my way 
back in case you need anything further.
