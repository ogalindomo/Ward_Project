What do you guys think about this?

Interesting report on successful case brought against internet business
which suggests that internet businesses face increasing risk of being sued
in any jurisdiction in which their sites can be accessed. Ruling by New York
State Supreme Court.

Whilst dealing with gaming, as a criminal offence was likely to attract more
interest, offshore company had its computers in Antigua but held to be
governed by New York State gaming laws because New Yorkers were able to
access the site and place bets.

Subject: PA/ETA



Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.
