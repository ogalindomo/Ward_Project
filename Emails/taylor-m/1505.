Sorry for the delay. I have been out of the office for few days.  Anyway 
attached is the request for advice. Hope it is of some help.I also enclosed 
the file note that I produced after our discussion last month. That proved 
very useful in focusing counsel in on the relevant issues.

David - 

I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan 
in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you 
have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this 
for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in 
Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.

Thanks,

Mark
