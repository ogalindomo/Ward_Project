Regarding the following list, please make the following observation

1. Pacific Gas and Electric Company should be replaced by PG&E Corporation 
-the parent entity
2. AOL is subinvestment grade
3. Quest Communications is wrongly spelled. It should be Qwest Communications 
with the ticker Q

Thanks and Regards
