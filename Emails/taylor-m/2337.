Subject: EOL Test Update

Mario/Dale,

Would you please update the EOL Test Environment with the following 
Australian Weather Long Form Descriptions. Please note the Japanese Long 
Forms are not final yet, and some fields may change prior to the transfer to 
production. The Australian GTC's are with Houston Legal at present, and the 
Japanese GTC will be finished in the next 2 days.


Regards,

Justin
