Travis, Mark,

Please see below advice regarding paper swaps with Czech C/Ps.  However, this 
advice applies to all OTC derivatives trades whatever the underlying 
commodity.  We will need to keep a close eye on the new law (expected to come 
into force January 2001) to determine whether we will need to be separately 
licenced.

Regards

Justin
