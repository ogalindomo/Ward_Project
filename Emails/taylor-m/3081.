This just came and seems a little light on content and details.  Also I was 
under the impression that there was meant to be points for World Records and 
Olympic Records (can we use the word "Olympic" in the "how to play" section?).

Before I respond please revue and provide feedback/thoughts.

Cheers

Victor

Victor,

Just missed your call.  I will follow up with you later today on prizing
covering North America.  Attached below is a basic game overview on how to
enter and play.  Let me know if you need more details.

Thanks,
Craig
