Subject: Union Oil and ETA for Enron Online

I received a call from Rosario Sindel with Union Oil. She has some questions 
in regards to the ETA. She asked to speak with Louise Kitchen or Legal 
council. I was unable to contact you by phone at the time of the call. Could 
you please contact Ms. Sindel at 310-726-7767.

Thanks,
