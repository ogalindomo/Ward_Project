Please find attached a slightly revised (by Joe Carrico) draft of the
ISDA/GMRA Insolvency Bridge, which takes the approach, if a Bankruptcy Event
of Default occurs, of deeming relevant repo transactions to be Transactions
under the ISDA Master Agreement.  While we wish to focus our discussion
tomorrow on the draft "Cross-Agreement Bridge", we would be happy to hear
some further discussion on this type of approach.
