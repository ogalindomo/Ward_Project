Subject: Revising EOL deals

Mark/Brent,

Can one of you give us a definitive opinion on how we should handle revisions 
to EOL traded deals?  Currently we do it one of two ways:  1) Straight 
revision to original EOL Deal number, or 2) Input reversal trade, also input 
new trade with correct deal terms (confirms on all three).

Obviously the 1st option above is the easier way to go for us.  However for 
EOL auditing, option 2 is cleaner.  Also, if you think we should always go 
with the 2nd option above, should we be linking the deals together with some 
sort of verbage?

Thanks,
Joe Hunter
