Brent and Mark;

Remi Collonges has asked me to set up branches of ECE (Enron's marketing 
entity) in different submarkets of Brazil (States of Bahia and Santa 
Catarina).  I've been told by Randy Young that, prior to opening a "trading 
office", we may need Board approval.  I'd appreciate it if you could provide 
me with more information on the matter.

Rgds,

Sami
