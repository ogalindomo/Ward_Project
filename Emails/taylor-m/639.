Subject: Missing GTC's

Mark,

I notice that we have GTC's for EGLI Liquids(without collateral) and ELFI 
Crude-Products-Petchems (without collateral), but we do not have GTC's for 
EGLI Liquids (with collateral) or ELFI Crude-Products-Petchems (with 
collateral).   Is this correct? 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
