Mark, 

To reiterate our phone conversation from this past Friday (7/14), we need to 
send out a partially executed Confidentiality Agreement which includes the 
changes that you discussed with El Paso Production's Chief Council.

Please let me know if I need to do anything and if/not, please send me a copy 
of what you send out.

Thank You,

John
