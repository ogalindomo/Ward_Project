"Good meal" in Monmouth?  Not sure if that is really possible by your 
standards.  I had the Barnstormer in mind.  It pretty much has to be better 
than the food at the Stockdale Center.

Oh....Yes I will be there. I arrive early on Thursday in Moline. Plan to visit
the Boone grave site and then drive down. I just signed up for the dinner 
thing
yesterday. I'd rather be with you and Doc. Maybe I can cancel once I get 
there.
I will send an email. Are we going to get a good meal.
Mark

Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next 
week?
I'm setting up dinner with Doc (instead of the Private Dining Room affair) in
case you're interested.
