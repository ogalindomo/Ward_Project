Hi Mark, 

Here is the file I was going to forward on to our creative team that is 
filming in Tokyo.  It will be what is shown on the traders computer screen.  
There probably won't be any close-ups, but just in case, I want to make sure 
you are okay with it.  Thanks so much for doing this so last minute and so 
quickly!  Have a good one, Margaret
