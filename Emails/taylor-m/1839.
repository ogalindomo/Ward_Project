Given the increased activity relating to reform of the Commodity Exchange
Act the past two weeks, I have attached a memorandum outlining the status of
various initiatives for your review.  Please feel free to contact me if you
have any questions or if you are in need of additional information(i.e.
copy/outline of Ewing legislation).
