I am delighted and thankful.  On our side, I'm fairly sure I can enlist the 
help of Patrick Hensen, so that our dependance on your team be kept at the 
necessary minimum while we benefit from his experience.

I will coordinate with my team and call Carlos next week to see whether he 
wants to take advantage of my presence in Houston the week of the 11th to 
15th of December to be briefed on the status of our efforts (and to be 
briefed on our next to do's).

Again, thanks for your support,

Remi

Remi,

Further to our recent conversation and in light of the information which you 
provided regarding attainable margins, we have re-prioritised our workload to 
accomodate a Brazilian launch by February.

Carlos Alatorre will be the person within EnronOnline who will help you in 
preparing for launch.

Dave
