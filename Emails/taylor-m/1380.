In Bryan's absence, please work together where necessary to let Mark Taylor, 
Ed and me know/have the following as soon as possible so we can finalise our 
legal due diligence before launch of online credit trading:

best estimate of the launch date for credit trading
the final list of counterparties
the final list of reference credits

Thanks

Paul
