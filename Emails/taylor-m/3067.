Are we still on target to receive your comments within the next day or so?  
We really need to complete this process.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mark and Brent-

Please inform me when you anticipate your respective reviews of the ISDA

In the interim, if you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks,
