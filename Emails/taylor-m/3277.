Mark Powell:

The changes seem appropriate to me; however, I will defer to Jeff Hodge, my 
fellow Committe member, on giving the Commitee's approval to this set of 
recommended changes due to his involvement in the Blue Range matter.

Mark, I agree with your analysis, conclusions and amendments.  Well done.  I 
trust the Legal Trading Committee will also agree, but I will be interested 
by their response.

Peter.
