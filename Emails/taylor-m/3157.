Subject: Consolidated Edison, Inc. Confirmation Letter

Hi Mark, I work in the power documentation group and create power financial 
confirms.  Can you please look at the following confirm and let me know if 
anything needs to be changed?  I understand that you are the attorney that 
knows about this deal.    

Please contact Jason Wiesepape if you have any questions about the deal

Thank you,
