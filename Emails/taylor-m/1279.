Mark,

I don't get all warm and fuzzy about point #1 - what do you think?

Subject: Yorkshire Electricity - EOL comfort letter

Dear All,

Attached is a draft proposed comfort letter dealing with the issues that 
Yorkshire Electricity has with respect to the ETA.  I have forwarded this to 
their lawyers' for comments.

Please note that the letter does not amend the ETA, and is in no way 
inconsistent with the current legal structure of EOL.

I have told Yorkshire's lawyer that this document is subject to internal 
commercial sign-off, so if you do have any comments please feel free to 
forward them to me.

Thanks, Edmund.
