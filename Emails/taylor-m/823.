Mark-

I just wanted to confirm that it is ok by U.S. law to use/file Registration 
and Password Applications that have been received by fax and that the 
original, signed copies are not required for EnronOnline.

Thanks,

Justin Boyd replied to my query as to whether it is acceptable to receive 
faxed registration forms and password applications.  According to European 
law, faxed copies of these forms are allowed.  It is to Justin's knowledge 
that Mark Taylor in the Houston legal department approved this process.
