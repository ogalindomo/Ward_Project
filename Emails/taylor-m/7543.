Please review and advise on the following Product description for a "WTI 
Physical Basis" product.  The pricing index is Platt's for the day of the 
transaction with the difference between the 1st line WTI and other Platt's 
indices (the example below is matched to WTI Midland; other Platt's indices 
include:  WTS; LLS; HLS; Wyo. Sweet; Eugene Island; Mars; Poseidon; Bonito; 
Kern River; ANS(Cal); Basrah Lt).

The exact delivery locations are in the process of being identified.  
However, the description below uses Cushing OK as a location.

If you need to discuss further, please call me.  Thanks

Rob
