????HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 9, 2001--EC Outlook, a software provider 
that automates the collaborative commerce activities of Global 1000 companies 
and their trading partners, has signed a licensing agreement with Enron 
Corp., one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications 
companies, providing both companies with technology to enhance their 
commodity-related businesses.
????Enron is planning to use EC Outlook's Smart Document Interchange (SDI) 
Server(TM) software to streamline the exchange of certain documents with 
trading partners in commodity markets outside of its traditional energy and 
communications industries. Such industries include metals, pulp and paper and 
others. The SDI Server product helps companies and their partners share 
information without invasive hardware and software installations.
????EC Outlook, in turn, will enhance its software offering with proprietary 
data interchange applications developed by Enron to manage complex logistical 
activities in natural gas and electricity markets. EC Outlook will integrate 
industry-specific functionalities and processes from this software into its 
own applications to deliver enhanced capabilities to customers.
????"Enron's data interchange technology is a strategic acquisition for us," 
said Matt Verghese, president and COO of EC Outlook. "Coupled with our 
existing applications, we can very effectively support the 
transaction-intensive needs of energy and other commodity businesses."
????"Commodity markets, like natural gas, electricity and others, will 
significantly benefit from electronically automating commerce activities 
among trading partners," said Greg Runyan, senior analyst with Yankee Group. 
"The agreement between EC Outlook and Enron is a perfect example of how 
market leaders can gain a competitive edge."
