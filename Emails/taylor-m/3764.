I am proposing the following language be inserted in the Password 
Applications for all Latin American counterparties who want to trade online.  
I would appreciate your comments.   I will run the issue by Richard Sanders 
or Michelle Cash as well.

"For the purpose the Password Application, the ETA, the GTC and any 
Transaction, Counterparty appoints as its Process Agent, 
_______________________________, having an office in 
___________________________ (specify city in the United States) on the date 
of this Agreement at ___________________________________________ (specify 
address in the United States)."
If you approve of the language I will have the EOL team place this in the 
Password Applications.
Thanks,
Brent
