I have a subcontractor coming tomorrow morning at 8:30 for an estimate; I 
will try to finish with this as soon as possible, but may not make into the 
office until late.  I have a 10 a.m. conference call scheduled tomorrow that 
I may just do from home, so it may not be until around 11 or so that I get in.

As always, I can be reached on my cellular phone (713/594-2683).  -- Bob
