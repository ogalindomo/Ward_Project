In the event that any of your direct reports in Buenos Aires are receiving a 
1999 bonus I wanted to co-ordinate the administration of such bonus to ensure 
we follow your instructions and avoid communicating twice. 

We are available to assist in the administration to the extent requested by 
each of you. The standard administration is in the format of a letter of 
appreciation and recognition dispersed directly by myself. 

If you wish to administer this directly or together please let me know. If 
there is an alternative format you wish to use we are also happy to 
accommodate and assist if needed.
