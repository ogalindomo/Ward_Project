Couldn't reach either of you by phone today.

Had a useful kick off chat with Ken Raisler who appears to be very up to 
speed and happy to assist with this project on the North American legal side. 
Please confirm that's fine with you.

Let's try to speak tomorrow - I'll try to set someting up.

Thanks

Paul
