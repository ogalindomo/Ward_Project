On the subject of the Customer Registration Form, the EOL group would like to 
amend the form as follows:

? to ask the registrant to indicate which industry/business it is involved in;
? to ask the registant to indicate whether it is interested in view- and/or 
trade- access.

This seems fine to me - but I wanted to hear from you...

Hope all's well with you...

Thanks
