Pursuant to yesterday's emails, a point of clarification on timing.  The 
EnronOnline team due diligence process requires two full weeks from the time 
of official sign off by all relevant parties to bring a new business onto 
production for external customers. 

As soon as you are capable of providing an email which confirms your approval 
we can begin setting the products up for online transactions.  

Thank your for your cooperation.

Mark
