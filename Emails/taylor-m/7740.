Attached is a copy of the term sheet sent to Aquila Energy this morning 
regarding the proposed transaction between ENA, Aquila Energy, and Onondaga 
Cogeneration L.P..

The proposed transaction involves the refinancing of an existing financial 
swap agreement between Onondaga and NIMO and the sale of ENA's existing cash 
flow interest in Onondaga.

Call/see me to discuss.

Fred
