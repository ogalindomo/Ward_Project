After discussing the status of our outstanding PA's with credit we have 
adjusted the proceess to get us in line with our 3 day turnaround objective.  
By close of business 11/19 we should have all PA's received prior to 11/16 
processed with a status of: ID mailed, waiting on customer info or Requires 
Div/Branch Resolution.  The following process will be used moving forward:

PA's received from from Initial Mailout Counterparties with Credit reject 
status (bankruptcy, E rating 10, 11, 12) will be mailed read only id and 
letter to indicating a need for them to call us to discuss options for 
getting execute status ( these calls will be forwarded to credit)

PA's received from Initial Mailout Counterparties with Credit reject status 
($0 exposure, no info) will be contacted by PCG to obtain a credit contact, 
Credit will call credit contact and try to obtain required info.  Once Credit 
has contacted counterparty and requested info, PA status report will reflect 
- Waiting on customer info.  Credit will have ownership of moving this issue 
forward in a timely manner. 

Credit will give initial mailout counterparties priority over new application 
requests however the turnaround objective for all PA's remains at three days.

New applications and PA's will be forwarded to credit immediately upon 
receipt (unless it is a muni or utility which will be forwarded to legal 
first).  Credit should not reject a muni or utility for anything other than 
credit issues.  Legal will address legal and regulatory issues.

Divisions/Branches with approved parent should have the ability to trade.  
Dave Forster is trying to develop a work around for the credit upload issue 
surrounding division/branches.  Until this issue is resolved the PA report 
will state Requires Div/Branch Resolution.

PA's which are completed with execute status will state Execute ID mailed

PA's which are completed with read only status will state Read-Only ID mailed

PA's which are under credit review will state such on the PA report

Please contact me immediately if you have an issue with any of the above at 
30397.
