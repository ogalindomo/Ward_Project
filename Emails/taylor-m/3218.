Julia/Alan/Mark -

Mark asked me to work on a broad outline of a technology plan for the ENA 
Legal Department.  Attached is a draft of the basic outline for the plan and 
the technology alternatives to be considered.  I have based this outline on 
specific areas Mark and I discussed, but it is by no means intended to be 
limited to these areas.  Mark does see the importance of a  deal 
collaboration/e-signature technology and asked that this be the first item 
reviewed for implementation.

At your convenience, please let me know your thoughts and suggestions 
concerning the attached.  If there area any other areas the plan should 
cover, please let me know.

Thanks.
