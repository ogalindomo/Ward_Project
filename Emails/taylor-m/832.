I'm not too worried about this - the letter which Mark Taylor is preparing 
will state that whatever method we choose to use will supercede EOL - so if 
everything is set to GTC and the GTC flags are set to "read", that should be 
enough - unless someone is worried about the confirms.

Subject: Desk to Desk Masters

Karen Lambert has indicated that we have Master Agreements between HPLC and 
ENA (physical) and between ENA and ECC (physical &financial).   We will need 
to populate the master agreements in EOL.  I need some direction relative to 
this to assure we sent it up correctly.  In addition, we will assign the 
short agreement you discussed a global id and populate this number in EOL for 
all desk to desk trades that are intra company.
