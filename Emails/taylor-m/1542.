Mark,

Looks like we will be adding Japan to the list of countries in which 
Customers will be able to transact. Could you please set the ball rolling on 
the drafting of a new PA and ETA?

Also: We have a new addition to our group: Mario Parra-Cardoso. Mario will be 
working with me in getting Japan up and running - so you may receive some 
phone calls from him on the subject.

Thanks,

Dave
