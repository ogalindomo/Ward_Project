Mark Taylor and I reviewed the subject agreement and have some general 
comments.

Given the agreement is between EBS and the outside counterparties we would 
like to eliminate any mention of EnronOnline (the only place were we feel it 
may be necessary is in the failover article IV).   EBS has the EIN which can 
be used as an alternative to the Internet and the customer has agreed to use 
such alternative.
The term can be month to month with thirty days written notice by either 
party.  No need to mention EnronOnline or the pilot program. 
Can we make this agreement much more customer friendly?  This appears to be 
an agreement that you use with customers who are being guranteed a certain 
level of service (as evidenced by the reference to ePowered Content in 
Article XIII).  We would like to keep the agreement focused on access to 
facility, letter of authorization and the interconnect order if possible.   I 
understand that you are commiting to EnronOnline a certain level of service 
which is predicated upon your ability to get assurances from our customers 
however we should deal with that in our agreement if necessary.
What is the extent of the equiptment that we will be housing at the 
facilities?  If it is limited this would give us another opportunity to 
reduce the scope of the contract.

Lets discuss tomorrow and see if we can get this wrapped up.  Lorraine will 
schedule.  Thanks
