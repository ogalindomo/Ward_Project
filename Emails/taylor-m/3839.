Well, my first week here hasn't been much fun as I have spent most of it
sick.  I am hoping to get out and see a little more of the city this
weekend.  I just wanted to say thanks again for the books and sweaters.
They have already come in handy.

So now that Florida has certified Bush as the winner of that state, are you
getting started on your Bush transition team assignment?

Hope you had a good Thanksgiving.  Tell Ted I said hello.

I'll talk to you later.
