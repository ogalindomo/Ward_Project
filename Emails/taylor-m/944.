As a result of a smooth launch and market demand, we are accelerating the 
timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products.

Specifically,  after the launch of U.S. power on Monday, Dec. 13th, we will 
be launching the following:

Wednesday, December 15: US Coal, U.S. Plastics, US Pulp and Paper
Thursday, December 16: Norwegian Power

Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above, I would 
appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant 
to your area and confirm that you are happy with them (some of you are 
already in the process of doing so - thank you)

We absolutely want to avoid making changes after launch due to the problems 
associated with changing descriptions on products which have already traded.

The Product Long Descriptions can be seen in the Product Manager by expanding 
the Product Type in the tree to show each of the dependent Products, then 
right-clicking the Product, selecting View and then pressing the View 
Description button which appears on the pop-up window.

Please contact myself or Dale Neuner if you have any comments.

Thanks,

Dave
