We are looking at giving an offer for a bankruptcy swap to Reliant Energy for

 Lumen Energy Corporation (Reference Credit)

The tenor of the deal would be April-December 2000 for a value of USD500k-1m.

On a more general note, could we please agree on procedures for approval of 
new reference credits.

Regards

Tomas
