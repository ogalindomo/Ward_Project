Mark,
Thank you for you phonecall and getting back to me so quickly.  This e-mail
is to confirm that you will be providing CXY with a letter that clarifies a
few issues that were we were uncomfortable with in the Electronic Trading
Agreement for Enron Online.  We would like clarification that the Master
Agreement already entered into between the parties will govern all aspects
of any physical trades made online, including those respecting transaction
procedures.  Particularly, we would ask that you acknowledge that Enron
shall continue to send confirmations for each and every Transaction.

Although we understand that the key password holder has the ability to
cancel passwords, we would like the ability, over and above that, as a
company, to be able to notify you and have you cancel passwords or to
terminate the online trading agreement completely.  As it is drafted, only
Enron has the ability to terminate.

As we do not yet have the ability to use electronic signatures, notices must
be sent as set out in the Master Agreement or the ISDA, (which we appear to
be close to signing).

Thank you again for your assistance with these issues and we look forward to
receiving your letter. The traders are now happy.

Susan Schulli
