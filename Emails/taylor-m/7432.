Here are the latest versions.  You'd probably be most interested in Article 8 
of the Master Agreement.

Gentlemen:

Attached you will find "red-lined" versions of four documents: Master 
Agreement, Members Agreement, and the Subscription Documents.  In the essence 
of time, I am sending them your way prior to Enron internal review.  But, 
this seems to be the only way you will have the opportunity to review them 
prior to our Monday afternoon meeting.  Especially, treat the DealBench(tm) 
related items in the Master as very preliminary as they were in fact put 
forth by EGM with no DealBench review in the form contained therein.  As 
such, they may require very significant redrafting.

Thank you,

Doug
