This is the note I prepared for external counsel regarding the proposed new 
third party prices functionality for EOL .  Hope this accords with your 
understanding.  Incidentally, on what basis did we get round the CFTC 
rules..?..this might help me in any discussions with the SFA, given that it 
does raise regulatory issues

Hope all's well with you...

Justin
