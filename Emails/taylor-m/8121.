I am in the process of ordering more business cards for Cheryl Nelson, but I 
do not know what the correct company name should be.  Should it be EWS, or 
Enron Americas, ENA or something else?  I had spoken with Holly, and she 
instructed me to direct my question to you.  Please advise, at your earliest 
convenience.  I appreciate your attention to this matter.  Hope you have a 
lovely weekend.  

Thanks,
Keegan
