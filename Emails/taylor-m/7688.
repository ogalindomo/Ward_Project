Brent,

As I anticipated, Lavarato seems to want to get started with financial 
transactions in Argentina as soon as possible.  The boys told me that once 
they have the document they would take it on some sort of road show in order 
to get input from the market prior to putting it on line.  In order to do so, 
they have requested certain "flexibility" regarding the terms of the 
agreement that the prospective CP's may want to have changed.  They 
understood and agreed that the concept behind the contracts on EOL is that 
they are standardized and are not intended to be modified upon CP's request 
once they are on line.

Also, we need to confirm that this document can be used both online and 
"offline".   Did you get a chance to take a look at the changes?

Regards,


Andrea
