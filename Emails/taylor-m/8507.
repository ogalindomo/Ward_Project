For your information,

I have been advised by facilities that a locksmith should arrive within 24 
hours to re-key the 5-drawer cabinets containing the blue and green files.  
You will be able to open any of the seven cabinets with one key.  They will 
delivery 5 copies of the key (one for each specialist).
