Subject: FYI call approx. 1.5 weeks ago from Madelon Coover @ AGENCY

Jay/Dave - as I mentioned Madelon Coover called approx. a week and a half ago 
trying to get in our good books (or in her words 'resurrect our 
relationship').  

The only two things she said of any interest were the following:

- they have developed a WAP/ Palm(?) prototype in Dallas that enables some 
degree of EnronOnline quotes to this platform (not sure of functionality) - 
she was clearly keen to show this to us (I did not commit us in any way ) 

- she also mentioned their Portland office is doing work for EBS , something 
to do with broadband and that they were 'very happy with their work'.
