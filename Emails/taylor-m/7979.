As promised, please find attached the materials for Wednesday afternoon's
meeting.

The materials consist of:

1. Revised draft Cross-Agreement Bridge;
2. Accompanying memorandum;
3. Draft ISDA/GMRA Bridge taking the "transaction" approach (previously
distributed);
4. Draft ISDA/GMRA Bridge taking the "insolvency" approach (previously
distributed);
5. Draft ISDA/OSLA Bridge taking the "transaction" approach (previously
distributed);
6. Draft ISDA/OSLA Bridge taking the "insolvency" approach (previously
distributed);
7. Allen & Overy memorandum to the Working Group (dated 24th November,
1999);
8. Allen & Overy memorandum to the Strategic Documentation Review Task
Force (dated 6th December, 1999)

During the meeting, we would like to focus attention on the revised
Cross-Agreement Bridge.  In previous meetings, the Working Group reached a
broad consensus that we should pursue the "insolvency" approach, and, in
particular, the approach taken in the draft Cross-Agreement Bridge.  This
approach is the approach that has been considered by our legal counsel in
the course of providing advice in relation to the various amendments and
provisions proposed as a result of our Strategic Documentation Review (you
should have received most of the SDR opinions by e-mail from Barbara Hanlon
on 16th February).  The advice we received on this type of bridge is, for
the most part, very positive.

However, we are also circulating copies of the other draft bridges that the
group has already considered, including those that try to take a
"transaction" approach.  Although our focus at present is very much on
trying to finalise a Cross-Agreement Bridge, we would welcome any further
discussion on possible future efforts.

Kind regards,
John.
