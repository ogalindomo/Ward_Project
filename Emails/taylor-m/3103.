Subject: Metals Brokers on EnronOnline

Hi Guys

As you are aware some of the metals counterparties we have heard from conduct 
two types of business:

- proprietary trading for own book
- brokerage for customers

It has been decided to give such metals brokers only, access to metals 
products on EnronOnline for trading purposes.

Can you please let me know whether you have any specific reasons why we 
should not go ahead with this course of action.

Be aware that some of these brokers will be clearing their business through 
LCH.  This would entail tagging deals with such counterparties in the back 
office systems and relabelling the cpy as LCH.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Amita
