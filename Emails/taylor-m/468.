Janice,

Following your earlier request to Robert for the liquids GTCs, I attach the 
latest versions that we have developed.  Apart from a couple of minor 
additional comments from London Tax we currently have no further amendments 
that we wish to make to these documents.

If you have any queries please feel free to contact Justin or myself.

Kind regards, Edmund.
