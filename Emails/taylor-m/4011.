As per my voice mail and Mark's e-mail, Mark would prefer to eliminate 
NetWorks from the review process.  Do you think Andy will object to 
eliminating NetWork's from the process?  Instead, he prefers to instruct all 
traders to flow all necessary documentation through Mark Greenberg or myself 
to ensure consistent legal review.  I have revised the policy accordingly.

Please review and let me know what you think.

Leslie
