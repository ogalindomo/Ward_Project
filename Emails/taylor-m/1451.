Last year we pre-registered approvals to trade Coal in Europe on EOL - which 
was a bit premature. 

The commercial team are now ready to proceed with 'getting online' and have a 
standard contract that Robert and Peter have worked on with which I believe 
we can look to finalise the details of descriptions for EnronOnline. (copy 
attached)

Please can we get together early next week to go through the steps required 
to get this up and running?
