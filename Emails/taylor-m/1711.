Subject: EnronOnline procedures and GTCs

Attached are the GTCs that I have revised to address tax issues that would 
arise from counterparties with no Australia presence. I am content settlement 
provisions already covered in the documentation. I have also developed a 
checklist for new counterparties. Would you pass onto Chris Catt at PW for 
his signoff.
