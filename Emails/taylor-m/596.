Mark,

I have arranged for an Ericsson 1888 World phone to be sent to your hotel in 
Munich, Germany.  It has been guaranteed to arrive by 12.00 noon tomorrow, 
Friday 27th August.

The mobile number for this phone is 07881 512535, an International Mail Box 
Number has been set up and an instruction sheet should be inside the box on 
how to access messages whilst abroad.  

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.

Regards
Nikki
