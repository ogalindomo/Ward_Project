Attached is a revised draft of the Put Option Confirmation, reflecting
comments received from Anne this morning.  I have attached both a marked and
an unmarked copy.
As discussed with Anne, I will make conforming changes to the Term Sheet and
updates to reflect a couple of additions to the Put Option Confirmation that
were in the last draft but that are not in the term sheet to the extent such
additions are not beyond the scope of the Term Sheet.
