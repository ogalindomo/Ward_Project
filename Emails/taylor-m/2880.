Mark,

The above-referenced agreement would allow EnronOnline to obtain delayed Dow 
Jones data from Reuters.

Dow Jones has said that they cannot agree to arbitration.  I pointed out to 
them that they have agreed to it in the past (the content provider agreement 
that was executed earlier this summer b/t Dow Jones and Enron Net Works.

DJ has said that the previous deal was with "a different Dow Jones business" 
and that they can't agree to arbitration on this deal.

Please advise.

Jason
