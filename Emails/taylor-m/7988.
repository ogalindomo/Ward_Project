Subject: Dynegy Direct

Justin,

Tracy Wallace was around earlier and was asking why her application to Dynegy 
Direct was still pending approval.  (my understanding from speaking with 
Amita is that you are not sure about some of the Legal language?)

Can you please give Tracy a call and let her know what's going on?  I didn't 
feel comfortable explaining since I'm not sure that I know all of the issues 
on this one.

thanks,
lara
