Hello Mark --

Here is the initial list of companies for which we will likely need new 
NDAs.  I believe that at least one Enron company has an NDA in place with 
each of these companies already.  

Ariba, Inc.
Commerce One, Inc.
EDS Corporation
IBM Corporation
i2 Technologies, Inc.
Microsoft Corporation
Oracle Corporation
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
SAP Corporation
Sun Microsystems, Inc.
TIBCO Inc.

Thanks.
