Hey you guys.... 

Just a quick bit of info for you regarding HI 177.? The reason the 
measurement is so inconsistent is the the readings are received from a 
telephone line that has been out for some time.? This platform offshore is 
unmanned, therefore our measurement group relies on the telemetry from the 
phone lines.? So, to make a long story short, the measurement you are seeing 
in probably wrong.? The lead data is showing that the measurement number is 
the same from the 3rd through the 18th, which cannot be right.? They are 
working on it, but to be honest with you, these people don't get in a hurry 
for anything.? When I get better numbers from a crew going offshore, I will 
put them in, probably tomorrow.? In the meantime, your imbalance will be 
changing.

Just wanted you guys to be more informed. 

Take care and keep in touch when you can. 

(I miss you guys...............)
