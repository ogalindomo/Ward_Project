Subject:  North Terrebonne Processing Plant - Notice of Force Majeure

Transco received the following notice today from the operators of the
Terrebonne plant.

 "In accordance with Article XVII of the above referenced
agreement please be advised that the North Terrebonne Gas Processing
Plant and Tebone Fractionation Plants shut down yesterday, May 10,
2001.  The shut down was due to a propane leak on the suction side of
one of the refrigeration compressors at North Terrebonne.  An incident
investigation team is preparing to investigate the exact cause of the
leak.  Present estimates of the duration of the shut down are uncertain
but may be as long as three to five days."

As a result of this outage, delivery points on Transco will see a
temporary increase in the heating content (Btu) of the quantities
received from the Transco system.  Transco expects the situation to be
alleviated shortly per the above notice and will provide an update as
it is received from the plant operators.

If you have any questions, please contact your Transportation
Scheduling Representative.
