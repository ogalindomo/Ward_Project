Thank you for taking time-out to call George Roberts at KKR prior to the O-I Board meeting yesterday.
"As you can gather, we are stalled with O-I, in part because the executive management seems preoccupied with other issues to the point where it is reticent to engage with the O-I decision makers appointed to negotiate with Enron."
"Hopefully, with some interest at the Board level, O-I executive management would be motivated to direct its negotiators to engage and finalized the deal."
Please advise me if there is any follow up to be completed through you or directly with Mr. Roberts.
