"Mr. Lay--During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party wouldcontribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Bottssuggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligationagainst other contributions that they solicited."
"After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg thatyou did not want to be competing with the Rockets in solicitingcontributions to the Arena referendum campaign."
"Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for theRockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that theyhave solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta."
Mikesuggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons thatwould be solicited by the Rockets.
Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.
You or Rosaleemay call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail atmtelle@velaw.com.
"Sincerely,Michael S. Telle"
