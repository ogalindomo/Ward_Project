How kind of you and Enron to think about employees like myself who have lost a beloved family member and who are having a hard time during this holiday season.
"Dr. Williams' session below was very helpful, and I ran into 3 fellow employees that I work  with that I didn't even know were going through a similar situation."
Thank you very much.
Happy Holidays to you and yours.
