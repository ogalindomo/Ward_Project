Dear Governing Board member,

On behalf of Rajat Gupta, Chairman of the Indian School of Business (ISB),
I am writing to invite you to an informal meeting of the ISB on Sunday
January 28, 2001 from 1000AM to 1200Noon at the Belvedere Hotel in Davos,
Switzerland. This date and location coincides with the World Economic Forum
meeting in Davos. We know that several of you will be at Davos, and we
would like to take this opportunity to have an informal meeting like we did
earlier this year. Based on feedback from the last meeting, we have limited
the meeting to two hours only. I do hope you will join us if you are going
to be in Davos. We will send out a detailed note on the agenda and
logistics once we hear back from you.

With thanks and best regards,

Pramath Sinha
CEO, ISB
