Thank you for stopping by the Boardroom yesterday to congratulate me on my 
college graduation.  It is due to Enron that I have been able to achieve this 
lifelong goal.  I have also received unfailing encouragement, support, and 
flexibility from Cliff during this time.  Had it not been for Cliff, I would 
not have been nearly so successful.

My deepest thanks to the three of you.
