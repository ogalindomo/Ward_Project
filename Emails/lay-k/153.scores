I am the Libertarian Candidatefor Texas Rep. 147.
I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal.
"I was on thewinning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning sidethis year."
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its BoardMeeting tomorrow.
This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority ismaking to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions.
This is onemore reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a newarena that is not needed.
