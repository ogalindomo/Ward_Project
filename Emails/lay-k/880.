You have been asked to make some brief remarks on the changes at Enron at the 
EES employee meeting next Friday, and I put together the attached as a 
potential framework.  It provides an Enron problem list of 1985/86 versus 
today and a brief look at our different visions.

If I can do something else, I'll be back Monday morning and will be happy to 
do so.
