Dear Sir,

I understand that Enron has just terminated
negotiations with regard to leasing some 1.5 million
sq.ft. of space at Canary Wharf in London.

I would like you to consider the London Dome. This has
sufficient space for all your needs, would provide a
high profile location, and I can put together a
package which would be financially extremely
beneficial to Enron.

Please reply to me at samberkovits@yahoo.com
