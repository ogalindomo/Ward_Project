Ken,

I just wanted to drop you an email to touch base on the Institute.

Yesterday, I went to see Stuart's workshop of three new original musical
theatre productions at UH. It was very exciting, and even more so knowing
that we can take his efforts to a new level with the establishment of the
Insitute.

Anyway, I just wanted to check in with you. I hope all is well, and look
forward to hearing back from you.
