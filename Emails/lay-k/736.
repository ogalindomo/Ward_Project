I received an email from MEC that they are close to identifying several board 
members and potential advisory board members.  More than a delay, I expect 
this will be the end of any discussions with respect to a formal relationship 
between Enron and MEC.

 I appreciate your help in organizing this and will update you if there is 
any change.

Thanks,
Mark
