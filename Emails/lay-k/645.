Sue asked me to send following  information:
?
Sylvia will hold a news conference on Tuesday to  endorse the arena. The 
press advisory sent out today will cause many of them to  think she is going 
to oppose the arena. That's good because more of the media  will show up.
?
Her basic statement will be to reinforce her  position, as the city's fiscal 
watchdog, that this will not take one dime away  from basic services and will 
indeed help the city keep growing and thus have  more funding for city 
services---especially the $13 million a  year that the Arena will generate in 
sales taxes and the increase in property  values downtown.
?
It will be great if Mr. Lay could show up at the  event and that Sylvia for 
her support and objective analysis of the arena  benefits.
