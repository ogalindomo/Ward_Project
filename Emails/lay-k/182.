Gentleman,
We will need a brief (1-2 paragraphs) bio from your office for the TFA
business plan.  I already have one from Peter Douglas.  Scott, we need yours
updated.  With these bios and a few other appendices, the plan is almost
ready to send out for your review prior to our board meeting.  The meeting
is scheduled for Tuesday, September 19 at 3PM on the 50th floor of the Enron
Building, 50M03.  Your bio can be forwarded directly to Justin Cornett at
the email address above or mailed or faxed to the TFA office at the address
listed below.

Thanks,

Will
