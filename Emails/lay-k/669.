The WSJ is doing a profile on Fred and Fialka has asked Fred to suggest
some people he should talk to about him.  Fialka is particularly interested
in business leaders who know Fred personally.  If you are willing to talk
to him I'd appreciate it.  If you feel comfortable in doing so, I  thought
you might be able to talk about your having worked with him on PCSD and
other fora - - about the fact that he is passionate about environmental
issues and the need to achieve results but can work with business and
politicians of both parties to find ways to solve problems...that he's not
stuck to one approach...that he's pragmatic, focused on getting results.

Please let me know if you feel comfortable in our giving Fialka your name
to talk to.
