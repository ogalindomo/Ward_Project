"I recently had the privilege to attend a speech given by Gene Kranz, who was in charge at NASA for many space flight missions, including the disastrous Apollo 13 mission."
"He has written a book called ""Failure is not an Option""."
"He speaks of teamwork, discipline and approaching the unexpected with an attitude that excludes failure."
"In short, his speech was great!"
"I don't know if/where this sort of speaker would be helpful to Enron, but I wanted you to know about him."
"Volunteer Houston brought him to town, so I'm sure they know how to get a hold of him."
"I realize he is not a corporate organization expert, but he's one heck of a motivational speaker."
Hope this is helpful.
