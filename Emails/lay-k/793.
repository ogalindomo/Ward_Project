NOTE:  THIS IS A RE-SEND OF A PREVIOUS MESSAGE THAT WAS NOT RECEIVED BY MANY
OF YOU

All,

Since the overwhelming majority of you can participate in a conference call
on Monday November 20 at 5 p.m. EST, we suggest locking that in now.  So
please put it on your schedule.

The dial-in number will be:  1-888-622-5357; participant code 550894.

I will only need your comments in advance if you cannot attend the
teleconference on the 20th.  If you cannot attend, please contact Valerie
Petersen at 203-432-6035 to set up a time for a pre-conference call between
the two of us.  You may also get your comments to me in writing.

Best,
Jeff
