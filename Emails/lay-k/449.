Just a word of thanks to Enron for its Vision & Values.  I have just read 
them again and found them up lifting.  

I am writing you because prior to working for Enron, Ken Lay and Enron were 
synonymous.   I had not known the value and respect that Enron had for it's 
employees.   Great belief.

Thanks again for the words of encouragement (Vision & Values)
