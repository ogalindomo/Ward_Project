"After some major soul searching and frustration, Jose Luis and I talked last night and we are considering moving the date one week back to June 3 in hopes of avoiding a number of the problems we are currently having."
"I want to know if any of you have any major conflicts with this date and Linda K, as soon as the hurrican passes, will check with the Four Seasons for availability (which was our first choice from the beginning)."
We love you all and I'm hoping this doesnt' change anyone's schedules too much.
"Love, Lizp.s."
"Sharon, if you talk to the Four seasons, can you check on that date."
Thanks
