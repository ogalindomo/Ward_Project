Dear Mr. Lay,


With reference to my email dated 11/10/2000 introducing Tata Housing as a
premium real estate developer in India, we had mentioned the availability o=
f
our premises, Technopolis KnowledgePark being a ready to move in building
with all the facilities required for a good Call Centre.  Further, we also
mentioned that Tata Housing has a large land bank and can offer properties
to Enron for Call Centres across the country.

We would like to make a clarification wherein the words =01&Call Centres=01=
8
should read as =01&Data Centres=018.

Thanking you

Yours faithfully,
TATA HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CO. LTD.
