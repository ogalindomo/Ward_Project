"Good morning,I am not sure if you are aware of the recent statements by the PrimeMinister of Canada, on his recent political trip to Whitehorse, Yukon."
Hemade some erroneous statements regarding Canada's position on the ANGTSproject and Canada's requirements for any project.
The attached Official Background brief was issued by the PMO (PrimeMinister's Office) in Ottawa.
"As you can see from the brief, Canada doesnot agree that Foothills or the ANGTS project has exclusivity on a projectfor delivering gas from Alaska."
"Furthermore, Canada will ensure that anyproject in the north will give maximum economic benefit to northerners."
I hope you find the attached document informative.
"If you have any furtherquestions, please feel free to give me a call at your convenience."
"Best regards,Bruce - Backgrounder PMO.doc"
