PASS THIS ON TILL IT REACHES EVERYONE BY ELECTION TIME

Our Senators and Congressmen don't pay in to Social Security, and, of
course, they don't collect from it.The reason is that they have a
special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago.
For all practical purposes, it works like this:

When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die,
except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living
adjustments. For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be
expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275,000 during
the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span
for each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in
on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or
Congressman.

This fine
retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we
who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.
Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so
desirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could
increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that
works so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who
aren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security
could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the
Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,
and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast
they fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them
along the way,  might be able to help.

How many can YOU send it to ??
