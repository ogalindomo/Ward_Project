"We have received several responses to Sidney's letter to shareholders, bothpositive and negative."
A few shareholders indicated that copies of theirresponse would be sent to board members.
We are very interested in allletters received from our shareholders and would appreciate it if you wouldplease forward to us any letters that you receive.
We prefer that you notrespond to any letter that you may receive relative to this matter as weare collecting all letters and will respond to them as appropriate.
"Ifyou have any questions, please contact me."
Thanks for your help.
