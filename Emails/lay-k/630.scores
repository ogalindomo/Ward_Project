It was good to see you again this week.
"I talked with Wayne Sanders and TomFalk, and we would very much like to get together with you for a meeting inDallas possibly in December."
Wayne asked that we include Jeffrey Skilling.
"I have asked Jeanine Jankowski, my assistant, to help arrange the meeting inDallas."
Jeanine will be contacting your assistant.
