The WSJ is doing a profile on Fred and Fialka has asked Fred to suggestsome people he should talk to about him.
Fialka is particularly interestedin business leaders who know Fred personally.
If you are willing to talkto him I'd appreciate it.
"If you feel comfortable in doing so, I  thoughtyou might be able to talk about your having worked with him on PCSD andother fora - - about the fact that he is passionate about environmentalissues and the need to achieve results but can work with business andpoliticians of both parties to find ways to solve problems...that he's notstuck to one approach...that he's pragmatic, focused on getting results."
Please let me know if you feel comfortable in our giving Fialka your nameto talk to.
