Ken: I had breakfast with Bill Ramsey this morning. He is currently the 
Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency in Paris and is in 
Washington to make contact with a variety of people. He had some excellent 
comments on what is happening across the globe in energy and environment. I 
suggested that he get directly in contact with you to share those details 
which could be of interest to you and President George W. Bush. Bill 
mentioned that there will be an IEA conference in Paris next May and he is 
likely to ask your participation. Bill as always has substantive things to 
say. See you in San Antonio. Joe
