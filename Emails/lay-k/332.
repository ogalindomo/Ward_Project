Fair this week.

EBS

Services, announced its first investment in Europe this week.  As part of a=

consortium of venture capital funds, EBV is helping provide development=20

A TECHNOLOGY UPDATE FROM IT'S MARK PICKERING. . .

Sametime, a new communication tool, is coming to screens across Europe and,=
=20
in the future, throughout Enron's offices worldwide.   What is Sametime? It=
's=20
a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and=20
receive text messages to/from Enron colleagues. Sametimeis not a replacemen=
t=20
for email or the phone, but rather it should complement both exiting=20
communication tools. This is a tool that will be of most value to people wh=
o=20
spend a lot of time at their PC, but who want to ask a question of someone,=
=20
conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time, without havin=
g=20
to pick up the phone or compose an email message.
Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities. The green square tells=
=20
you who is online and able to receive a message, while the red dot gives a=
=20
simple indication of people who may be away from their desk (see screen=20
sample below).
I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my=
=20
team. It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other=20
offices, especially Houston (you can even use it on the road!). A nice=20
feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit =
on=20
their screen until they read it.  Sametime'susefulness falls under the=20
=01+Network=01, effect, i.e. the more people online, the greater the benefi=
t.
Sametime will be available on your desktop in the not too distant future, s=
o=20
watch out for further details.  Looking forward to sametiming with you soon=
