"Here in my group, and all over Enron, I see people working hard while some even go above and beyond."
"I am in my mid-thirties and will speak for so many in saying THANK YOU for your hard work, great planning and sacrifice made in the early years long before we came here to enjoy all the extra benefits provided."
"My family and I, along with so many others, appreciate the rewards you provide for hard work."
There is no way we can say it enough.
"Thanks again,Corry BentleyPlease, no response necessary."
