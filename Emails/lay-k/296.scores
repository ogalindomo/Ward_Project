Steve Burns placed a call to the Bolivian Embassy on Friday afternoon.
I followed up with a phone call to Ambassador Marlene Fernandez today resulting in kudos from the Ambassador to Ken Lay and the Enron team for playing a pivotal role in the meeting with President Clinton and President Banzer in NYC.
