 I thought you might be interested in the new book by Baruch Lev on
"Intangibles." It will be published in March but if you'd like to take an
early look at it, you can check it out on Baruch's Web site.

 The title of the book is Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and
Reporting.

 You can download it from the following Web site:
