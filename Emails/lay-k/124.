Dear Family,
As you can see below, at 90 years young, Daddy (aka Pop-Pop) has his own
e-mail address and can be reached online.  I am sure that he would love to
hear from you from time-to-time.  I'm sure he would especially like to be
updated with recent photos of you and your families...me too!  If you have
any other family members e-mail addresses, let me know.  Big Kiss.  Love,
Linda/Mom/Aunt Linda
