Linda & Ken are beginning to make plans for the holiday and asked that I poll 
each of you re the following:

Where do you plan to spend Christmas eve and Christmas day?

If planning to come to Aspen, when arriving and departing?  # in your travel 
party?  

If traveling commercially, please provide carrier and flight # information.

PS -- I've heard back from Liz & Jose Luis - they are arriving Aspen 12/23, 
departing 12/30,
Natalie, Mark, & Zach arrive 12/26, depart 1/2.

Robyn, David, Beau - please respond ASAP.  Thanks.
