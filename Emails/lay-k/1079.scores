"This year, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has a new editor and a new production schedule."
"First, e-FFICIENCY NEWS has upgraded from a bimonthly to a monthlynewsletter."
"In order to make e-FFICIENCY NEWS more responsive, moreinteractive, and more useful, we need your help."
Please fill out a briefsurvey and tell us how to make e-FFICIENCY NEWS better fit your needs.

The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage theadministration to do the right thing.
Becoming an Alliance Activist is thefirst step.
"Become an Alliance Activist:<http://www.ase.org/takeaction/activist>Read the Alliance information page and send a letter to President Bush:<http://www.ase.org/takeaction/alert03-16.htm>********************************EFFICIENCY NEWSSenator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy BillSenator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy."
"``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need acomprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and tousing energy more efficiently throughout the economy."
"I believe thislegislation sets out that plan,"" Bingaman said."

--------------------------------Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental RelationshipAlliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate EnvironmentCommittee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies andenvironmental policies.
"Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is nowour nation=01,s second largest energy source."
He also offered a series ofrecommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy andenvironmental goals.

"Also on their new consumer site is a =01&savings calculator.=018Take the quiz and see the consumer information at:<http://www.simplyinsulate.com/>--------------------------------IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate ChangeThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third andfinal volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, whichexamines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=nusing energy wisely."
"The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,transportation, and industry could account for more than half of thepotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020."
"Natural gastechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=dpower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plantemissions."
"And ""low-carbon energy systems,"" such as renewable energy, canalso make an important contribution."
"Perhaps equally important is thefinding that there is ""no single path to a low emission future."""

"The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in aseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hiddencosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies fromoperating efficiently."
SPRU says that understanding the size and nature ofthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change throughimproved energy efficiency are to be successful.
These policies must succee=din the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=edevelopment of a broadly based energy service industry.

"This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, morethan are built in 42 states."
One of the main reasons for adopting the codeis the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of theTexas state plan for controlling smog.
"Since the IECC contains a newstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=genergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants thatserve the air conditioning load."
"The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=eTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOGstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=eProject and Alliance Associates."
"--------------------------------Alliance Associates Honored with AwardsMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star AwardsCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and theDepartment of Energy."
