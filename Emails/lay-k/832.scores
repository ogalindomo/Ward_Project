We are completing a telephone systems audit that involved sweeping executive and executive assistant telephones and workspaces for listening devices.
This sweep included your telephone(s).

Security:Each office was swept for radio frequency listening devicesEach telephone was opened and physically inspectedEach telephone line was checked for downline listening devicesAll executive and assistant extensions were programmatically evaluated to determine whether secondary, unknown telephones were associated with the same extensionNo problems were found."
