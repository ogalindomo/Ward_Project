Paul and I met with Frank Savage, President & CEO of Alliance Capital
Managment International in NY today to see if he might be a good
prospect for the RFF Board.  Ken Lay arranged the meeting - Ken is on
the board of Howard University (where Frank is chair) and Frank is on
the Enron board.  Frank also knows Linda and John Deutch (from the
Council on Foreign Relations.)

We had a very good meeting - brought him upto speed on RFF and how we
are trying to expand our visability,esp in NY and in the financial
community, through events, the Council, etc.  Frank was very receptive
to our plans, thought we needed to focus on specific topics of interest
to the financial community and actions we could ask people to help
with.  He said he would love to come to Dod's breakfast in Feb.and
learn more about RFF.

Howard U. is clearly his biggest passion.  We need to send a letter
from Paul to him documenting previous conversations Paul has had with
folks at Howard about our fellowship programs and our desire to have
more African Americans apply.  He will show it to the President and
encourage him to act on it.)

Next step: Lesli ask Ken Lay to call Frank, see what he thought of us,
tell him more about his involvemnt on the Board, and see if Frank might
want to consider the Board over the next couple of months.
