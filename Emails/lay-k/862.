Hello again,  
?
Attached are?four  paragraphs that Len Baker, Dennis Powell, Pete Petersman, 
and I would like to  discuss with you today. We believe these paragraphs 
should be added to the  Garten Commission Report. They have to do  with:

Pooling  
Rule  FD  
stock options 
G4+1

I look forward to a  productive conversation today.
?
all  the?best,
John?

Len,
It looks good to me...I made a couple of minor  suggestions...they are in 
italics in the attached draft.? If you don't  agree with them I am ok with 
the document as it  is.

Rob and Dennis

Here is still another  revision of proposed FD rules.? I tried to reflect an 
additonal law  firms input as well as some press converage this week.

Please let me know your reactions.
