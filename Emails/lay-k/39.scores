Re: TCW Galileo Aggressive Growth Equities FundI spoke with Bob Hanisee from TCW and he confirmed that if you put any more monies into the fund before December 20th you would be subject to all of the capital gains for the year.
He recommended that we hold off until such time.
"I asked him to find out about the Small Cap Growth Fund and Select Equities Fund as well, so that we would be well informed about any similar circumstances."
