Use of the resources in this private area will soon allow you to:

- Reduce the time required for your sign-up process on the spot in Davos
for sessions held in conjunction with a meal. All you need to do is provide
your credit card details in advance through our secured website.

- Check your office mail through the kiosk. All you need to do is fill in a
form providing the technical parameters necessary for establishing the
connection. The parameters for this POP3 information can be supplied by the
technical support staff in your office.

- Access the content of the sessions of previous events and the details of
panellists at our meetings when you explore the latest version of the
Knowledge Navigator. The Knowledge Navigator provides summaries of sessions
from previous meetings and summits structured along themes, regions and
industries as well as a biography and contact information for each
panellist.

The Forum looks forward to your participation in Davos.
