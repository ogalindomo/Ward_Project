"Ken: It is my desire to retire from Enron at the end of March, 2001."
Thanks to you my financial position far exceeds what I had ever thought would be the case.
"I am still in great health, have plenty of competitive drive and have no desire to reduce my natural speed."
I shared with you my desire to seek an ambassadorship in a George W. Bush presidency.
Possibly the OECD where I think I can make a contribution.
You have been a great leader to follow and my entire family is grateful to you for the blessings and rewards you have brought to us.
My thanks to you.
I plan to inform Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro of my proposed date next week when I believe they will be in Washington to interview additional candidates as finalists in the search for my successor.
"JoePS: I enjoyed the time with you, Linda, Elizabeth and Jose Luis in Philadelphia."
