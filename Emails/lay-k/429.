Dear Jim,

Following our discussion last week, I am attaching a letter describing the
sort of position I am seeking, together with a detailed resume.  I've seen
John Wakeham, and given him a copy of the letter.  A signed copy of the
letter follows.

You probably don't have my up-to-date contact details:

Telephone:  Office - Switchboard 44 20 7273 8383;  Secretary (Carole) 44
20 7273 8357;  direct 44 20 7273 8341
       Home  44 1582 881334

Fax:  Office - 44 20 7273 8367

Once again, many thanks for looking into this for me.

Best wishes
