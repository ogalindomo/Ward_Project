"Harry,Thanks for your reply to my 20 trip rulesYes, Brenda and I are already planning our next group trip ( however, we haveonly been able to obtain 7 confirmations but not to worry, Macey is includedand I will make videos for you if we are unable to confirm space for you too.)"
"As to ""no other fool would walk with you in the morning,"" have you considereda deaf person might enjoy walks with you."
"And, Brenda and I go as a ""package"" so when you think of Brenda you cannothelp but include me....sorry."
"Finally, as to the spelling your name in the letter, my secretary made themistake when she retyped what Brenda and I wrote and faxed and E-mailed it toall."
"We would never miss the spelling of your name because we have alwaysthought it was a dichotomy that your last name included ""reason."""
Have a good trip.
John
