"It's really great how Enron helps out>in all of the funding of these great projects, but the disturbing thing>about it all, is that my Mother, who is an employee at your company, is not>allowed to be paid overtime for her very busy department."
"She's even>worked overtime for no pay, and is now threatened to be written up if she>doesn't leave between 5:00 and 5:30."
"I think it's a very dedicated>employee that will work for no pay, just make sure that the other>employee's at your company receive their correct compensations."
">My Mom has no idea I'm sending this, and would probably strongly discourage>it, but it's just something I felt I should do....>On the other hand, she loves what she does....I even tried to get>employment at your company because she raved about what a great place to>work it is."
"I think it's something that deserves looking into....>>Sincerely,>>Amy Coats>kelsey02@hotmail.com>>_________________________________________________________________________Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com."
