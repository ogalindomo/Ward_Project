Hi Liz -I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.
"He is still in business, just finishing up boots for the new President."
"Also, I have been called ""Precious"" and ""Baby"" this morning."
"Somehow, it just seems appropriate from him!!"
He is located at RJ's Boot Company and Shoe Shop3321 Ella Blvd.
