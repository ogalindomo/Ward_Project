We are trying to set up a brief meeting of the HR Committee meeting onThursday or Friday to look at the compensation package for a new CIO and aretention package for a current executive officer.
Larry Babbio is out of the office but his assistant has indicated thatThursday afternoon is likely to be the best time for him.
I'd appreciate your sending your availability for Thursday and Friday.
"Ifwe cannot arrange a meeting, we'd like to schedule a call with each of youindividually and use a unanimous written consent to authorize thecompensation matters."
We appreciate your help and regret the short notice immediately prior to aholiday weekend.
"Thanks,Linda"
