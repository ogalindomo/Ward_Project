Ken:

Here is a draft of your talk on "The Evolution of the Modern Energy Company."

I have it as a straight talk, but we could fashion together slides and drop a 
lot of this to talking points if you prefer.

There is some new historical material in the front to set up the heart of the 
talk; see if you think it is interesting enough as a lead in.

I'm on your calendar at 9:30 to discuss this or "The Future of Business" if 
you would like new information or changes.
