Red Herring values the opinions of our customers. Therefore, we would really 
appreciate your help in determining our new tagline.

Our current tagline - The Business of Technology - is felt to be somewhat 
limiting now that "the business of technology" has assumed great importance 
across all areas of business.

Therefore, please click on the survey link

 and let us know your opinion. The survey should only take a few minutes of 
your time, and would be incredibly valuable to us.

Thanks in advance for your support and participation.

Sincerely,

Red Herring Communications
