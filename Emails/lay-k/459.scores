"Our first Corporate Responsibility Task Force meeting will take place on Wednesday, October 25 from 10:30 am to 1:00 pm in the Enron Building - 50th floor boardroom."
I would greatly appreciate it if you could attend.
"I think it would send a strong message on the importance of this initiative if you could drop by, even for a few minutes."
"As you know, I will chair the meeting, assisted by Kelly Kimberly, Sr. VP of EBS, who heads our Corp Responsibility Initiative."
Thanks Ken
