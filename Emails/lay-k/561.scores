"We are still in discussions with MEC about a transaction, but it seems to be moving in the right direction."
They have asked to set up an advisory meeting in December to meet the senior team members.
Mr. Plotnick indicated that he expects to have his CTO in place by then.
I am trying to arrange our first meeting the week of December 5 or December 12.
Please send me a short list of times you have available for a two hour meeting.
"Once again, I would like to thank each of you for your help with this project."
