Ken,

I will be in Houston all day on Wednesday, Oct. 25 en route to Monterrey for
a Board Meeting on Oct. 26 and thought of how long it has been since we last
met.

If there is any chance you could fit me into your busy schedule for 15
minutes, I would be very appreciative.  As you may recall, I now manage
Darby - the emerging markets investment firm created by Nick F. Brady in
1994.

We have launched a number of new investment vehicles for Latin America.  Our
Latin American Mezzanine Fund aimed at helping finance infrastructure
projects is still the only one of its kind in the Region.  There should be
some interesting opportunities for Enron and Darby to work together.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best personal regards,

Richard H. Frank
