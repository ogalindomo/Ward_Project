"My consulting assignment at Azurix will end next month, so I've put calls in to Cliff and Mark Metts to see if either of them needs help with either corporate trouble-shooting, or M&A execution."
I thought I should also ask a related question of the two of you: anything that I could assist you with?
"As to the question whether I can be helpful, I believe that Colin, John, and Michael have been pleased with my contributions, though you should ask them directly."
Please let me know if you have any ideas.
Thanks.
