The Executive Committee will meet on Tuesday, 12 September  to review /ratify 
the results of the VP PRC and Analyst and Associate PRC, and to conduct the 
MD PRC.  The meeting will be held in the Ballroom of the Hotel St. Regis, 
1919 Briar Oaks Lane, Houston (a map is attached below).  Breakfast will be 
served starting at 7:00 am, and the meeting will commence at 8:00 am.    A 
copy of the meeting agenda is also attached below for your information.

On the day of the meeting, in addition to the data on results of the VP and 
A/A PRC's, you will be provided with biographic profiles and supplementary 
data on the   MD's under review.    Due to the sensitivity of this 
information, we have opted not to deliver the MD profiles in advance of the 
meeting.   

Should you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact 
me on extension 5-3377.  Many thanks
