"Re: CNBC Advance Notice: Decimal-based PricingI want to advise you that as of this Monday, Aug. 28, CNBC will begindisplaying all quotes and price changes in decimals (dollars and cents)instead of fractions."
"As you know, the securities industry as a whole is headed towards decimal -based pricing."
"Both the NYSE and the NASDAQ plan to gradually change overto decimals to comply with the SEC's mandate of total decimal conversion byApril 9, 2001."
"By making the full move to decimals all at once, we arepreparing CNBC viewers for this eventual industry-wide changeover."
I welcome any comments from you or others in your organization about thesechanges or other aspects of CNBC coverage.
Please let me know if you wouldlike to be removed from our ongoing notification list or add others in yourorganization.
