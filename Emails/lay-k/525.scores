"Ina humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awarenessproject and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-insertedsunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditionerstandards."
Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peakelectricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands createdand threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations.
"This proposedlegislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing forinput from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the finalrule."
"http://www.ase.org/media/newsrel/press.htmTo see four flaws in the DOE analysis:http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/doeflaws.htmTo send an email to Secretary of Energy Richardson urging strong airconditioner standards:http://www.standardsasap.org/accac.htmTo view the ad, visit the Appliance Standard Awareness Project at:http://www.standardsasap.org/wpad.pdf--------------------------------Winter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New ReportThe U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas priceswill increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter overlast winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter FuelsOutlook, released on October 6."
"Home heating oil prices are expected to riseby $190 per home from last year's already high prices in the Northeast,while electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent."
"Predictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalateeven further should the weather prove to be colder than normal."

"A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energyefficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE'sOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94million, or 13 percent over the previous budget."

"--------------------------------Avoid Home Energy $ticker $hockIf you thought it was expensive to pay up to $2 a gallon for gas thissummer, you'll have continued ""$ticker $hock"" when your home energy billsarrive this winter with predicted increases."

"--------------------------------Energy Heats Up ElectionEach presidential candidate stated his energy policy in the firstpresidential debate in Boston, MA, on October 3."
"Vice President Al Gore'splan focuses on increasing supply and decreasing demand, while TexasGovernor George W. Bush's plan emphasizes developing domestic energysupplies."
"The vice presidential candidates faced off in Danville, KY onOctober 5, both echoing the positions of their presidential running mates."
"Source: Washington PostFor a comparison of the Presidential candidates on energy issues:http://washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/comparison_energy.htm--------------------------------California, New York Make Dramatic Boosts for Energy-Efficiency FundingIn California, bills signed by Governor Gray Davis last week re-assertCalifornia's leadership status on support for energy efficiency and otherclean energy sources."
"Two bills extend California's system benefits chargethrough 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5billion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012."
This may be thelargest clean energy fund ever created.
A third major bill will speed theadoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards.
"These measuresare expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and tolessen future energy reliability problems."
"To see complete bill texts:http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1194_bill_20000831_enrolled.htmlhttp://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_0951-1000/ab_970_bill_20000831_enrolled.htmlAnd in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that willmeet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewableenergy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management."
"http://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htmThe New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing thestate's System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 millionper year, and extending it for five years."
About 70 percent of the current$78 million is used for energy efficiency programs.
"If this formula holds,efficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percentincrease from current levels."
Energy advocates are seeking SBC fundingcloser to the $200 million level.

"Including the 2001 model year, this guideranks the fuel efficiency of vehicles in various class sizes."
The ToyotaPrius and Honda Insight currently top the list for fuel efficiency.

"Afirst-time event involving utilities and retailers across the U.S., theprogram encourages consumers to trade in halogen lamps for cooler, ENERGYSTAR labeled, efficient models."
Each halogen torchiere that is replaced byan ENERGY STAR torchiere can save $25-$50 per year in energy costs.

"The Fairburn Commons complex inan Atlanta suburb opened with 33 units, each of which will cost less than$1/day to heat and cool."
"http://www.doe.gov/news/releases00/seppr/pr00240.htmMeanwhile, the National Affordable Housing Network released a report on newenergy-efficient, affordable homes built in Texas."
"Built in partnership withHabitat for Humanity International, these 40 homes use up to 42 percent lessenergy than an average new home."
Reduced monthly energy bills areparticularly critical for low-income residents.
