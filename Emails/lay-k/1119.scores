The schedule isas I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with theevents at the Ministerial dinner.
"Here, while we are still intending thatMr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerialparticipants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly toaccommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule."
We will keep you posted.
I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECDfor our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participantsfor use during the sessions.
I look forward to hearing from you.
"Best wishes,Jonathan Pershing"
