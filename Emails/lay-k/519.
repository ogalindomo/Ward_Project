Wouldn't it be great to be named Most Innovative six years straight?

Anything is possible at Enron.  You were selected to participate in this 
year's Fortune Survey of Corporate Reputations.  By now, you should have 
received a letter and a survey from Fortune.  The information you provide 
will be used to select America's Most Admired Companies, as well as the Most 
Innovative Company in America for 2000 (Enron, right?).  Please complete your 
survey and send it to me.  I am collecting all the surveys and will send them 
together to the Fortune analysts.  If you have already completed your survey 
and returned it to Fortune -- that's okay -- just let me know so I can mark 
your name off my list.

Thanks for you assistance.
