Dad,
We are not going to go to D.C. on the 16th as Jose
Luis needs to be back here for meetings on the 16th.
This just came up. He would like to meet with Lynn
Coleman at some time, but it may neet to wait until
later this month (depending on how things go this
Friday).
I hope you guys had a good time in Palm Beach. Houston
is FREEZING! Now we have perfect weather in Florida,
though with hight of only 78!
I'll see you this weekend.
Love,
Elizabeth
