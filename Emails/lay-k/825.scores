He is currently the Deputy Director of the International Energy Agency in Paris and is in Washington to make contact with a variety of people.
He had some excellent comments on what is happening across the globe in energy and environment.
I suggested that he get directly in contact with you to share those details which could be of interest to you and President George W. Bush.
Bill mentioned that there will be an IEA conference in Paris next May and he is likely to ask your participation.
Bill as always has substantive things to say.
See you in San Antonio.
Joe
