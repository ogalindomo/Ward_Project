Attached is the final draft of the press release relating to Project True 
Blue.  It has been approved by the deal team, outside counsel, and Investor 
Relations.  I propose issuing the release one hour after sending the proposal 
letter to True Blue's board.   True Blue should issue a press release 
acknowledging receipt of the offer as well as file the letter as part of an 
8-K.  True Blue's timing should be approximately one-half hour after our 
release.

Please send any comments to me at 34738, or reply to this email.
