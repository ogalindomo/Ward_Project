Subject: Be Careful!


I don't know if this is on the up and up, but its better to be aware.



>
 Please be extremely careful when you leave work and if at all
possible, do not leave alone when it gets late. A woman leaving work was
kidnapped yesterday at 6:30 from Lamar between the El Paso Bldg. and
Dynegy.  They drugged her but it appears that there was no rape.... the
police told her that about a month ago another girl downtown was also
kidnapped and raped ... so, please be careful!!!!!!!!

Please pass this on to your friends who work downtown.
