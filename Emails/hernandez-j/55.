Since we now fall under Enron Net Works......... our company/cc numbers have 
changed:

Our new Company Number is   083E (replaces 413)

Our new Cost Center is   103855  (replaces 105590)

Our Org I.D. is       01029349

When we get any news on the WBS Elements (use to be Work Orders) - I'll let 
you all know.

Thanks, Sandy
