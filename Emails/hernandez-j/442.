Subject: Prayer Requests from Wednesday November 8


Here are the prayer requests from Wednesday and I have added several emailed
prayer requests forwarded to me this week.  There are so many hurting
people.  It is great to know the Great Physician, isn't it?!!!

Sorry so late.  I pray that you will remember this one thing:

"I am your refuge and your strength.  Even though the earth gives way and
the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, do not fear.  I am an ever
present help in trouble."
Psalm 46:1-3
