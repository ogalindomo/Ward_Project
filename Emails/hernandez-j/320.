Brenna,

For Confirms in which a Counterparty writes a decimal number next to our 
Option Premium Dollar Amount, consider these Confirms ok to Execute unless 
the Premium is crossed out and a new dollar amount is noted.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

Would you mind emailing your message to me regarding the numbers written in 
on the confirmations?  I head the voice mail that you left for Eve, and I 
would like to try to keep written documentation of these things as well.  
Just something short would be fine whenever you have a chance.

Thanks for your help Joe.

Brenna
