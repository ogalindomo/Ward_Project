Hi,
        go into EHRonline - just as you would to do your time sheets.
Above the area "TimeSheets (CATS)" - you can also click on above section 
"Work Contacts" and/or "Personal Information".
And below topics also may have fields you can check
Selecting the topics - should open the screen/ fields in each section (with 
red arrows to those we can update).

thanks,
Sandy
