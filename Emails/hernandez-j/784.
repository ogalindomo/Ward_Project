12/26/2000 Note -- PJM Pilot Program

PJM is implementing a pilot program effective 0900 Thursday, December 28, 
2000. 

PJM is reducing the time required to request a change to an existing 
interchange transaction and purchase hourly transmission from 30 to 20 
minutes. 
Changes to interchange transactions will continue to be guaranteed with 30 
minutes notice. 
Changes will be accommodated with 20 minutes notice on a best effort basis. 
To accommodate the reduced notification time for interchange transactions, 
transactions without a linked NERC Tag will not be approved until a Tag is 
linked. Transactions that remain untagged 20 minutes prior to the transaction 
start time will be rejected. As always, transactions without a NERC Tag will 
hold ramp.
