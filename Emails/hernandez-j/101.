If you are working in Livelink and you notice that it is not working properly 
or not working at all, please let me or Mark know as soon as possible. We are 
then responsible for alerting other users not in our group and also 
contacting someone in IT.  If you happen to be the person that becomes aware 
of this problem, please make a point to come and tell me or Mark at that 
time.   

Thank you!
