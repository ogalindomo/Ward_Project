> The Elmo Misunderstanding
>
> A new employee is hired at the Tickle Me Elmo factory. The personnel
> manager explains her duties, and tells her to report to work promptly at
> 8:00 AM.  The next day at 8:45AM, there's a knock at the personnel
> manager's door. The assembly line foreman comes in and starts ranting
> about this new employee.  He says she's incredibly slow, and the whole
> line is backing up.  The foreman takes the personnel manager down to the
> factory floor to show him the problem.  Sure enough, Elmos are backed up
> all over the place.  At the end of the line is the new employee. She has a
> roll of the material used for the Elmos and a big bag of marbles.  They
> both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two
> marbles, and starts sewing the little package between Elmo's legs.   > The
> personnel manager starts laughing hysterically. After several minutes, he
> pulls himself together, walks over to the woman, and says, "I'm sorry, I
> guess you misunderstood me yesterday. Your job is to give Elmo two test
> tickles."
