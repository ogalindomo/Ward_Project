Here is a copy of section from previous document..................
        reminder ...............most of us will not enter any hours on Dec. 
25th or 26th.

Please READ: (original was sent to us prior to July 4th)

Resolution, Instructions or Action Plan:

For eligible employees, SAP has July 3rd and 4th (and all Enron recognized 
holidays) built into the work schedules.

1) Full-time exempt / non-exempt employees will not have to enter HOL for 
July 3rd-4th, in most cases.

 Exceptions:  9-8-1's with Monday, July 3rd is a "scheduled" off day.  
                                 4x10 (Tuesday-Friday), July 3rd is a 
"scheduled" off day.
 These employees are eligible for a holiday (HOL) on another day (floating 
holiday per management discretion).
 Use HOL absence and attendance type when recording this time.

2) Part-time employees, including reduced hours employees, can code July 3rd 
and 4th as either HNP (Holiday No 
Pay), REG (if worked) or POD (Paid Off Duty)

3) What if I work the holiday? 
     Working the holiday is the same as working on a day off.  Code "REG" and 
the number of hours worked on that day. 
      In regards to additional compensation, please refer to the policies and 
procedures document on the HR Web Site.
    
 Contractors and temporary employees are not eligible for Holiday Compensation
