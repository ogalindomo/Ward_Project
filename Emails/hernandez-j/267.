Subject: Stacey's Baby Shower

We are copying an idea presented for Bernice's baby shower for Stacey, but 
with a Holiday flare. Stacey wasn't planning on putting up a Christmas tree 
since she's been having it rather rough here lately. SO, we are doing a 
'Money Tree', or actually, a 'Money Christmas Tree'. Susan & I will be 
purchasing a small artificial Christmas tree & decorating it with baby 
booties and such. Anyone who would like to donate $ rather than purchase a 
gift is welcome to participate. We will be tucking the money into the little 
booties & topping the tree off with a Baby's First Christmas ornament. That 
way, little baby Richardson will have a Christmas Tree, mommy can buy what 
she wants/needs, and the booties can be taken off & worn to keep the 
ittle-bittie baby toes warm in the winter. We will be collecting donations 
thru Thursday afternoon. We will have a card available to sign for those who 
wish to join in.

If you have any questions please call Susan (59989) or Cyndie (31443).

Thanks!!
Cyndie
