Dear all-

Regarding PG&G Energy Trading - Power, L.P executed Enron Confirmation 
Letters:
PG&E tends to place a stamp (disclaimer) at the bottom of Enron 
confirmations, please execute the documents if nothing else has been altered, 
and has been signed by both counterparties.  I have asked Rhonda Denton in 
our group and she said it was a disclaimer.   If nothing else has changed and 
you all have proof read the stamp to make sure the stamp has not changed; we 
do not have to see the document through the Livelink process.  You all can 
track execute and file.
Please call with any questions.
Thank you
