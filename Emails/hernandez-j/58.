Hi, 
 in case you need to know.....
The Spring/Summer 1999 Hard Copy Enron Phone Books - may be the last paper 
phone book we'll ever have for Enron.     So, if some of the common numbers 
or unchanged information is helpful to you, please keep your book.

Per Facilities, there is a task force to see if the On-line book can be 
redesigned to better incorporate the international offices, as well as stay 
up with all the Enron changes.

FYI - Enron is currently having approximately 500 employee changes - per week.
Per Facilities, it is due to both the growth and the moves.

Thanks,
Sandy
