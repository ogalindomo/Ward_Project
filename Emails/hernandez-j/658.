 <<REASON_.doc>>    I thought this was a sweet little verse but that last
paragraph about sending it to 100,000 of your nearest and dearest just ruins
it.  Then I bbc'd to lots and lots of you so no one would know who was
getting it from me.  If you start getting duplicates, well, at least I
tried.  It prints out really nice on a color printer.  Let me know if you
need a copy.
