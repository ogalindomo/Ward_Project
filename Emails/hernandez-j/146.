As Enron finalizes plans for our child care center scheduled to open during 
the 3rd quarter of next year, we would like your input on 3-5 alternatives 
for names for our center. We will be holding open forum type focus groups on:

December 11th and 12th in room EB49C3 from 11 am to 1 pm.


If your schedule allows, we would love to have you stop by and provide your 
feedback.  

Thanks for your assistance in naming our center! We look forward to seeing 
you next week!

Regards,

Charla
