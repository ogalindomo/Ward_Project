Hello Everyone,

I will be coordinating with IT to ensure our migration to Outlook 2000 (GEM 
Project) happens smoothly and successfully.  I will inform you of information 
needed or timelines as I am made aware of them.  I'm in the process of 
providing them the initial information for our group.  After they receive it 
they will send me more details of how the process will take place and how 
long it will take to complete.  Please hold your questions until you receive 
that email.  If you have something you would like to address after you 
receive that e mail we will proceed as needed.

The first step for you, is to go through your lotus notes and start wiping 
out personal e mails and data that can be converted to a spreadsheet or word 
document.  We will have access to our lotus notes for a period of time (will 
have to get specifics from IT) but will not be sending or receiving e mails 
through the Lotus Notes Database once we have migrated over. 

Again, I will keep you posted as I receive information.  Thank you for your 
patience and cooperation in advance.

Julissa
