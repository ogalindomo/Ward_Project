Hi,  until Joe tells me otherwise, he needs to see all deals done with the 
Counterparty 'Enterprise Products Operating L.P.' if the counterparty 
signature has a stamp above it that says "By Enterprise Products GP, LLC, 
General Partner".  I will send around a copy tomorrow so that you can see an 
example of what I am talking about. 

I still do not have the list typed up from our meeting, but I will get the 
information to you as soon as I can!!

Thanks,
Brenna
