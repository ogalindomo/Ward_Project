Please go into your SAP profiles and check your Profile information for 
accuracy.
We should be able to edit or update certain fields.   Please make sure your 
Cost Center is 105590.
Should you have any trouble making changes please call me, and I'll help if 
possible, or ask HR to correct your information.
         Please advise when you've had a chance to handle (even if you do not 
have any changes).

thanks everyone,
Sandy
