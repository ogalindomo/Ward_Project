When we book out the Mapp/Option short position with UPA,  the purchase 
should be entered into Enpower as UPA.  When booking out the Mapp/Option 
length with Split Rock Energy,  the sale should be entered into Enpower as 
Splitrock.  All hourly deals done through Minnesota Power should also be 
entered into Enpower as Split Rock Energy.  If you have any questions, please 
let me know.

Thanks,
Laurel
