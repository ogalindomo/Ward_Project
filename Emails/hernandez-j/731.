Hourly traders and operators that need to see the overhead PI screens can now 
view them via the web regardless of where they are sitting.  They can be 
accessed through Internet Explorer from the new East Power Home Page, under 
the GENCO section.  Please contact Rick Broussard or Ramesh Swaminathan if 
you have trouble getting access.

They'll look a little different, but the information content is the same.
