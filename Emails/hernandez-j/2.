Carolyn and Dwight Dawson of the Teamleadership Center are hosting 3 Team 
Building sessions for everyone in Information & Records Management.  Lunch 
will be provided each day.

The surveys we handed out to some of you are for those who missed our first 
session with Dwight earlier this year.   Please have them back to me Friday 
morning.   Thanks everyone!
