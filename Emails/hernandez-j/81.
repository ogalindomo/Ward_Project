Any weather deals that you see that have WS and then a two-digit number need 
to be sent back to have our number written on them.  They should be returned 
to Celeste Cisneros.  I am not sure where she is located, but if you happen 
to find any of these, just ask and whoever does the run will make sure they 
go to the proper location.

Thank you!
