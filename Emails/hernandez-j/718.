All of the plant operations should be included on one of the deals listed 
below.  Just add a new leg to the correct deal number.  Plant generation 
should not be in the Hourly book.  If the hourly desk has taken a position, a 
Control Area ticket need to be created.


If you have any questions, please give me a call X3-4873 or steno 635

Thanks,
Laurel
