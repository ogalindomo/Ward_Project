Hello all

Some of Enron Confirmation Letters are able to fit on one page, example: Duke 
Energy Marketing and Trading LLC are often able to fit on one page (not all 
the time).  In the past Duke one page Confirmation Letters we coming over 
with a number 1 on the bottom, but both signatures (Enron and Counterparty) 
were included.  We have taken the page number out of the template and 
hopefully all is corrected.  If you see an Enron Confirmation Letter with 
both signatures included although it might have a Page 1 on the bottom, and 
no other changes, it is okay to Execute the Confirmation Letter.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know!

Thanks
