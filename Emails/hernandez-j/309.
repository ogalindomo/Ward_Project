The Flu Vaccine may come in and be available in the next couple of week.
Since Enron let us know in October to not rely on Enron alone for 
vaccinations, most of you may have already have shots.

But, if you plan to be vaccinated at Enron, they are taking requests by 
e-mail, and will contact those of the waiting list when the vaccine is 
here.   You would sign up using Health_Center.com.

For any other questions, call Health Center at x3-6100.

thanks,
Sandy
