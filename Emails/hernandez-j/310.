> Ice Cream for the Soul
>  author unknown
>
> Last week I took my children to a restaurant. My six-year-old son asked if
> he  could say grace.  As we bowed our heads he said, "God is good. God  is
> great.  Thank you for the food, and I would even thank you more if Mom
> gets us ice  cream for dessert. And Liberty and justice for all! Amen!"
>
> Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman
> remark, "That's what's wrong with this country. Kids today don't even know
> how to pray. Asking God for ice-cream!  Why, I never!"
>
> Hearing this, my son burst into tears and asked me, "Did I do it wrong? Is
> God mad at me?"
>
> As I held him and assured him that he had done a terrific job and God was
> certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table.  He
> winked at my son and said, "I happen to know that God thought that was a
> great prayer."
>
> "Really?" my son asked.
>
> "Cross my heart."  Then in theatrical whisper, he added (indicating the
> woman whose remark had started this whole thing), "Too bad  she never asks
> God for ice cream.  A little ice cream is good for the soul sometimes."
>
> Naturally, I bought my kid's ice cream at the end of the meal. My son
> stared  at it for a moment and then did something I will remember the rest
> of my  life.  He picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and
> placed it  in front of the woman.  With a big smile he told her,  "Here,
> this is for you.  Ice cream is good for the soul sometimes and my soul is
> good already."
>
> The End
>
> I loved the story, and I hope you like it too.
>
> Please keep it moving.
>
> God Bless.
