Here's a laugh for today:


In an emergency session of Congress, just completed, an official change to 
the name of one of the 50 United States will take place.  As of noon today, 
November 22, 2000 the state formerly known as Florida, will officially be 
renamed "Floriduh."  Please make  note  of the change.
