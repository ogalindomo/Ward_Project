Eve,

For the referenced counterparty, it is ok to Executed deals with a stamped 
signature line of Jocelyn Watson.  Also, Cinergy will write a number of days 
next to our Effective and Termination Dates.  This is ok as long as they do 
not cross out anything on our Confirms or adjust any of our dates.

Thanks,
Joe
