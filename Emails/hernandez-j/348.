Dear Carol,

I would like to put my brother Alejandro Vazquez on your prayer list.  He was 
taken into police custody Saturday night, November 18, 2000.  He was on his 
car with my dad and my son on the night of his birthday.  Police took him 
into custody, his attorney is trying this morning to stop deportation 
procedures.  He is to go to another hearing in front of Judge Atkinson on  
Wednesday morning, November 22, 2000.  My dad is taking it to hard and since 
this incident took place his high blood pressure keeps going up.  We need 
your prayers at this time for both of them.  On behalf of my brother, please 
keep him on your prayers for safety return home and to try to stop 
deportation procedures.  

God Bless,

Nelly Carpenter
