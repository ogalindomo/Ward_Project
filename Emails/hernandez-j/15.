Mark emailed me the current Time Tracking sheet that you all are using.  I 
have revised it to include spaces for numbers of each type of commodity that 
you track.  This way, rather than estimating numbers of different commodities 
tracked each week, we can get true numbers for Carolyn each month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Brenna
