Subject: Re: Thanksgiving thoughts forwarded from a friend  


I have a prayer request for you.  My dad was diagnosed yesterday with acute 
lukemia.  He is 86 years old but looks and acts more like someone in their 
late 60s or early 70s.  He is a wonderful Christian man (he's been a Baptist 
deacon for 40+ years).  Please pray that he will make the right decision on 
his treatment options and that he will not have to suffer.  Thanks.
