The conference room 37c1 is booked at 11:00 - and I believe Julissa plans to 
have extra tables available to set up our dishes.
 
Please see Julissa in 37c1 between 11:00 and 11:30 so she can tell us  how 
she'd like items arranged.

 In the meantime - please keep at your desk unless you need to put in a 
refrigerator on your floor.

The room is booked  (until 3pm), so we'll have plenty of time for going back 
for seconds, and for clean up.

Hope that answers most questions.   Thanks....Sandy
