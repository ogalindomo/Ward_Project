Hi Judy, Is Jennifer all right I heard they were in a car accident! I've
been trying to reach her because I know the kids party was canceled twice.
So I wanted to see if she was going to make one after all. Anyway, I tried
e-mailing her and no response. If you see her tell her I said hello and
hope that they are okay!

Take care,
Yvonne
