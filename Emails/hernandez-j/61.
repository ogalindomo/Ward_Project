Hey guys, 

What's going on strangers??  Haven't heard from you guys in a while,  I guess 
we are all busy in our own little world.  Just wanted to say hello and see 
how yall were doing.  I also have some SPECIAL NEWS I wanted to share with 
you guys.  Here it goes..........



My first and BIGGEST news is that Anthony and I are expecting, yes a BABY!  
I'm 3 1/2 months and due July.  So is everyone SHOCKED!  Sorry for delay in 
telling you guys but I had a little accident so I wanted to make sure 
everything was okay!  Everything is fine!  My second news is that we are also 
in the process of buying a house so hopefully that will turn out okay.  Now 
I'm realizing how much of a headache it is to do all this paper work and all 
the closing costs that add up.  If you homeowners have any tips for me pass 
them on I need all the help I can get.        I'll stop here cause I'm sure 
you guys don't have time to do all this reading.  Just wanted to share some 
of my good news with all of you. 

Love, 
Melissa
