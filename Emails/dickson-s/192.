Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Thanks
