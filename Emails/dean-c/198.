Dear George
I trust all is well. In advance of Kemm's presentation to your team on
Wednesday, I am attaching our WEFA Energy Services brochure to better
familiarize your team with the WEFA services available to you. I realize
Kemm will be focusing on Power, the brochure simply provides additional WEFA
background as a courtesy.

Regards, Peter
