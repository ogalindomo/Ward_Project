Hey Baby,

I dont know if this email looks like it's from me.  Anyway, I'm REALLY
tired.  I got probably about 6.5 hours of sleep but I guess it wasn't
enough.  It's gonna be a long week - okay 4 days.  I'm sorry about
waking you up last night.  I'm meeting Jen Garcia at 1 to work on the
project, but I should be home around 6.

Have fun working out tonight!  I will call you when I get home, but I
will try to email you again!

Love you,
Jenn

By the way-did you email my mom?
