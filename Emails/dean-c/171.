Steve, it looks like you can download the QSE application forms off the 
internet (see below).  Steve is going to coordinate the QSE application 
getting filled out and submitted to ERCOT.  Steve you should make sure to get 
sign-off on the application with Smith Day, Doug Gilbert-Smith, Mike Curry, a 
regulatory (Ron or Robin) and a legal person (Janet Moore) as well before it 
is submitted with ERCOT.  Thanks, - Mike
