Attached is the preliminary TTC/ATC calculations between CM/CSC Zones for On

South to North?? 3,700 - 3,800 MW 
West to North??? 1,100 - 1,200 MW 
West to South????? 500 -?? 600 MW 
North to South?? 1,100 - 2,300 MW 
North to West????? 800 -?? 850 MW 
South to West????? 300 -?? 350 MW 

We request SSWG review these calculations and provide any changes or updates 
no later than Friday May 4. 

Thanks Ken D.
