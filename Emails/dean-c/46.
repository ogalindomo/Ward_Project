Hey guys - my friends and I are throwing a little soiree at my place tomorrow 
night around 9 or so.  I know it looks like only guys are being invited to 
this deal, but I assure you there will be girls there too - they've already 
been invited.
If you want to bring beer/bottle/wine/whatever - that's fine, but no 
obligation - there should be plenty for everyone to eat, drink & meet Mary.  
Feel free to bring more people too.
I live on the corner of Fannin & Capitol in the St. Germain.  Park anywhere 
on the street & it's the walk-thru gate by the 2 garage doors.  The code is 
7890 - go through the hallway, veer to the left, up the elevator to #414.
