I'm sorry, baby.  I wish it wasn't the case.  The excuse is that he can't
find a hotel room on such short notice.  Also, Em and Ray are moving in
together and we're not at that step yet.  I'm not excusing the situation.
Besides, there really isn't any room for him-he's going to have to sleep on
the floor.  I wouldn't want you to sleep on the floor.

Love you,
Jenn
