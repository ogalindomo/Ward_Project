just keeping you in suspense, was i right?  10:30pm ringer off, fast asleep?  
j/j  my weekend was good.  stayed home friday (believe it or not) saturday, 
went to a graduation party, then went to a church concert, (it was really 
different, a rapping priest from Brooklyn) and then sunday me and the 
fam/grandparents/aunt and uncle all went to eat lunch....then back to church 
...that is all, was full as usual.
