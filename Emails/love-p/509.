There has to be an adjustment in TAGG, because both the FT ONT and FT NY 
books have captured this value and received the offsetting liquidation.  If 
the IM NY and IM ONT books have offsetting value you can roar reclass the 
difference.

Jim,  Were you able to locate this liquidation for April.  I realize it has 
been booked in TAGG between FT books, however, can you somehow get the value 
in  IM Ontario?  Let me know if I can provide you with any additional 
information that will help resolve this issue.

Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg
