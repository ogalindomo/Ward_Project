Phillip - this fall is nearing it's end for recruiting.  Schools are selected 
by an executive committee and program management.  I suggest that early next 
spring, you contact Celeste Roberts and discuss your request with her.  
Celeste is my Director, however she is out on maternity leave at this time.

Thank you
Shelly

Just curious how I may assist in getting Auburn University's name added to 
recruiting endeavors.  Of course I am an alum, and I believe you will find we 
have an excellent engineering and business school.  Just curious, thanks.
