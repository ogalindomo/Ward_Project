Phillip, I rejected your security request because you already had access to 
Sitara.  I just modified your existing security profile by removing your 
access to the East and granting you access to the Central desk.  In order for 
the change to be effective, you will need to get completely out of all open 
Sitara applications and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call 
me at x35423.
