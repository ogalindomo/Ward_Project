Just wanted to follow up with you guys on a conversation we had in a recent 
staff meeting.  I personally have noticed a dramatic improvement in the phase 
I process that Elizabeth is responsible for.  She has definitely become more 
comfortable with the process and we are seeing significantly less entry 
errors.  I checked with the others, and these comments seem to reflect 
everyone's feelings.  Just thought I would update you guys.  Thanks.
