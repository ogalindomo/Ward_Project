I have forwarded this message to Global Facilities, they set up locations, 
after they set up the location, then we can map the curves.

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change 
effective Feb. 1.

Thanks, George
