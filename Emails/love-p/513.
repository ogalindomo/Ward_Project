It was good talking to you today.  Brett's resume is below.  Could you please 
review it and forward it along as you see fit.

Thanks,

Jeff-

How is it going ?  My friend, Brett Turner, just graduated from LSU with a 
Masters in Finance.  He has a job offer from Credit Suisse First Boston in 
their London office, but would like to investigate opportunities in Houston.  
I reviewed his resume and it looks like he could be a good fit for Risk 
Management.  Brett is a sharp guy who is extremely motivated.  Could you 
please review his resume (attached) and let me know what you think.  

Try not to hold it against him that he is an LSU Tiger and a friend of mine.

Thanks,

CKL
