Christmas is upon us!!  Please see the below invitation and come join us on 
Thursday 12/14/00 in the 50th floor executive dining room.  If you have never 
seen the 50th floor decorated for Christmas, it should be a treat.  I hope to 
see you there.  If you cannot make it, Happy holidays and goodwill to all.
