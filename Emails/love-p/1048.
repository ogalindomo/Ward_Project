Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change 
effective Feb. 1.

Thanks, George
