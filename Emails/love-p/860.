Subject: Slight adjustment to Physical Tab Template

I have made a slight revision to the template regarding CPR Cash In and CPR  
Cash Out for consistency between Accounting, OA, and Economics.  

OA CODE 15 CASH IN  SALE
OA CODE 14 CASH OUT PURCHASE

Please replace the previous template with the one below.  





Thank You ,
Greg(37299)
