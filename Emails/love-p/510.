Just to keep you posted....

The offsetting liquidations($1,000,000 in revenue) for these two deals was 
sitting in the West Fred file.  It looks West already took this to the desk, 
so Theresa will get with Darren to reverse their take and reclass this to 
Central.

Thanks for your help with this.

the variances you have listed in january for lone liquidations for NNG - 
QN8046 - this is a storage deal and should go with sitara #588958 and QO0171 
should go with 590922.  We will have the same thing in February going the 
other way with these deals the sitara numbers there are 588959 & 591053 
respectively.  Shout with any questions.  This should explain about 900,000 
of the lone liquidation problem from January.
