Subject: Risk Meeting notes

Here are the top issues which the top performers in risk identified in this 
morning's meeting in no particular order:

1.  All physical curves out by 2:30.  All financial curves out by 3:15.  
2.  Streamline nightly checkout process.
3.  No more deal tickets.
4. Systems person or persons on the floor.
5. Notification of any curve change in the system.
6. Specific cut off time for all deal tickets.
7. Cross regional training
8. Stock options
9.  Back-ups for all big books
10. Combat Pay
11. Only 2nd yr analysts.
12. Automatic notification when a deal has been changed.  (Canada,  
Logistics,  or trader)

I don't think any of these requests is unreasonable.
