Hello!

As you know (all too well!), your job does not offer you all of the 
flexibility that you might like.  In an effort to give you a little more free 
time, we will start with the following plan.

What's a late day and who gets them?
Each book calc'er will sign up for a  one late day a month.  A late day is 
defined as a  one in which you do not come into the office until 3 p.m.   

When can I have one?
The late days to sign up for include any day Monday-Friday (excluding bid 
week thru 2nd workday).  Only one person can be out with a late day each 
day.  

Who's my back-up?
When you enjoy your late day, your back-up as defined below is responsible 
for your activities until 3 p.m.  If the following back-up schedule needs to 
change, let's make that quickly.  If you need additional security access to 
back-up someone, then put that request in immediately.  Each of the back-ups 
should "swap" jobs for a few days (until 3 p.m. to practice your 
responsibilities).  

If the back-up plan is successful, then we can potentially expand our 
creative work schedule possibilities.  We must prove that it will work, 
however, before can take any more steps.

When do we start?
All regions will implement in June. . .Irena will coordinate the calendar 
next week.

Let me know what you think!
Carrie
