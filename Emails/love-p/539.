Jim,

P. Love informed me that we should see a liquidation (QZ0764) in the Ontario 
Region intended to offset an Interdesk deal between IM Ontario and IM New 
England where we forced the purchase.  Looks like it was booked in TAGG 
between FT-Ontario and FT-NY.  

Can we find the liquidation and show in IM Ontario?

Thanks,
Greg
