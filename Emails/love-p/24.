The security desk, has changed TDS access approval from Bill Kasemervisz to 
each respective desk lead.  
The attached application should be saved on your C:drive and used to grant 
access to people that you want to have access to your desk.
The application is pretty self explanatory, however if you have any questions 
please give me a call.
