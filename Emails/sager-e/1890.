Elizabeth - I just wanted to remind you that I have another Ontario standard 
contract meeting tomorrow.  If you do have a chance to either send me an 
email or give me a call with some more info on why it is a physical market it 
would be greatly appreciated.  Attached is a short slide presentation that 
was made at the last meeting regarding how the market settles.

Thanks
CJG
