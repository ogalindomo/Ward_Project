As expected, Lil Anne cannot baby sit next Saturday.  She has a Christmas 
party that night.  I left Ted a message that we were both have problems 
getting a baby sitter and suggested that perhaps the 16th would work.

We didn't talk about the Nutcracker, but are you interested in going on the 
same night?  I think Eleanor might sit and behave better if an older, more 
calm friend went also...

Talk to you later.  Sheryl.
