Subject: California Exposure


Hello Steve,

Thank you for returning my call.  Attached are two spreadsheets representing 
the exposure we have with the PX and ISO.  There has been no change to the 
receivables due.  PGE did not engage in transactions beyond the expiration of 
the DOE order February 7th.

The only other exposure we have with PG&E is a payable in the amount of 
$704.318 with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corp for gas we purchased in March.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks...
