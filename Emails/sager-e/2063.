Phil's birthday is the 21st, so I was thinking that I might want to have a 
birthday type dinner for him this Saturday.  Some place relatively casual but 
good food (I obviously have put a lot of thought into this).  I was thinking 
about dinner around 7:30.  Are you and Grant interested in joining us?  Julie 
is babysitting for us.  I am going to see if she can come over around 3 so 
Phil and I can also finish our Christmas shopping.  S.
