Dear Mark and Elizabeth:

We wanted to send you both a quick note highlighting the tremendous efforts 
that Janice Moore has contributed to two recent opportunities, namely the 
RFPs for Maine and Western Mass Electric standard offer service.   Both of 
these opportunities involved significant legal and commercial landmines that 
Janice was a key contributor in identifying and mitigating.   Unfortunately, 
due to legal/commercial risks and other factors associated with the formal 
RFP processes, we were not able to respond with conforming proposals to 
either of these opportunities.  Therefore, we wanted to make sure Janice's 
significant contributions on both of these efforts were duly recognized, 
despite no commercial deal being struck.  Importantly, we anticipate that 
there will be continued opportunities to acquire some of the wholesale load 
in Maine under commercial and legal terms that are satisfactory to Enron, and 
given her familiarity with our work in Maine to date, Janice will surely be 
able to provide valuable legal support as we pursue those follow-on 
opportunities.

Regards,
John Llodra and George Wood
