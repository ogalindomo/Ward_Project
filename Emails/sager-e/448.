Please have an atty/paralegal forward a template of the 3 party book out / 
assignment agreement to Tractebel.  Laura Kenner is the credit contact and 
her email address is lkinner@tractebelusa.com.  We are potentially looking at 
assigning a few trades from AEP to Tractebel.  If anyone should need to 
contact Laura, she can be reached at (713) 350-1763.  They would like to see 
this by Tues if possible.  thks.
