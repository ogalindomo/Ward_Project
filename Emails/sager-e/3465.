Elizabeth: thanks very much.  Sorry to bother you with this stuff with 
everything you have going on, but unfortunately, as you recall from your law 
firm days, it is a necessary evil of outside legal practice.  I'm sure we 
will be speaking soon.  John

Hi John

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an
assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY
), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about
invoicing.
