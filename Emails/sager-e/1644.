As you are aware, some lawyers and legal specialists were recently moved into 
different groups within our department.  Time and expenses should continue to 
be charged through year end to the Cost Centers or WBS Elements which were 
already in place.  This is for budget purposes.

This means timekeepers need to continue to enter time as usual --- for the 
same people and groups you have been entering time for until we can charge 
time and expenses to the new Cost Centers at the beginning of 2001. 

In summary, your Cost Center will not change until January 2001.
