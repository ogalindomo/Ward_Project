We had a little Excel disaster this afternoon adding fields for ENA, so if 
it's okay I'd like to deliver the environmental documents first thing Tuesday 
morning.  Unfortunately, Stacey is gone for the afternoon on personal matters 
and I am leaving for a doctors appt as well otherwise we'd send them today.  
You will have the map and the RPS and Disclosure standards and the New 
England model rule first thing in the morning.
