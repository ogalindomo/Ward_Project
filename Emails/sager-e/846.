Sounds great - what do you think about 7-11 or 12 so the kids can "watch the 
sun set, too"

Willy and I were thinking we would get a sitter from 5pm-11pm on Saturday
night for Sam , Ella and Lucy. What do you think?? The agency charges a
$ 30.00 flat fee and then anywhere from $10- $15 an hour after that.
