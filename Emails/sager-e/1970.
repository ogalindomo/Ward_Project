We are contemplating taking a performance bond as collateral to secure our 
position with Duke.   I would like you to review the language of the 
performance bond from a legal perspective upon receipt.  My concerns are the 
claim process will be slow and will be subject to legal interpretation.  I 
would like to discuss with you the risks associated with this type of 
security.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,
My corporate insurance people are working diligently on a form of
performance bond that will be acceptable to the insurance companies.
The insurance companies involved, so far, are Fireman's Fund and Traveler's
(both rated S&P: "AAA" and AM Best: "A++").  I say "so far" because we
contemplate needing to have those two insurance companies "agent" a deal
that will involve more names.  As soon as I have those names, I will let
you know.

This matter is top priority in Charlotte.

Thanks,
Randy
