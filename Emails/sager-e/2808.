Per conversation with christian, and prior discussions with cadwalader i 
think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my 
first read.  i thought what we were after was if one leg is set aside in a 
bankruptcy then all legs are "set aside" this being different than 
defaulted.  Mary
