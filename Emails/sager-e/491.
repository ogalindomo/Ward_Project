Do these numbers include both EES and EEMC with respect to both PGE and SCE.  
If not I need them all combined.

Thanks for your help.

Per Mike's request, the attached note has our latest estimate on PX credits.  
We are expecting to have a final estimate by Friday.  Let me know if this 
timing works for you.  Thanks.

Our current estimate of PX credits thru Mid March is ~$570MM including the 
$269MM we transferred to EPMI in Dec.  I don't expect the rest of March to be 
large, but I'll get you an update asap.
