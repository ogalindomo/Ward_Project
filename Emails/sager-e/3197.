Subject: EnronOnline GTC's

Good News!  We finally received approval of the language to be used for 
EnronOnline transactions 
subject to General Terms & Conditions so that we do not have to attached the 
GTC's to every 
confirmation sent.  Again, the language attached is for particular products, 
so please check with your 
respective legal groups to get their approval.

I would like to start this process next Monday, April 30, 2001.  Can everyone 
meet that deadline?  If 
this does not affect you, please reply so.


Attached is the final language (don't let the file name fool you):
