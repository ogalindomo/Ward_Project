Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of 
these rules if needed.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa
