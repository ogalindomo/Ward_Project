Shari - 

It looks like Friday afternoon will be the only day i can do the meeting this 
week.  I will check with entergy and see if this works for them.  Before I 
call them, can you give me an updated list of issues we want to discuss and 
who we would like for them have in attendance.  Also, if any documents have 
changed hands since our last meeting that have changed any status, please let 
me know.

Thanks,
Rogers
