Under the direction of Mark Frevert, Public Relations has created a Weekly 
Electronic Newsletter giving employees the latest news in Enron Americas, 
Industrial Markets and Global Markets at the click of a button.  Our goal is 
to provide information about recent developments and events from the various 
business units straight from the source, YOU!  We need your cooperation and 
participation since EA/EGM/EIM readers want to know more about the Enron 
Americas.  Please help open the door for us by getting your direct reports on 
board and encouraging them to send us news.

Watch for a weekly reminder email, giving upcoming newsletter deadlines.  The 
deadline for the next newsletter is noon, Wednesday, December 13.    If you 
need assistance formatting your business highlights, Kathie Grabstald, the 
newsletter writer, will help turn your bullet points into paragraphs.

Sincerely,
Michelle Vitrella & Kathie Grabstald



I have been asked to pass on newletter items for ENA Legal to EnTouch.   It 
is a weekly newsletter with a Wednesday 12 noon deadline.  

If you have an item of interest to include please send me the pertinent 
information - a format like the monthly report may give Kathie enough to work 
with.
