To all:  I just talked to Kevin and we will use Enron-SE Corp. for this and 
not set up Enron-MW Corp. (Elizabeth,  we don't see a need to have a separate 
company, since all the confidentiality Ks, etc. are under Enron-SE Corp., but 
let me know if you disagree.  Thanks!)

Subject: Midwest Control Area Company

As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants 
as control areas in ECAR and MAIN, respectively, it is necessary to create a 
special purpose corporation.  As you may recall, we formed Enron-SE Corp. as 
the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp. 
would be the entity where the ECAR and MAIN control areas would reside.  
Please proceed immediately to create this new corporation.

Felicia,
In addition to ordering letterhead for Enron-SE Corp., please also order 
corporate letterhead for Enron-MW Corp.
