Attached is my preliminary mark-up of the draft sent by Mike Curry (5-2-01) 
incorporating the various following e-mails of Michelle to the best of my 
ability.  I ask that commercial persons rig up (or have someone else rig up 
for them) the "Attachment X" referenced in Michelle's new Section 2.9 
language.  Paul, I have reinstalled the Credit Support Annex in case you were 
intending to use that apparatus to install credit terms (and I'm presuming 
you are going to pull in an Enron Corp. guaranty, though I don't know your 
intentions.)  Please respond to me ASAP with your best efforts to state the 
final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

Michelle,

I do not see any problem whatever with this timeline.

Thanks.

David, Paul:

Do you think it will be possible to finish your mark-ups on the New Power 
Agreement by Wednesday?

Thanks,
