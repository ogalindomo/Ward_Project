ISO Market Participants:

This morning, the CA ISO circulated to Market Participants a subpoena it
received in the PG&E Bankrupcy proceeding (attached).  In accordance with
section 20.3 of the tariff, Market Participants must themselves take steps
to seek confidentiality protections to the extent they wish to do so.  In
the meantime, the CA ISO is preparing for timely production.  Market
Participants seeking confidentiality protections should coordinate with the
CA ISO's bankrupcy counsel David L. Neale who can be reached at 310-
