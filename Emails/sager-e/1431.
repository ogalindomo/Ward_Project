Subject: Re: Caledonia Letter To TVA  

I will probably sign the Agreement.

We need to send a letter to TVA appointing the Operating Representatives for 
the 4 Interconnection Agreements.   I recommend yourself and Lloyd Will be 
the Enron representatives for the respective Agreements.  I have a previous 
letter in the file (get from Felicia) that you can use a template to create 
the new letter appointing our Operating Reps.  In that letter, we should also 
include the new Enron Contact List (Plants Ops and Control Center Ops).
