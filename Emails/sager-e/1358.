Subject: Requests for Production-Calpine


Elizabeth, attached are the requests for production which I would like to
serve on Calpine by mail today. Richard suggested that I add a request
asking for all contracts which were not secured by a parent guarantee which
is a good idea. I am in the process of adding that. Please let me know if
you have any other suggestions. By copy of this e-mail I am also asking
David for any suggestions he has.  Thanks. Laura
