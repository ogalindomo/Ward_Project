Subject: TVA Q&A

Shelly Mansfield has drafted the attached Q&A and timeline in anticipation of 
our lawsuit against TVA regarding our control area.  Please review these 
materials and let me know if this is the approach we want to take if and when 
we receive inquiries.  Also attached is a standby statement if we receive 
inquiries about EPMI's letter to TVA about the MOPA.   We will probably want 
to revise this statement if the situation escalates.  

Thank you.
