I'm presuming you will have looked over the assembled materials and tables of

Martha,

If David's time permits on Monday or Tuesday, please have him look at what 
you have put together so far for the above.  I would really like to get this 
done or at least have one done prior to a new attorney joining the group on 
June 1.  Thanks for your help.

Genia
