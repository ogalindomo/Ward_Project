Thank you for you birthday call.  I appreciate your calls, even if we don't
get a chance to speak directly.

I was just wondering, do you have copies or negatives of the pictures that
were taken of us with Mom at Bob's house?  I think it was Thanksgiving.  I
would like to see them, maybe get some enlargements.  My friend Austin took
some, but I am afraid he may have lost them--I asked him recently in part
of an e-mail, and he did not answer the question.

Any plans for a visit when we could maybe get to the beach?
