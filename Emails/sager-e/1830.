Molly:

This has been on my calendar for 2;30 for quite a while, but a note sent 
earlier this week (while I was out sick) says it should be 2:00 -- is that 
right?  I'm afraid that I've set up a conference call w/ 4 other people for 
1:30 and it can't be changed at this point.  So I'm probably not going to be 
available at 2:00.  I don't want to appear rude to Alice, so could you let 
her know?  And I have no paperwork on her yet -- should I have a resume or 
something?  And you should also note that my location has changed. I'm now in 
EB3811.  

Thanks for your assistance.

Regards,
Janice
