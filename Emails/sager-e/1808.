Hey.

Hear that you didn't get to hit with Dan on Monday but instead got a few 
games of doubles under your belt.  How did that go?

I was wondering if you wanted to hit on Thursday either during lunch or after 
work.  I usually have a meeting during lunch on Thursday but heard it might 
be cancelled.  I am going to be up at the Met this evening and will book a 
court if you want to hit during either times.  I will just have to get back 
with you if you want to hit during lunch to let you know if we have our 
meeting or not.

Talk to you soon.
