Dear Elizabeth:

Thank you for accepting our invitation to speak at the Energy and Developing
Porducts conference in Houston on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons Hotel.


I will need to finalize the agenda by next week in order to begin promoting
the conference.  For marketing purposes, all I need at this stage is a
heading for your section followed by a few bullet points to describe the
contents of the discussion.

Also, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting speakers to
help you discuss topic.

I will be in the office all week and can be reached at 212-332-2559 or let
me know any suggestions you may have via email.

Again thanks and regards,
Liz
