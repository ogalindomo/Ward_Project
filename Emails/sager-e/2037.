For those newcomers (and a reminder to the old timers),  there is a 
departmental scanner is in cubicle no EB3884 which is adjacent from my 
cubicle.  It has a good OCR progam, OmniPage Pro 10, for text scanning.  
Please feel free to utilize the equipment and if you need assistance  feel 
free to contact me--I'm right next door.

Best regards,
