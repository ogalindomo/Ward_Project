Elizabeth,

My extension is x34881.   I will be in training next week.  After next week, 
we can arrange some drill sessions to burn off the holiday feast we will 
have.  My boyfriend, Bruce, mentioned that we should try to set up another 
fun game.  Let try it in December.  Nice seeing you today.  Have a nice 
thanksgiving.  Good luck on tonight's marathon match.
