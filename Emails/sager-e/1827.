Hey.

I am out all next week in Indianapolis and St. Louis.  I guess we will just 
have to check our schedules once I get back into town.

Have a good one!

Char

PS) Let's definitely get something together for doubles.... maybe you, me, 
Jennifer Stringer and ????

Hi Charlotte

I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week.  

PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a 
different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too

See you soon
