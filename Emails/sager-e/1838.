Thanks for everyone's help with the schedules. 

We believe we now have "execution ready" schedules.  If you would like to 
review your relevant section once more, please contact Stuart Zisman.  
Otherwise we will assume no request for review is an acknowledgement that the 
schedules are complete and include everything that you feel is relevant.  As 
you all know, we will be making "reps and warranties" as to the accuracy of 
the schedules, so it is important for everyone to feel comfortable that the 
schedules are all inclusive and exhaustive.

We will be providing the schedules by midday Friday to all the counterparties 
evaluating Caledonia and Brownsville.

Sorry to belabour this point; however, as you all know, the accuracy of the 
schedules are key in a transaction such as this.

Thanks again for your help and support throughout this process.

Regards,

Don
