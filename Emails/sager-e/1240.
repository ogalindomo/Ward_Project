Even though I've given you my new phone number, I thought it would be
helpful (my second name) to provide the new phone information to your
offices...there should be no excuses for not calling me...except that I
can't hear the new phone ringing unless I'm standing over it...which is
kinda like the old system...EXCEPT that I'm REALLY trying to check my
messages more often...as soon as I figure out how that is accomplished!!!

Soon I'll have a home e-mail address (as soon as Mr. Cox comes over and
installs the new home computer I have) which will be provided to all as soon
as it's available...

   new phone number is 832-236-5279

P.S.: this new phone is cellular...so theoretically, I can be reached any
place, any time...
