Elizabeth and Christian:

I just spoke with Steve and he can join us for a conference call tomorrow at 
1:00 pm PST to discuss contractual setoffs with WAPA.  Unless you hear 
otherwise, let's assume Christian and I will initiate the call.  I am also 
inviting Todd Barker to the call; Todd is a first-year associate at Stoel 
Rives who has been helping Steve and me with WAPA research.---sch
