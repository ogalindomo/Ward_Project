john, this is to confirm that you need to send these bills ( which should 
largely concern my world) to me now. we have a little backlog here that we 
are trying to organize and clear. i will keep vicki and elizabeth informed as 
necessary so i would not send ccs as think will just confuse people. vicki is 
sending over your last 2 bills i think and we will review and process thru 
here.
