I have been confirmed as the co-chair of the committee,  I have been 
confirmed as the co-chair of the committee.
They have agreed to use the Enron Canadian EEI as the starting point, they 
want me to put together a memo describing/explaining the key provisions.
They think a physical or hybrid (whatever that is) is the way to go, most

It is a beautiful day with white fluffy snow falling, it is probably around 
-10 celcius.


With respect to bullet number 2 above, do you have anything to give me so I 
don't have to do the work?  Didn't you and Mark prepare something?  Is Andy's 
paper a better starting place?
