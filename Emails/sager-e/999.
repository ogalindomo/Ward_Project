Ms. Sager:
I'm trying to find out more about Enron's memory  chip futures--specifically 
I'd like to see if I could publish a standard  contract for the instruments.? 
A search of Enron's website did not yield  anything (though probably I don't 
know how to search the site).? Neither  could I find any corporate site for 
Kenneth Wang, listed as director of your  Global Semiconductor Group.? Any 
help you could give me in this regard  would be appreciated.
?
Thanks,
