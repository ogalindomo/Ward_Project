I've received requests to convene a meeting of the Drafting Committee.  The 
purpose of the meeting would be to reach closure on the optional product 
definitions and other provisions (esp. the credit annex) that would be made 
available on the EEI website.  We should also discuss how to rectify the 
numerous typos that have been identified on the cover sheet and the GT&Cs.    
Would meeting sometime during late May or during June pose a problem?  I am 
also pretty much open during July and the first two weeks of August. I've 
attached a calendar w/ dates I'm not available.  If you could print the 
calendar; fill dates you are not available and fax to Patricia at 
202-508-5673 by COB Friday we can come up with a meeting date.  My first 
choice would be to have the meeting in D.C., but would be willing to go to 
another location.

FYI, John Varholy and I will be speaking at a conference on competitve 
electricity markets from 5/7-5/10 in Zagreb Croatia hosted by USAID.  I'll be 
talking about U.S. standard commodity contracts and John will be discuss EFET 
and Nordpool.  Also, I'll be speaking in Houston on May 15 at Energy & Power 
Risk Management 2001 on the EEI.  If you want to talk about the drafting 
commitee meeting I'll been in the office for the rest of the week and then 
out for two weeks.
