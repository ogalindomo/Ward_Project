Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl
