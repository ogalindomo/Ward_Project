Aha!  Craig Johnstone (rather than Greg Johnston), who is a rather 
ineffectual sort from a local firm Thackray Burgess and who used to do some 
Masters and confirms for us a few years back on a seconded (or more 
accurately an Enron funded sabbatical) basis in the Mary Lee Hopkins days. 
(Lavo knows him well.  In fact Lavo once instructed me to keep hiring lawyers 
until Craig Johnstone ceased showing up here.)  Our Greg is constantly 
getting confused with him, which I really quite enjoy.  Regards, Peter.
