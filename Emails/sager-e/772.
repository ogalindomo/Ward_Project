Thanks for your message.  I can meet with Jim Derrick on the 30th, and have 
flexibility to attend training on either the 29th or 31st.  One consideration 
is that Christian will be in St. Louis on the 31st and 1st; if Christian 
wants to attend the training session we should hold it on the 29th.

Enron will pay for my travel expenses, yes?

Best,

Steve
