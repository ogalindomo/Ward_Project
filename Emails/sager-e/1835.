Ed -- Following up  on our conversation yesterday, I have now had further 
negotiations with DP&L re the EEI cover sheet and all points are resolved, 
pending your credit worksheet and dispatch to DP&L of a cover shhet draft 
containing credit terms.  Please come back to me with credit input as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.  -- David
