Am following up on behalf of Andrzej Kabarowski regarding the
settlement agreement under discussion.

Would like to know if we can set up a conference call to wrap up any
outstanding issues on the proposed agreement. PowerEx and Cargill can
meet anytime between 2:00pm and 3:45pm CST today.

Please let me know if anytime in this period works for you as well.

thanks,

marc
