Enabling Agreement Committee:

    We recently received notification of our copyright on the Agreement.  We
also finally found someone to set up the document in a professional format.
The agreement is in PDF format and you may open it in adobe acrobat.  .  I
am forwarding a copy to you all for review first, before it is placed on the
ERCOT web site.  Please review it and comment on style or content.
Obviously, no substantive changes will be considered.   Also, please note my
new email address for future correspondence.
