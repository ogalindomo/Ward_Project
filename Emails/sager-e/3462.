Another day, another subpoena.  This one is from the CPUC's investigation and 
is directed to the CAISO.  Based on the requests in this subpoena, it looks 
as if the CPUC is not looking at the power marketers, but is focused on the 
in-state generators and the frequency, veracity and impact of their planned 
and forced outages.
