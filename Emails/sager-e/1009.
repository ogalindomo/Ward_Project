Hello,

I have signed up for the following training courses.   Except for June 12 
where I will be gone only 1 hour, I will plan to have a temporary at my 
desk.   If you have any projects this schedule may conflict with, please let 
me know and I will adjust accordingly.     

June 12 - 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. - Outlook Training
June 21 - 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. - XMS (Expense Reports)
June 22 - 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. - IBuyIt Procurement
June 27 - 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. - Timekeeping (SAP)
June 28 - 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. - IBuyIt Payables (Invoicing)

Thanks.   Al
