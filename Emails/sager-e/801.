I want to sign Eleanor (and maybe Alice too) up for swim lessons at the
Houstonian.  What is the name of the woman that you liked?

Also, I was looking at a day camp for Eleanor.  There are the "Kidventure"
camps that look pretty good.  They do one at the Houstonian (Kidventure
does), but it is full already for the 3-4 year olds.  Kidventure also holds
a camp at St. Anne's on Westheimer (it appears to not be religiously
affiliated, if that matters).  There are some slots still available for the
3-4 year olds and the 5-13 year olds if you were interested in Ella also.
I thought Eleanor would be more comfortable initially if she knew someone
since it would be a new place.  Are you interested in signing Sam (and
Ella, although they would not be together) up for a week in late July/early
August?  All this stuff is on the Houstonian web cite under the Youth link.

On another note, we enjoyed dinner on Saturday.  As always, the food and
company were great.  I think Phil drank way too much since he was quite
hungover on Sunday, but other than that, no casualties.  Eleanor slept in
until 8 a.m.  a first for her.  I need to get Julie to keep her up later,
although we were still up at 7 with Alice.
