Greg,
You're absolutely correct (obviously), and I actually noted that when I first 
started sending that chart out. I did that so that they would be more in 
scale and fit on the same chart. The chart is provided only to identify the 
trend of our performance relative to the NYMEX. Perhaps I should note each 
day that these volumes have been adjusted so as not to be misleading. Or, if 
you wish, I could stop adjusting the numbers and just chart the absolute 
values.
Please let me know which you would prefer.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

your volume comparison chart is off by a factor of 10.  each contract is 1000 
bbls.
