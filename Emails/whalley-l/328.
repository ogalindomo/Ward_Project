Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from 
4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received this, 
but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really fun 
activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit 
with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing 
with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for 
a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in 
your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of 
exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within 
the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and 
appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension 
x54070.

Thank you,
Billy
