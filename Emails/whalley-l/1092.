The following editorial was published on the Assembly Republican website 
today and probably offers a good preview of the 130pmPST press conference.

For those of you concerned with tracking generator stocks or following the 
Edison bankruptcy outlook, consider the following quote:
"Rather than make Edison and the power generating companies completely whole 
while the government takes over ownership of the "grid", lets instead make a 
clean deal. One can be fashioned that requires Edison and the power 
generators to take some write-offs so that the ratepayers do not bear the 
entire burden and the transmission lines remain in private hands."
