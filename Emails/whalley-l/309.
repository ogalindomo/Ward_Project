Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification 
obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member 
Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted 
purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 
million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially 
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were 
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the 
issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.
