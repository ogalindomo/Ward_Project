In planning one of the many fun activities for our upcoming holiday party, we 
thought a tarot card reader would be something that would be entertaining.
However, it has recently been brought to our attention that having a tarot 
reader would be offensive to some.  For those people, we would like to say 
that in the
planning of the holiday party there was never any intention of having a 
distasteful activity, but rather we were trying to be diverse in appealing to 
all the different
personalities of Net Works.

After a discussion and careful consideration, we have decided to cancel the 
tarot card reader.  We truly wish for everyone who attends to enjoy Net 
Work's first holiday party.

See you at the party!
