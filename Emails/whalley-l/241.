Jeff and Greg,

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,
Frank Levy
