Thank you for agreeing to meet with Janus on Wednesday, June 6, 2001.  The 
schedule is attached. 
As Jeff mentioned at yesterday's Executive Committee Meeting, he would like 
to get together at 3:00 p.m. 
(for 30 minutes) on Monday, June 5, to coordinate our message to Janus.  

Please let me know if you cannot attend.
