good news is that john endorsed me ideas for change on his last trip thru 
london.
don't know if you can sit in on a strategy meeting for oil group.  would be 
nice to have
you there because in terms of opportunities little has changed n past couple 
of years.
i'll give you an update when i know when i'm coming.
