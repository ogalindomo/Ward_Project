Philippe spotted this too today and has asked Steve Horn to pursue.   We may 
want to involve Robert in this from the employment perspective.

Good spot though.

Subject: IT Consulting Firms

I raised the issue of ENW considering the purchase of a tech consulting firm 
at a staff meeting several weeks ago.  Attached please find a quick and dirty 
analysis of some of the key players.  You may note that Luminant is trading 
below $1.  Please let me know if anyone is actively pursuing this 
"intellectual capital" opportunity.

All the best,

Tom
