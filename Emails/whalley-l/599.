I suppose by now you've each received the email turd that Anthony threw in 
your punchbowl this morning.  When you can, give me a call or email me with 
details on how you'd like to settle, (and the response I'm looking for is not 
"Never.")  If I don't talk to you today, have a nice "overseas" Thanksgiving.
