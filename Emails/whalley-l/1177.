On Thursday, May 31, Jeff Skilling is hosting a farewell dinner for Cliff 
Baxter at Brennan's.  You and your spouse/guest are invited.  Given the short 
timeframe under which we are working, I wanted to get it on your calendar 
sooner rather than later.  Formal invitations will be sent to your home 
within the next week.  SRS
