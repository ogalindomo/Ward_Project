The EES VaR for today is $8.2 million, up from yesterday's Var of $5.0 
million, due to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio at NP 
and SP.   The VaR will decrease once the short positions that were recently 
added to cover the University of California system deal are removed due to 
EES' successful appeal.
