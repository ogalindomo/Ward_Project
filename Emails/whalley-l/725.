Please remember about the panel discussion on Friday from 1:00 p.m. - 2:00 
p.m. at the LaSalle Room in the Doubletree Hotel - Allen Center.  This will 
provide a great opportunity for technologist candidates to learn more about 
Enron and the Global Technology Track within the Analyst program.  The attire 
is business casual.

THANKS!
