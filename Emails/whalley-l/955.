During the month of June, RAC will begin the rollout of our new website and=
=20
linked portfolio tracking system called PortRAC.  The website will provide=
=20
the user with instantly available transaction policies, procedures, DASH=01=
,s=20
and other valuable reports and links.  The PortRAC system is an extensive=
=20
database of merchant and strategic investment information combined with a=
=20
powerful search engine and report writer.  PortRAC will enable the analysis=
=20
of our investment portfolio in any fashion that the user specifies such as=
=20
the calculation of returns for a particular industry or region.

I believe that the new RAC website and PortRAC system will be valuable tool=
s=20
to help manage our business and I would like to provide you a personal =01&=
demo=018=20
before we introduce these applications to a broader population.

In the next two weeks, Rick Carson will be contacting you to arrange a=20
convenient time for the demo, which should take about 30 minutes.  I hope=
=20
that you will be able to make time in your schedule.

Please call me with any questions.
