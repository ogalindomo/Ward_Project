Post our exceptionally productive meeting today, I thought I would summarize 
where I thought we ended up, or where at least we should have ended up.

Jim is going to forward the specfication for Enfibre (only Enfibre) to 
Philippe.
Philippe will provide a team of people (from where is his choice) with no 
payments to be made to any other groups
Philippe will provide Jim with a price (the price will include a daily rate 
per person) for the specific project included in the scope and not the 
ongoing O&M etc
Jim then decides whether he wants to commence work with Net Works on this 
project or he adopts a different apporach.

Worst case with the above approach, Jim gets the EnFibre product up and 
running and the rest of his projects are dealt with as and when they come 
along.
