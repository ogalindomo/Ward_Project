Rich/Chad:

Check-out the following research piece from SSB on Dynergy, particularly the
section "Key Progress in Establishing Bandwidth Trading Platform".  My
question is this: SSB states the "Enron model" is built on pooling points
while Dynergy's strategy relies on "metro-hubs", which connect existing
points of presence in metropolitan areas.  Is this legit or BS, i.e. does
this analyst know what he talking about?

Thanks,

Peter
