What ?
We had $89m of value-at-risk concentrated primarily in Nymex short positions 
through July, August and September 01and we were $30m over our VaR limit for 
this commodity as at last night's close.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say this looks way out of bounds.
Has this been sanctioned ?

The gas desk made approx. 50MM today.  Additionally, it appears as if we got 
shorter approx. 20 - 30bcf this summer.
