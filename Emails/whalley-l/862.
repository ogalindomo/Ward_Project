Subject: Visit to Enron week of 3/19



Dear Mr.Fallon,
?
As we discussed, I think that several of your  corporate staff people will be 
interested in discussing our rapidly  
developing situation.?? Our President and I will be in Texas next  week, and 
I would like to firm up the visit with 
you on Thursday?morning.?  will contact your secretary to finalize the 
details on  Monday morning.

I am the Vice President of Research at Uhere  Corp in San Jose.? We are 
creating a comprehensive, regulated,  
clearinghouse-enabled web based futures exchange for a wide variety of B2B  
trading sites.? Our exchange will 
allow?Enronto  hedge and offset trading positions that?it?hastaken in power 
or bandwidth
and  could substantially increase?Enron'strading volume and liquidity.? We 
are looking for a trader/marketer  
like?Enron to partner with us in  the electricity and/or bandwidth markets.? 
The objective is to create 
a  new kind of financial entity for Risk Management.?? 
?
Currently, we are testing our trading  software.? We have a large, collocated 
IBM system here in San Jose.?  
Our regulatory attorneys are moving ahead rapidly with our CFTC application,  
and our clearinghouse is now 
coming into focus.? We expect to be able  to sell contracts within 8-10 
weeks. 
?
At this early stage, we are quite flexible in the  kinds of partnering 
arrangements that we will consider.??  
?
As I indicated to you, our Chairman is Mr. Bob  Greber formerly Chairman at 
the Pacific Exchange, and 
our regulatory  attorneys are Farella, Braun & Martel LLP. 
?
Would you be kind enough to inform others  with?Enron of?our visit ... others 
who might be interested  in?using our
situation  to  amplify Enron's?capabilities
?
Best regards,
?
Michael J. Cahill
