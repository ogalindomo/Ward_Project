Woodside just advised me that they are running behind schedule and will not 
be at Enron until 3:00.  The agenda will be as follows


3:00 - 3:30        Meet with Greg Whalley 

3:30 - 4:00        LNG Discussion with Les Webber and Kurt Lindahl

4:00 - 5:00 ECR Asset Discussion


Attendees from Woodside will be Agu Kanstler (Director of New Ventures), 
Chris Cronin (Director of Corporate Strategy), Trevor Wilson (General Manger 
- Woodside USA), Graham Jeffery (Business Analysis and Planning Manager) and 
Sam Langford (Consultant)

Meetings will be held in conference room EB3335 except for the meeting with 
Greg which will be determined.
I apologize for the inconvenience and the reschedule but it is out of my 
control.

Please call if there are any questions

Thanks,
Scott Josey
