Just FYI---we will NOT be mentioning Enron's name in the Allegheny Press 
Release that each of you have approved. Per Allegheny's request, we are 
deleting the sentence in the 1st paragraph which mentions that Las Vegas 
Cogeneration II is owned by Southwest Power, an affiliate of Enron North 
America. Everything else in the Press Release will stay the same.  

Allegheny asked that Enron NOT be included in the release, as they feel we 
have different approaches/philosophies in the marketplace, and they believe 
it may send a mixed message. However, there is not any sort of 
confidentiality agreement regarding the transaction, therefore we are 
certainly free to talk about it publicly. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I apologize for the multiple 
emails regarding this release--we just wanted everyone to be in the loop on 
all the changes. 

I have attached the FINAL Press Release for your files--this will be released 
by Allegheny on Friday morning, 5/11.

Thanks,
