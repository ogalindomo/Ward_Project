Last Tuesday Global Finance Europe closed  a new off balance sheet facility 
with Barclays creating up to $1bn of capacity for existing and new physical 
metals trades for Enron Metals.  This transaction will be added to through an 
additional $350mm of capacity from Credit Lyonnais and compliments the $750mm 
Warrants structure completed in September. 

Each transaction involves a sale of either Physical Metal or Warrants to the 
bank with Enron receiving an associated call option. The bank hedges its 
market risk through a  complimentary foward sale with the LME. The new 
physical metal facility will start receiving its first trades this week.     

The transaction achieves much for Enron: 
Deconsolidation of approximately $2bn of debt financed inventory which came 
with the aquisition of MG plc;
The creation of new capacity to grow the business beyond its existing base; 
Committed facilities for the business unit which are at a lower cost  than 
the original debt financed facilities;  
The creation of an additional  $2.15 bn capacity in the bank markets as the 
facilities extinguish up to 20 lines of existing credit in the banks market; 
A clearer reporting and control structure for the funding of Enron Metals.; 
A repeatable low cost structure which meets all tax and accounting tests for 
applications across all our business lines    

Congratulations to the deal team on this great effort
