Mr. Whalley

I am e-mailing you this memo after reading an article posted by Enron 
Internal Communications.

I live in Cloquet, Mn. and have been employed by Northern Natural Gas for 20+ 
years. The major employer in town is Potlatch Corp., a paper and pulp mill. 
The Potlatch Corporation has fallen on difficult financial times. There is 
rumor that Stora Enso of Finland is looking at buying the pulp mill. This 
mill has recently gone through a $1 Bil modernization. Included in the 
project is a steam/electric cogen facility. (not sure of capacity) In talking 
to the locals, the largest asset of Potlatch is their ownership of thousands 
of acres of forest land, that should insure raw material for the future.

I apologize if this has wasted your time, but thought that it was worth 
mentioning.

 Please call if there are any questions. 218.384.9208
