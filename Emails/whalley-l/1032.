Congratulations to you all on an exceptional effort in getting the Harrah's 
electricity deal closed! I know it was tough managing through the  internal 
issues- contract language, tariff/power pricing curve adjustments,etc- but it 
was the right thing to do and both the deal and Enron is much better off. 

Marty, Ken, Sean- Great job in keeping the customer at the table and still 
getting them to execution given all the changes in the last two weeks. 

Great job by all....congrats!
