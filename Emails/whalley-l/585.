Sure.  Confidentially, CSFB has the IPO.  Morgan Stanley is quietly handling 
some select acquisition inquiries.  I mentioned Enron and they didn't see why 
you'd want to look - so I offered to find out.  I think you'd be impressed by 
the CEO.

You can email me or call me at 310.201.4117.  I'm traveling Monday but always 
reachable.  Happy Turkey Day.
