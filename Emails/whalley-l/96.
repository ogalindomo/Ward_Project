I have received several calls this morning regarding the above, so apparently 
there is some doubt.  Please be advised that the executive committee will not 
meet today.  Further, due to travel schedules and the holidays, executive 
committee meetings will not be held on Monday, December 18 or Monday, 
December 25.  

Please make note that the next executive committee meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, January 2, 2001at 11:00 a.m. in EB50 Boardroom.

Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Regards and Happy Holidays!
