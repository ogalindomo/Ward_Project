Dear Greg,

Thank you for referring me to John Lavorato, who, in turn, referred me to 
Dave Duran and Chis Calger of East and West Power Originaton, respectively.  
I am speaking with Ben Jacoby, who works with Dave Duran, and I am optimistic 
of a potential match between Enron's needs and my career goals.

Best regards,
Manuel
