Due to the U. S. and London markets being closed Monday, May 28, 2001 in 
observance of Memorial Day in the United States and Spring Bank Holiday in 
London, the Consolidated DPR for Friday May 25 will be reported Tuesday May 
29.  Any trading activity that occurs in countries that do not observe a 
holiday on Monday, will be combined with Tuesday, May 29 trading activity, 
and reported on the Consolidated DPR on Wednesday, May 30. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Johnny Thibodeaux
