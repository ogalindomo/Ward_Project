We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)
