Liz - I'm not sure if Greg pulls his own cc:Mail?  If not please print off 
the attached and give to him.  JP Morgan research dated November 6th - has an 
excellent discussion of Enron Net Works and a new 12-month target price on 
the stock of $130.00 / share.  I ran in to him on the elevator and told him I 
would forward a copy of it.

Thnx,
