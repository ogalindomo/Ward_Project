Greg-

I interviewed this morning with for a logistics job with the bandwidth 
trading group, Paul Racicot's.

After my qualifications for the job were established, I mentioned to him that 
we were in the Army
together in Germany.  He asked me if you could attest for my performance at 
the time and I told
him "yes."  Although in a previous life, I sure hope you remember me and the 
great job I did 
maintaining L Troop's readiness, repair parts inventory, and maintenance 
records throughout all
all those border mission, gunneries, ARTEPs, etc.  As a reminder, L Troop 
always excelled on the
inspections and supplied repair parts to the other units.....Ben Bergfelt 
should definitely remember
how good I made him and L Troop look!

I apologize if I was out of line mentioning your name, only after my 
qualifications had been established,
but as CALME shuts down I am looking for a job.

I have attached my resume just in case you have a better job for me.

Regards,
Antonio
