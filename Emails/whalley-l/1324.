Hi Liz -

Thanks for copying me on this message.  Mike is in Venezuela and Jeff is on 
vacation.  They should both be back in the office on Monday.  Will you please 
relay this information to Greg.  Yesterday evening I called and left a 
voicemail for Mike relaying this message.

Thanks.

Greg is requesting Enron Global Markets' 2001 Goals & Objectives (no more
