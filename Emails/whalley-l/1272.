Hi Greg,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. As I mentioned I have a
BS/MS in EE from MIT and experience at JP Morgan in both equity
 and credit derivatives. I am currently a second year at Stanford Business
School and am interested in exploring opportunities at Enron in new
and innovative products in risk management. I have both a love for
understanding risk and am very entreprenurial by nature and like to create
new opportunities. Attached is a copy of my resume.

Thank you
