Hi guys, 

I'm looking for a purchase deal that the counterparty is showing, but we're 
not.  You guys were working that night. 
The criteria are as follows:

date:           1-23-01
HE 22         100 MW @ $390.00 
HE 23-24   125 MW @ $390.00

I have done a few searches and I find nothing.

Please let me know either way on this so I can close it out with Houston.
