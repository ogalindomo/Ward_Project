2,700 MW Off Grid Tue On Expired NOx Credits
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A spokeswoman for the California Independent System
Operator said Tuesday about 11,000 megawatts of power would be off the
state's power grid for much of December.
The ISO, which declared a stage one power emergency early Tuesday morning
after a stage two emergency Monday, is responsible for maintaining grid
reliability in the state.
About 2,700 MW were off line Tuesday due to expired nitrogen oxide emission
credits, spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.
"There is a tight market for air emission credits, just like there is a
tight market for natural gas right now," McCorkle said.
Of the 11,000 MW currently off line, 7,000 MW were off line for unplanned
maintenance. That figure includes those taken down for expired air emission
credits.
