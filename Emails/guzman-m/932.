Hey!  Sorry I didn't email you sooner.  Last week was a nightmare trying to
get things ready for the move.  But it went smoothly and I'm all settled.  I
need to get your little tv to you and pick up Christa's stereo.  Do you know
what your schedule is like this week?  What night would be good for me to
come by?  How was your weekend?  When are you going to LA next?
