Yes, you need to always do the deal entry on stuff like this.

Hey Cara,

I sold the 8 MW He 1-5 to WWP for $140. I bought MPC tranny  from Colstrip to 
Hot Springs for $4.66. I didn't know whether we do the deal entry or not. I 
have not done it this time but let me know whether to do ir or not in the 
future and under what group .

Monika
