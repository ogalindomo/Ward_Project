Good Morning,

The first cut of FSP2000 is almost ready for Trader feedback.  I will have 
the entire FSP2000 development team here in Portland over the next 2 weeks to 
wrap-up the coding & string testing as well as setup a prototype environment 
for you guys to test.  We definitely want your feedback to ensure the 
application will meet our needs for California scheduling.  Please reply back 
to this email when you would like to schedule a demo.  We should be ready for 
demo's by Thursday, November 30th.

Thanks,  David Poston

Here are a couple of highlights of FSP.
1.  Completely new look & feel.
2.  1 screen to create all schedules & bids.
3.  Automated Final Schedule variance allocation.
4.  Integration with Enpower.  No more double entry.  No Enpower to CAPS 
reconciliation.
5.  Integration with the Cal-Web.
6.  All new PMI screens with query capabilities.
7.  All new service deals.
8.  Ability save & reuse schedules & bids
