If you plan to attend the Brown Bag meeting on Wednesday, please stop by my 
desk to pick up four articles that you should read prior to the meeting.  The 
articles contain valuable information that explain the basic concepts of the 
energy shortage.  Tim will discuss the issues in more detail and will share 
his insights.

Please call or see me if you have any questions.
