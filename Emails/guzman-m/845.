Hi everyone....I sent this to some of you already, so delete it if you
already have the goods.  I bought a house and moved this last weekend.
Thanks to Bart, Brian, Lauren, Macey, and Vic.  Your hard work was much
appreciated.  For everyone else,
my new address is: 31369 SW Chia Loop, Wilsonville, OR 97070
New phone # is: 503-682-8061

Once I am settled, I will have a house warming shindig.  I hope you are all
doing well.

Oh and to those of you who went to the coast a couple weeks ago......I had a
great time.

Thanks, Elizah
