Glenn Anderson let me know that there is an updated version of the CARP 
report in EnPower Stage, and he wanted me to test it before putting it in 
production.   He would like to get it into production before month close 
comes up.  I know there are other users who should also test it, so that's 
why I am sending this note to all of you.  If you know of other users who 
should test it, as well, please forward this message to them.

After you have tested it, please send a note to Glenn letting him know 
whether or not you approve it.

Thanks,

Caroline
