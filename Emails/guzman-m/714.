Hello to all Pool Participants!

If you are interested in keeping track of the tournament and how you are 
doing compared to other people, you can click on this link to see:

http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~jfwells/ncaa/DEFAULT.HTM

This is an automatic output from the software that we are using to keep track 
of the entries this year.  Unfortunately, it does not show the Master 
Bracket, or Individual Brackets very well.  If I have time this weekend I 
will customize that feature.  You can see your score, the leader board, and 
find out how people picked individual teams to do.  I will update the site as 
groups of games are completed.

If a friend of your from outside of the company is playing in the pool, feel 
free to pass this along to them or send me their e-mail and I will include 
them in further messages.

The Assistant Commish,
Jason
