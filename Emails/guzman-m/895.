Congratulations to everyone who worked this weekend.  Beyond making a 
substantial amount of money, the variance in the calculated profit and loss 
and what we show in our incremental sheets was +$342.00.  Such a small 
variance comes from carefully tying out the SAR and the CARP, checking that 
both volumes and dollars match up exactly.  I appreciate the careful work of 
those on shift this weekend and Monday, and am impressed with this relatively 
small variance.  Keep up the good work!!!
