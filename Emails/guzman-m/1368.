Hey Guz what's up I was cleaning out my room and came across your biz card 
and thought that I'd give you a look see. What's new? Are you going to the 
Seafood and wine festival I hear all the kids are going this year. Not much 
happening on my end. Graduated from OSU and I'm currently looking for a job. 
I'm also living at Geoff's house so if you want to give me a call you can 
catch me at 503 293-9071. Lates. Ryan.
