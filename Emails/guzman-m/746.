Fraters,

My name is Ryan Hildebrand and I am from the Tau Chapter of Tau Kappa 
Epsilon. As the new Histor for our house, I have many plans.

Our house has had, in my opinion, a lack of relations with Alumni.  I feel 
that this is an important asset in the success of our chapter. Also, it is 
really
something to see fraters coming back together.  That is why my goal is to 
reestablish that connection.  After all TKE is for life!

Many ideas are in the works currently. I am in the process of locating lost 
Fraters, publishing an e-newsletter, starting a mentoring program, and 
thinking
about having some reunions before we watch the Beavers go for the National 
Championship.

I would like to extend an invitation for all alumni to check out our webpage:

Let me know what you think and I look forward to communicating with you this 
year.

Yours in the Bond,

Ryan Hildebrand
