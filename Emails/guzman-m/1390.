We sold 20 MW to UAMPS heavy load hours 1/5 - 1/31.  We are using a Glendale 
buy /resale from Mead 230kv to Mona to close the position.  The purchase from 
Glendale is contingent on transmission from IPP to Mona.  If both 345kv lines 
are derated, Glendale will be forced to reduce the delivery at Mona.  We sold 
the energy to UAMPS with the same contingency, so the delivery to UAMPS may 
be reduced as well if you are unable to economically resupply them. 

 Meanwhile, the delivery to Glendale at Mead will become a 'mutually agreed' 
delivery for the next scheduling hour.  If Glendale agrees to the price that 
you want for your power at Mead, the deal should continue to flow.  If they 
will not pay the market price you ask, Glendale may be reduced for the 
duration of the Mona-IPP deration.  When Mona-IPP is restored, the delivery 
to UAMPS is to resume for the next normally scheduled hour, and the Glendale 
buy/resale at Mead/Mona is to resume also.  If you have any questions feel 
free to call.
