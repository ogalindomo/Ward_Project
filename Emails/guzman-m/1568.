If you are interested in signing up for a flu shot, please call or email me 
by the end of the day on Thursday, December 7.  

I'm trying to arrange for the shots to be done at our 3 World Trade Center 
office, but we may have to go to the Enron Broadband building down the street 
to get them.  It is anticipated that the shots will be given in January.  

You will be notified of the date, place, and time the shots are scheduled to 
be given once that information is determined.  If you have any questions, 
please call me or see me.
