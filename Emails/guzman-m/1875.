This issue was resolved.   Enron did receive a call from PNM to increase 
their contingent to 50, however,   we did not call dispatch at EPE to inform 
them.

Kathy, 

This dispute of 28 vs 50 all day is not yet resolved.  I asked a few more 
questions and found out that the tapes were pulled for the wrong hours.  
Instead of 0300, they were listening to 1500.....  So, I have requested that 
the correct hours be pulled and we should have an answer tomorrow 
(hopefully!!).  Sorry that I could not fix it for good today.

Cheers
Jesse
