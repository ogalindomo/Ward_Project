Greetings everyone.  I just wanted to thank all of you for coming to the
housewarming party.  It meant a lot that so many of you came from far away
(Seattle and Grants Pass) for me, and helped me welcome in my new home.  I
also wanted to thank those of you were so kind and treated me to present.  I
didn't expect that, but fully loved it.  Thanks again for making it so much
fun.

Oh---I will probably be single by this weekend, so I am thinking we should
party on cinco de Mayo. I am giving Bart the boot. Let me know if something
fun is going on.  Talk to you all soon.

Luvins,
Elizah
