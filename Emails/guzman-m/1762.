Hello John,

Your request is complete and effective upon refresh of the EnPower System.

Samuel,
Mark also needs to be added to the following:

ST SW
ST NW
LT California

Real time traders need to make deal entries on behalf of all active West 
Desks (Power)   in order to properly bill defaulting counterparties due to 
schedule curtailments, etc.
This is the reason why such broad access is needed.


Thanks,

JMF
