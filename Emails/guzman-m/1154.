Dear Real-Timers,

Just wanted to let you know that I have had 4 or 5 dispute requests which are 
actually a counterparty change.  They have been entered in EnPower as sales 
or purchases to/from TransCanada Power Corp. when the counterparty is 
actually TransCanada Power, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd   (who 
really knows the difference?)  Anyway, just wanted to bring this to your 
attention so that the next time they call, you know how to record it in 
EnPower.  (Or at least you'll know to ask which TransCanada they are.)
