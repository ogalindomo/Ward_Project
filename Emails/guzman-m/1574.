The global ID field has been expanded to hold more data, and now you will be 
able to see who the network trans provider is and the sink.  Right now we are 
only doing this for NOB, but let me know how it goes.  I think too much more 
would be counter productive. Just click the "Global ID" part of the grey bar 
on the top of the report, and you will get the expanded view of this field.
