Fraters,

With the response for the spring football game being fairly well, we have 
decided on a BBQ. Cooking will begin at around 10am on that Saturday (April 
28th) and continue until we leave for the game at 1pm.

If I haven't heard from you yet, please reply. We might need to order more 
food depending on the numbers.

Don't miss out on this fun at the ole' Teke House!

*FYI*
This is the article from the first scrimmage last Friday:

Also, if you haven't ordered your season tickets for next season, you better 
hurry: http://osubeavers.fansonly.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/041701aaa.html

YITB,

Ryan
