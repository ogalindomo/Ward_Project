14:26 GMT 31 October 2000 DJ Calif ISO Board: Mgmt Can Sign Deals On New
Generators
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The governing board of the California Independent
System operator confirmed Monday night that the ISO's management is
authorized to pay for new generating capacity to be built in California.
An emergency board meeting was called to vote on the resolution, which said
that ISO staff "is authorized to enter into contract for approximately 2,000
MW of peaking capacity for a period of three years at a total cost for
capacity not to exceed $255 million per year."
The resolution passed 15-3, with four abstentions and one absence. It was
Monday's only vote.
The confirmation, on the eve of the ISO signing contracts for the new
generators, became necessary when the California Public Utilities Commission
and the California Electric Oversight Board told the ISO on Thursday that
they wanted to approve any such contracts before the ISO signed them. Some
of the supply, the PUC and EOB said, may be too expensive.
The ISO, in turn, asked the PUC and EOB to share any information they had on
less expensive new power supplies by noon Monday, but no such information
was submitted.
The new peaking capacity is to be on line in the state by June 1. The
contracts to build them are the result of a request for proposals issued in
August.
