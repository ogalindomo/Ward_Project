Guzman,

Willamette enpower deals were still entered in incorrectly for 12/20, and 
made it through the SAR that way.  I fixed them this morning. 

Concerning IPC, I cannot tell from your email if you spoke with IPC or what 
resolution you arrived at.  If EPMI is found to be responsible and you are 
unable to resolve the issue, you need to draft a letter to me with all the 
appropriate information concerning the trade.   I will then explain the 
discrepancy to EPE.  Please get me the complete information as quickly as 
possible.

Thank you,

Bill
