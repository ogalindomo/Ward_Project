I'm heading out of the office in the next fifteen minutes to drop of ballots. 
If you'd like me to drop one off for you, please let me know now!

Thanks,

Hello all...

I'm heading off to the Pioneer Courthouse today to drop of my ballot (and 
Teri's too) and thought that if anyone else had a ballot that needed to be 
submitted, I'd offer to take it in.

Let me know. I'll head out around lunch time (between 12/12:30pm).
