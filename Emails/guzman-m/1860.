All, 

I will have the finalized resource ID list from the PX next week.  If a 
schedule ID is used for a new customer, it's important to notify Vol Mgt ASAP 
so we can change the database to correctly account for the charges BEFORE WE 
RUN THE FLASH AND GIVE P/L NUMBERS TO RISK.  The list will let you  know 
which IDs can be used for new customers.  October was a pain to close, mostly 
because of this issue.  This should be a non-issue starting November. 

Thanks,

Brett
