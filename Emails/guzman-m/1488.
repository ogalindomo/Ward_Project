I have been informed by Scott Shishido that around 8:30 our time we will be 
moving over to the DS3 tunnel. He doesn't expect anyone to be booted from 
Terminal Server but just in case everyone needs to have everything saved. 
Scott will call real time just before the transfer takes place. If anyone has 
any questions they can call me at 503-969-7635. Thanks,  Chip Cox
