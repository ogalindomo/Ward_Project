Group,

If any schedules are cut that are EPE generation, we need to handle it in a 
specific way.  Our first attempt should always be to make the downstream 
marketer sell the energy at PV (or wherever the cut is) just like we would on 
any Enron schedule.  Be forceful and do not simply agree to back down 
generation.  It was a firm sale and it is their power.  However, if they 
cannot find a home for the power, or are unwilling to, tell them you will be 
forced to sell it for them and let them know that they would most likely get 
a higher price than you would, as they have more interest in that price.  If 
all else fails, you may book out the schedules by backing down EPE gen.  If 
you do this, the price you buy the energy back at must be lower than the 
generation cost.  EPE is never pleased when we buy back a firm schedule for a 
price higher than the gen cost.  If you do bookout a schedule, show it as a 
purchase in the EPE model with a comment as to what it is.  If you have any 
questions about the cuts or correct enpower procedure, ask Bill or myself.  

Thanks
