I would love to go.  I have to see which one it is.  BESIDES, it will
obviously be the Rose Bowl if the Huskies will just cooperate.

I will be in San Jose next week if you want to come visit.  I will actually
be hanging out in PDX or Corvallis the weekend of Dec 9.  I will probably be
found somewhere around the Mr. and Mrs. Jones residence.  Have a cold one
ready for me!
