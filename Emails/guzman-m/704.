We have length for Saturday and Sunday at Mead.  We can take this into SP-15 
or look to sell it at PV or 4C.  PSCO has been buying, as have PAC, APS, and 
PNM, POWX etc...Daily's traded up near $195 for Sun and Mon.  Be careful with 
transmission and deal entry (APS website requires Microsoft Explorer not 
Netscape) and maximize this reasonably priced energy.
