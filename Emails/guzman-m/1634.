its at pioneer courthouse square.  yes, its pretty cool, a little on the 
cramped side though.  i am not on any secret beer newsletter, its called the 
a&e and it comes with the Friday newspaper.  you only hear about this shit 
from me because i care about my friends and i try to get people together - " 
i am a uniter, not a divider"

Where is the Holiday ale fest?  Is it cool? Are you on some sort of secret
beer newsletter that I am not getting?  How come I only hear about this
shit from you?  I feel out of touch with the world of brewdom
