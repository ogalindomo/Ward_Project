The World Trade Center Facilities Superintendent has informed us that PGE 
Underground has a main transformer with a bad network protector and is off 
line.  Power needs to be off to replace this network protector.  While this 
situation is inconvenient, it is an excellent opportuity to put our power 
backup systems to a test under optimimal circumstances, e.g., on a Sunday.  
Listed below is information about the outage.  Please review since it may 
require some action on your part.

PGE must turn off its main power supply to the building from 6 - 7 a.m. and 
then again from 3 - 4 p.m.
The building has a backup generator that will kick in five minutes after the 
main power supply shuts off.
Enron has a UPS that will provide us with five minutes worth of power.
If everything goes well, there should be no impact.
If there are problems with the backup generator or UPS, we could experience a 
power outage.
We should not experience a loss of phone service even in the unlikely event 
of a power outage.
It would be prudent to take precautions if you have any systems that may be 
impacted by a power outage.  You may want to log off your computer and turn 
it off on Friday before you leave the office.

Someone from our local IT group will be here on Sunday in case any problems 
arise.  Please contact Dave Steiner if you have any questions or concerns.
