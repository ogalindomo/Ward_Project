Greetings NB&S Pool Participants!

Just a reminder that you can check the latest standings at:

http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~jfwells/ncaa/DEFAULT.HTM

All of the links work, but the graphics of the score sheets are only visible 
in Netscape and pretty blurry there.  Not worth looking at.  If you need a 
copy of your sheet, let me know and I will get you one.
