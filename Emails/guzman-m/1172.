Subject: OASIS Version 1.4 Cutover

Just to make sure you are all aware, there is going to be an OASIS outage 
coming up at the end of the month.  As I understand it, all S&CP compliant 
OASIS nodes will be offline from 12 noon Wednesday, Feb 28th, to midnight of 
Feb 28/March 1 (12 hours).  All the above will be local time, so expect 
Eastern Time nodes to be out one hour earlier, Mountain Time nodes to be out 
one hour later, and Pacific Time nodes to be out 2 hours later.

The outage is to upgrade OASIS from version 1.3 to 1.4.  This will mostly be 
affecting the computer-to-computer template methods used by programs that 
interact with OASIS.  Standard web interfaces should only be effected in 
minor ways, if at all.

The plan is that all transactions will be taken by phone or fax during this 
time, and posted on the OASIS as soon as they are back up and time permits.  
I would suggest that the following actions be taken:

1.) Forward this message to Enron employee that buys or sells transmission or 
ancillary services on the OASIS.

2.) Forward this message to any developers that have written custom tools to 
interact with OASIS nodes.  Remember, developers don't always know what is 
going on in the industry.

3.) Begin mentioning this to Transmission Providers NOW to make sure they are 
aware of this change and understand that they WILL have to work with fax and 
verbal reservations.  Try to contact everyone you do business with and get 
their commitments to address this before it develops into something nasty.

4.) Be prepared to deal with this on February 28th.  If you have time, see if 
you can do some test scenarios with our more important TPs, to make sure we 
understand what information they are going to want for their processes.  Will 
they have a special fax form to fill out?  Will they accept only verbal 
requests?  

Hopefully, this will be a smooth transition.  However, we need to be prepared 
in case it is not.

This will impact all 1.3 S&CP Compliant OASIS nodes.  I'm not sure who those 
are, but I believe it will impact the following nodes:

MAPP OASIS
SPP OASIS (Holding a Workshop for 1.4 on February 16th)
NEPOOL OASIS (test node: http://nepooldev.jtsin.com/OASIS)
AEP OASIS
ECAR OASIS
MAIN OASIS
VACAR OASIS
Southern OASIS (test site: http://test.weboasis.com/)
Florida OASIS (FLOASIS) (test site: http://oasis.siemens-psc.com/)
Idaho Power OASIS
Northwest OASIS
Pacificorp OASIS
Rocky Mountain Area OASIS (RMAO)
Southwest OASIS (test site: http://www3.swoasis.com/OASIS/SRP/data2 login = 
studentx Password = tx)
Western OASIS
PJM OASIS (test site: http://oasisstaging.pjm.com )

It may also impact other nodes I am not aware of.  Many of these will have 
test sites up soon, so watch the OASIS for notices regarding them.
