Subject: Wheelabrator Schedule - 11/05 through 11/07/00




Here is our schedule for Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.  I have scheduled zero
MWh's for the PX day-ahead market because we are still day-to-day on our fuel
supply.  I will call the real-time scheduling desk to sell (probably 10 MW)
day-of or day-ahead.  If you need to reach me this weekend, please call my 
cell
# (209) 765-3587.

Thanks
