Greeting gentlemen,

Last time I wrote the Beavers were 6-1 and looking great. Now we  are 8-1 for 
the first time ever and?Rose bowl contenders! GO Beavers!!! I was also  
looking for you to support the Teke house and trying to revive a little 
Alumni  presence at the house. I got a good deal of response and at 
Homecoming there  were many of us who stopped by the house. The current 
members were very  impressed and I was told by lots of the guys that really 
enjoyed hearing our  stories and memories. We can have animpact on the men 
currently in the house and  help give a positive direction for them to 
follow. One aspect that is on top of  my list to promote in the house is 
brotherhood. Through brotherhood they can  support one another in the real 
reason they are there: Education. With a strong  brotherhood they will use 
each other more for help and guidance, instead of  roommates. I have begun to 
raise money for a new TV in the basement, which they  can gather around, 
bond, and just spend more time with one another. The amount  of money that I 
have raised is still a bit short of the goal to present it  before the Civil 
War game. We need your support! It is not necessary to give a  large amount 
if you are unable, any amount helps toward the goal. We are greatly  thankful 
for  any help you can give. I also would like suggestions for Alumni  
functions. I feel that many of us would like to renew the brotherhood and 
start  to be a presence again as Alumni of Tau chapter. Thanks you guys and 
cheer for  for the Beavers this weekend.

YITB,
