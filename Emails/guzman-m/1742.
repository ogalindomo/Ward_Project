Now Idaho is going to deliver to us at John Day.  This is per Chris at IPC.
We are not using our Gray's Harbor or Franklin County Transmission on these 
paths. This was called into Marty@PRM.

I have recorded them on Donald's sheet in the 
P:Scheduling/November/MidC_Nov_inPdrive, and also as "cuts" in the lotus 
dbase.

Please still call everyone real time to confirm.  All LLH on 11/14. Be 
prepared for confusion as this path has changed numerous times.

The real path is  
 IPC@SYS-IPC(T)SYS/JD-EPMI-PGE(T) JD/MALIN O#GF 
F-EPMI-PWX-ISO(T)MALIN/NP15-PWX-PWXSC@NP15.

Mid C LLH,   we have 2 schedules  that are going real time due to 
curtailments at Lagrande

10 MW all LLH,  IPC@ AMPS-EPMI-FCPD(T)BPA(T)HOTSPRINGS/JD O# 
10043-EPMI-PGE(T)JD/MALIN O#GF-EPMI-PWX-PWXSC@NP15

15 MW all LLH,  IPC@ AMPS-EPMI-GHPD(T)BPA(T)HOTSPRINGS/JD O# 
96083-EPMI-PGE(T)JD/MALIN O#GF-EPMI-PWX-PWXSC@NP15


 IPC knows, PGE trans knows,  PRM said they would call it in to BPA, and PWX 
is going to call it in to CISO

Please keep an eye on this and double check with BPA and PGE tranny to 
confirm when the time comes.

Thanks,

Cara
