No problem - That's what friends are for.  I'm sorry you are so tired!
I'm wide awake and ansy to hear from Danny to see what kind of an offer he
can make me!!!  I want to move away now!  I'm curious to see how old Dave is
going to handle it when I tell him.

greatly appreciated.  I am so tired. I didn't get to bed until 1am last
