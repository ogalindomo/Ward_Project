Dear Group,

Beginning Monday October 30, EPE Marketing would like to take over the phones 
half an hour later and give the phones back to us half an hour later.  That 
would mean that they take the phones over at 6:30 PST and return them to us 
at 14:30 PST.  EPE Marketing believes that this time change will allow them 
to be better prepared when they begin trading, and will provide better flow 
when we hand over the phone.  If you have questions or comments concerning 
the future of this change, please voice them.

Bill
