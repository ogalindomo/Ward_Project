The hourly sheet will be going live tomorrow on the flat screens.  It will 
display bid/offer at the selected points.  The sheet will update on the flat  
screens when you save it and press the blue arrow (upload arrow in the upper 
left corner of the sheet).  Please update this sheet at least hourly and when 
you hear new bids or offers in the hour that might be of interest to others 
on the floor. 
See me with questions.
Bill
