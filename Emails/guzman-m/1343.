Good Morning/Evening,

If you find that SP, NP or ZP is out  in RT Position Manager on the weekend, 
please send out a short e-mail to the STCA desk.  Sometimes the person on 
shift may be unaware of the cause of the imbalance and it can be rectified by 
the following individual or it may happen in the evening when no one is 
present at the desk.

Thank you.
