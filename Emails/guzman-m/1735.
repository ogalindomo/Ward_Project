Morning Steven,

Will you please add four new resource IDs to the PX database for EPMI?  They 
are:
EPMIRTNP15IN
EPMIRTNP15OUT
EPMIRTSP15IN
EPMIRTSP15OUT

Please inform me of the Global IDs that will be assigned to these resources.  
As always, don't hesitate to call/email with questions.  503.464.8298.  
Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Brett
