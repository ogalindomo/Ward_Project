Good morning
Ok, a few items today.  Sorry to those that showed up Saturday for practice 
and I wasnt there.  At 12:30 it was absolutely dumping rain at my house and I 
just assumed that the field was unplayable and that no one else would want to 
be out there anyways.  So to those brave souls that showed up, I give you my 
appreciation for your effort and again I apologize for either not calling or 
showing up myself.  Along those lines, tomorrows game has a chance of being 
rained out.  The rainout hotline number to call is 503-823-2233, it is 
updated after 3 PM.  Lastly, I have also made some aerial maps of the parks 
that we play at this spring.  I guess you could say that I have too much time 
on my hands, but I have access to some cool programs here at work.  So 
hopefully these will help you guys find the parks.  See you guys tomorrow, 
weather permitting.  Questions, comments, let me know.
Chris
