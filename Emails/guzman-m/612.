In my haste to schedule practices, I didnt realize that I had scheduled one 
on Easter Sunday.  So, what I need to know is who is going to make it and who 
cant.  That means that you will have to use the "Reply" function and give me 
a simple "yes" or "no".  If you cant make it, dont worry, we still have two 
more practices scheduled - Sunday April 22nd at 1 PM and Saturday April 28th 
at 1 PM.  All are at Westmoreland Park #2.  Westmoreland Park is on SE 22nd 
and Bybee.  If you need directions let me know.  Call me at 503-296-0782 if 
you have any questions or comments.  See ya.
