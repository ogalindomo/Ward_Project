They are great, they actually play every tuesday and thursday at Jimmy 
Mak's.  I would love to go and I will try to drum up some support for it 
here.  We should probably get there before 9pm to secure good seats even 
though they start jamming around 9:30-45.

This Thursday The Mel Brown Sextet is playing at Jimmy Mak's.  I have no idea 
if they are any good, but it may be fun.  Want to get a group together and 
check it out?
