Dear Mark,

Can you look at deal # 460097, sale of 45 or 50 (??) MW to Texas-New Mexico 
on 11/16/00 at HE7 for $125.00. 
EnPower, the El Paso Model, and Unit Status all say that this deal was at 50 
MWh's, HOWEVER, you have put a note in the El Paso Model that states that El 
Paso is claiming that it's only 45 MW (no other comments).  I have a dispute 
here from El Paso who, on the back end, is saying that the deal was only for 
45MWs.  I'm assuming that the deal was actually 50MWs and that's why you left 
our systems at 50MW and just made a note.  Please advise me on what I need to 
tell Houston Settlements so we can get paid on this.

Thanks,
