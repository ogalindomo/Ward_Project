Group,
Recently we have had problems with the Scheduling Activity Report.  In 
speaking with Will Smith, it is important that we include the appropriate 
date, the correct regions, the ST-Whourly desk, and the correct group (24 
inc).  Without an entry in the desk field, this report is guaranteed to take 
25-30 minutes to run!  Obviously not all deals will pull in (deals under 
ST-Cali, ST-Bom, or ST-Services) when our desk is specified.  It is STILL the 
responsibility of the trader running the report to "tie out" the total dollar 
amount (not mw) to the inc and service sheets, exactly.  A detailed 
explanantion of a deviation in this dollar amount is expected (ie. extra 
revenue is a result of congestion, or extra revenue is a result of purchases 
from imbalance at zero...etc.).  If you have any questions on this report or 
any other daily task.  Please let me know. 

Thank you,
B Williams
