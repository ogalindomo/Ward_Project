good morning
its now official, i registered the team yesterday, and yes we are the Loan 
Sharks again, so keep those jerseys.  however, i still need money from those 
that havent paid yet.  games will start in may and i will get a schedule in 
late April.  what i would like is some feedback on practices.  i wont subject 
you to another survey, but i do want to know if you guys would prefer a 
weekday or weekend practice.  i think sundays work best but if you guys want 
to do an after work thing then let me know.  otherwise sundays it will be.  
and last but not least, i will be going up to the batting cages at least once 
a week and i hope to see most of you up there too.  take it easy.
