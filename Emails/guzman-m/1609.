We finally know!

Two weeks after OSU's final regular season game and more than
a month after becoming bowl eligible, we finally know where
the Beavers will be playing - and we are thrilled! The Beavers
will meet the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame in the 30th Annual
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona on January 1, 2001.
This BCS Bowl selection is a great honor for OSU and it's time
to show the country how well Beavers Believers support our team!

The OSU Alumni Association staff has already begun finalizing
arrangements for pep-rallies, tailgaters, and other activities
open to all Beaver alumni, friends and fans. Details will be
published as they become available. All OSU Alumni Association
events will be included in the price of the Official Bowl Tour.

More great news from the Athletic Department!
Coach Dennis Erickson signed a new seven-year guaranteed
contract Saturday that has potential for him to earn nearly
seven million dollars over the length of the contract.
