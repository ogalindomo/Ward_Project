We have instances where NEVP transmission is purchased daily,  but not used,  
ie LV's unit goes down etc.      
From  now on,   leave the mw's in Enpower on the transmission deal, even 
though nothing flowed.      Please leave the mw's populated in the 
transmission deal, as this transmission is take or pay.   Make a note in the 
comments that we didnt flow for this hour.
