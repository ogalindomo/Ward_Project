The In-Focus Projector has been set up as a "Resource" in the Portland 
Conference Room Calendar.  Because of the high demand for use of the In-Focus 
Projector, it is important that you reserve it on the calendar in advance.

Reservation of the In-Focus machine will be for the projector only.  If you 
need a laptop as well, contact IT.  To ensure it is available when needed, 
please have your assistant reserve it in advance.

Thanks for your cooperation with this new procedure.
