> The Beavers are 9 and 1 and this year's Civil War has huge bowl game

> summer.

> If you aren't going to be able to be in the stands, but still want to be
> around fellow Beaver Believers while you watch the game on TV, the Oregon
> State University Alumni Association has arranged for several official
> televised locations around the country. The details can be found here:

> As far as the bowl game goes, we know two things:
> The Beavers will be in a bowl game.
> That bowl game will not be in Hawaii.
> As more information becomes available, the Alumni Association staff wants
> to be able to distribute the information as quickly as possible to anyone
> who is interested. To that end, we have developed a web site and an email
> update system that will allow us to keep everyone up-to-date. You can sign
