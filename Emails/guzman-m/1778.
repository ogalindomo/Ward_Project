Attached is a complete list of resources and scheduling IDs registered with 
the PX.  This shows the customer to whom charges/payments are assessed when 
you use a particular scheduling ID.  Use this list to help you determine 
which ID to use when scheduling for a new customer for the first time.  If 
I'm in the office, please discuss with me prior to actually sending in the 
schedule to the PX.  Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated as it 
will save time and prevent headaches for me each month.
