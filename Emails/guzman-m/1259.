Greetings
Yes, it is that time of year again.  Time to start thinking about another 
championship season.  This is going to be real preliminary, what I need to 
know is who is interested in playing, then we can get into the gory details.  
Here though is a basic schedule - Register in mid-February.  Season starts in 
May and we will play 5 games in 5 weeks.  Then there is a two week break to 
make up games.  2nd half starts in July and again 5 games in 5 weeks.  The 
cost is going to be around $50-70 depending on things.  Games will be once a 
week starting anytime between 6:30 and 9:30 or something like that.  So, let 
me know if you want to play or not.
Chris
