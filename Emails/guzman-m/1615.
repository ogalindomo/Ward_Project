I am sure that you have seen my announcement  regarding my departure 
effective with the new year.
Thanks for the dedication and sacrifice that was necessary for our success 
this year.    The new year will bring about change and new difficult 
challenges, but CHANGE IS GOOD.  

I am sure that you are wondering about the organization of the group in the 
new year.      I have been planning  a reorganization, regardless of my move.
The reorg and the naming of my replacement  will be announced possibly next 
week.         Management has not given final approval for these changes.

This group will continue to be a success in the new year - another reason it 
is hard to leave!       I encourage each of you to stay aggressive and learn 
something new every day.       

KEEP THE MACHINE RUNNING!!!!

Thanks,
