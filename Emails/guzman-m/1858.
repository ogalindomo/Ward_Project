I for one believed the judging to be objective and fair. Clearly, "price 
caps" are out of favor. Enron's totally impartial judges, and FERC's 
independent analysis, reached  the same (appropriate) conclusion.  As for 
fatigues, they are difficult to see, so how can one expect to be evaluated 
on  a costume that is visually disadvantaged. 

The foundation of  Enron's business is competition. Obviously, the 
exceptional wisdom of the independent judges recognized that cycling is a 
highly competitive activity. Therefor, a cycling costume reflected the spirit 
of Enron and the Halloween competition. 

 My suggestion to Mr. Rasmussen for next years competition is that he wear 
lycra camouflage.
