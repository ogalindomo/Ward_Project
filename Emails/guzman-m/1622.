All,

I told Mike Tully that I was here last nite when RT couldn't run the report, 
but I could from my desk.  I explained to him the problems your group has 
been having with this report.  I'm going to see if the RT guys (Monica and 
Collin) can run a report today (per Mike's suggestion - to see if it's 
possibly a day/nite thing).   I told Mike we'll monitor this prob for a while 
to see if it gets better or worse.  In the interim, it's important to send an 
email to Dave Poston and Mike Tully (and copy me)everytime you have trouble 
running or printing the report.   Please be as specific as possible in your 
emails.  It sounds like it may be hard to pinpoint the cause of these 
problems, so I want to start accumulating as much documentation as possible 
for support.

There were some problems with the server last night (r: drive).  Can you 
rerun the report and see if it works now?  The report is pulling Oracle data 
from Enpower which works fine but it seems to have an issue finding the 
caps.mdb.  It must be an infrastructure problem.

Thanks, Poston

The Enpower to PX Report is not pulling in the Caps deals.  The enpower part 
is fine but there is nothing for caps. We obviously have a huge variance when 
this occurs.......  Do you have any idea what might be causing this error?

Cheers
