In caps you can see that there is is length under sce1 under ECTSTCA2 and 
EES2.
EES2 is shaped.  On Saturday(03/17), we have an 51 and 58 mws in EES2 for HE 
14 and 15 respectively.  47 and 54 mws of this length in EES2 (HE 14 and HE 
15) is from Riverside and is actually ST-CALI's length.  We are profit 
sharing the 47 and 54 mws with ST-CALI, 50/50 above $150.  Buy under ST-CALI 
from imbalance and sell under ST-CALI to another SC(or whomever).  Then make 
an annuity to ST-Whourly from ST Cali.

ALSO...ECTSTCA2 is 50 mws long all day on 3/18, and 50 mws long light load 
for3/19 in SCE1.
We are doing the standard profit share with ST-CALI(50/50 as above) at a 
basis price of $175. 
If you have any questions, please call me (503) 887-3449.

Thanks,
Bill
