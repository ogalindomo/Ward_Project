As you know, the United Way Campaign is underway in our Portland office.  
Thanks to all of you who have already contributed to the campaign.  For those 
of you who intend to contribute but have not had a chance to complete the 
contribution process, please contact me if you have questions, need 
additional information, or need help in completing your pledge.

Participation in other internal groups is much higher than ours, so I wanted 
to send this friendly reminder to make sure you have a resource to get any 
questions answered.
