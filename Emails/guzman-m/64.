Hey Guz,

I am going to be in LA May 26-29th.  I know you are down there frequently,
so if you happen to be going that weekend- Eric Brooker rented a beach house
for the week to celebrate graduating from optometry school.  He is throwing
a party on the 26th.  I'll get more info for you if you are going to be down
that weekend.
Take it easy,
Ben
