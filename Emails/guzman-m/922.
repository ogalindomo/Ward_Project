I left a packet of information in each of your mail slots containing 3 sheets 
of information.  This is information that I managed to find off the WSCC 
website containing potentially useful tidbits on the physical side of 
things.  The first sheets (the one with color) contains information on Joint 
Owned Units (JOU's) and some examples of how to tag specific ones.  The 
second sheet contains a few more examples of JOU's.  The third sheet (called 
WSCC Scheduler's Course) contains information on specific interties and what 
control areas have an interst, as well as some useful notes about the 
specific tie.  If you have any question, let me know.

Cheers
Jesse
