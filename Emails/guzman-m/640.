Group,
Just a quick reminder.  We have a meeting April 11 at 4:30 in the afternoon.  
We will review ytd performance of the group, areas where we are doing well, 
and areas for improviement.  Please bring your thoughts and material to take 
notes.  We will also have a couple Hot Lips Pizzas again. 
 
Additionally, I have not heard from all of you regarding the class on April 
27th and 28th. 
The course is Electric System Operation for the Non-engineer.  The course 
highlights include:
Generation
Transmission and Overhead
Distribution Systems
Underground Distribution
Switchgear
Voltage Control
Matching Generation

The course will purportedly provide a comprehensive understanding of system 
operations including fossil fuel, hydro and nuclear generation, transmission 
and distribution.  The course should provide not only technical information 
but also economics of operation, system and equipment protection and safety.

If I have not heard from you by Noon on the 11th, I will assume that you are 
not interested.
Thanks,

Bill
