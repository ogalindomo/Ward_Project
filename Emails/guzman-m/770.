There is a new feature in OATI that you all may find helpful.  The feature 
enables the user to view only real-time tags (that would be tags without the 
prescheduled flag checked).  This can be accomplished by clicking on the MORE 
FILTERS button next to the REFRESH button.  This will open an Optional 
Filters screen.  In order to view only the RT tags, choose WSCC pre-sched 
option as not pre-sched and choose OK.  Remember that you have this option on 
when you are searching for pre-scheduled tags!!

Cheers
