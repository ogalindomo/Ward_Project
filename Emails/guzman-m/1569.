Hey Guz, just trying to touch base before you leave. What time are you
flying in tomorrow am or pm?  Let me know so I can figure out what time to
come out to meet you and Burns.  I get off at 4:30 on Wednesday so i was
thinking that I would just cruise out there right after work but that is
sort of why I need to know what time you are flying in.  wednesday is the
best day for me to come out but if need be I can skip my soccer game on
Thursday and come out.  Fill me in on the details and give me a number where
I can reach you.  Make sure that you bring my cell phone number with you so
that you can get a hold of me when you get in town.  Have you talked to
Burns to figure anything out yet. Let me know!!
See you soon, lot so love, kim
Call me sometime today if you get a chance or else I will call your cell
from later today!!
Cheers, little woody!!
