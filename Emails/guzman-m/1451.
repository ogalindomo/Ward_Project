Hey guys, I'm getting into PDX on Saturday afternoon and Stacie & I wanted
to know if any of you were available to do anything Saturday night.  I
realize the 23rd is very close to XMAS and there is a high probability of
respective family events.  Regardless, if you are free, Stacie & I are
going to hit the town and would love to hang.  Obviously significant
others, or anybody else is welcome.  This ain't no restricted affair (So
Stubbe you are allowed to bring your gay lover!!!!).  See ya...

P.S. We can save the Dolphin outing for another night.
