I have modified the path for the EES sheet once again.  We need to make a new 
sheet and email it to Neil Bresnan at EES for each day.  Please use the 
format developed for the 24th and 26th in the folder.  EES is confused by 
seeing both buy and sell prices.  I would also prefer that we do not disclose 
who we bought or sold to.

The sheets should now be in P/Realtime/EES/Feb 01/02_26

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: EES SUMMARY SHEET

The EES summary sheet is now in P/Realtime/EES/EES FEB.  Just copy the EES 
deals over from the Inc. Sheet. Do not copy any colums past the Sell Price 
colum as it is not necessary for EES to have all our Info.
