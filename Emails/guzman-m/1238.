I do not like to recieve these emails.  PLEASE update the dispatch log 
immediately after being dispatched.

The Enron Canada dispatch log and updating the El Paso Reconciliation sheet 
are considered to be important performance criteria (just like inadvertancy) 
with regards to customer service and settlements

The last time that the dispatch log was updated was 1/27/01, can your guys 
bring the log up to date?  

Thanks
