Why is the fact that I'm moving down there making you you lean towards
staying up here?

I don't know for sure if I am.  I am just in the "seriously thinking about
it" stages.  However the fact that you are moving down there is definetly
making me lean toward staying up here.  Tell your mom if you move and I
stay she can adopt me.
