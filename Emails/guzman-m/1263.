Hey Mark,

Sorry for not contacting you sooner regarding the Vegas trek.  I had planned
on heading to Los Angeles for that weekend to visit a buddy.  He is now
moving into a new house with his girlfriend this weekend and will be busy
with that.

Doesn't look like I will be heading to Vegas now either.  I guess that I
will spend the weekend helping Dahl try to get that scow of his pieced back
together.  What a project that has evolved into.

I plan on watching the game at my bro's bar.  Not quite Cesar's Palace or
MGM, but it will have to do...

Have a great time!  I hope you make it back in one piece.  You will have to
give me some of the good details when you get back.

Good luck,

Patrick Mains
