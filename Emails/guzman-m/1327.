I would love to do that!!  And like I said, I realized I have every right to
go out with a friend (girl or boy) if I want to.  If he wants to be
insecure, then that's his problem.  Does your offer still stand??  If so,
when?

Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do
something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads
insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would
be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't
still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating
dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back.
