REMINDER.....she is here today:

If you are interested in ordering gift baskets for the holiday season, either 
personally or for that favorite customer, then you won't want to miss this.  
Renee Lange, owner of Baskets and More will be here Friday, November 17 at 
10:30 AM in Mt. Bachelor to show off her holiday line of gift baskets.  In 
the past we have used Renee extensively for customer appreciation baskets, 
the response is always positive!

Feel free to stop by, see  what Renee has to offer and place any orders.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mollie
