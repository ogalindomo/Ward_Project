Subject: UPDATE: CHANGED!! Line Derate that will affect our WALC transmisison 
for 1/9 and 1/10

Chuck called back to tell us the maintenance for the 10th is now going to be 
done on the 23rd of Jan.

So,  the 10th we are back to full capacity, and we will go to zero on Jan 
23rd, HE8-16.

Due to Scheduled Maintenance, our WALC tranny from San Juan to Midway

January 9,  HE 10 and HE 11 go to zero

January 10,  HE 8 through HE 16  go to zero (all times are PST)

Chuck from WAPA-LC called this in.

This derate will need to be recorded in the available transmission 
spreadsheet for Real time.
