yourself with the procedure then check with me if you have questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: FASTEST, EASIEST, AND CORRECT WAY TO HANDLE COLSTRIP CUTS IN ENPOWER

1.)In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the 
total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC 
index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an 
offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission 
fee is $2.52

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- 
specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit 
Stone.
 (these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in 
lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) check real time postion manager, you should be flat after this.


This is basically how Diana Scholtes explained it to me.  It worked and 
hopefully it will work for all
