Group,

We need to re-market  3 MW  of Louisiana Pacific starting HE 1100 PPT Feb 23 
and all day Sat Feb 24.    These deals should be made under LT-NW (ALL 
DEALS).  We will be long PGE purchase at Colstrip and can route the deals to 
this PGE deal.  These deals should go in the services sheet using Holden's 
formulas.  You may want to bundle the 3 mws (maybe with Willamette or MPC) to 
beat a price of $170.  Please send me an email with the deal numbers and the 
sale prices and I will make the annuity to make sure that we get paid.

Thank you for your help.

Bill
