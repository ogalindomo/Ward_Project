When Bill Miller calls to sell megawatts for a minimum price,   make sure 
that you follow up with an adjustment bid to ensure that fixed price.
If you are confused on whether to adjust or not,  ask him well before the 
deadline to adjust bid.

We had some confusion on this issue on Friday.    If you have any questions 
on this issue let me know.
