greetings
i really need your money.  right now three people have sent in checks (i 
havent checked today's mail yet).  so my plan is to set up the batting order 
by when the checks are received.  so right now we have:
marty nance
reuben schug
brendan "lets play some ball" fisher
as you can see, we go from bad to worse (just kidding, dont put a stop 
payment on your checks!)  so to go back to my main point - i really need your 
money.  the registration deadline is coming up.  i will start calling people 
next week, i dont know how often people check e-mail.  hope everyone has a 
good weekend.
