We have length on peak Monday, 04-23 in NP-15.  The energy is in PGE3, 25 mws 
are under ST-WBOM and 56 mws are in ST-CALI.  We need to sell all 81 mws.  In 
Enpower we buy the 25 mws from imbalance under ST-WBOM, and sell them under 
ST-WBOM.  ST-WBOM is long at $230.  We buy the 56 mws under the ST-CALI book 
and then sell it off for a profit split under the ST-CALI book.  I will be in 
Seattle this weekend.  If you have any questions, you can reach me on my cell 
phone.

Thanks,
Bill
