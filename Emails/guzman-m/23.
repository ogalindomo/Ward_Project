Fraters,

Thank you to the guys that came on Saturday for the BBQ/Game.  I can speak 
for the house in saying that we enjoyed having you come down.  We look 
forward to the next time we can get together.

For those who missed it, we will be having more events to come in the near 
future.  This includes a Golf Tournament, alumni/rush event, and more 
football in the fall.  Stay tuned for details!

Also, I would appreciate it if you could take the time time to fill out this 
survey:

It will help me start and maintain a database of Tau Chapter Alumni.  This 
also will give me an idea of who is reading the emails that I send out.  
Thank you for taking the five minutes out of your time to fill it out.

YITB,

Ryan Hildebrand
