That is weird.  I never see any of your friends.  (Except for that time I
saw Julie and Marcus.)  I suppose that's because I hang out at places where
there's girls and your friends are afraid of girls.

Did I tell you I saw Kathy Chaney at Cobalt Lounge about 3 weeks ago, and
then the next day i was that Prisilla (sp?) at Scooters?  I just thought it
was wierd seeing two of your friends on two succesive evenings.
