I talked to Jorge last night and we thought we'd just hang out at his place
or see a movie on Saturday night.     Steve's family is coming over on
Sunday for dinner and so is Donald.

that's all I know.     I'm not sure about skiiing.     Jorge and Cherie
have been snow shoeing lately and that might be fun since it includes them
in the activity and I have never done that.   Donald also snow shoes.    We
can decide Saturday, but I'm definitely up for an activity.
see ya,
dave
