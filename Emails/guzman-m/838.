Hi Friends.
I received this from my friend Chris who is a music lover and I thought this
was a worthy cause to pass on to you.  No Napster means no more downloading
music off the internet.  You can easily send an email from the Napster
website to your state representative.  So speakout! and pass it on.
Peace,
Em
