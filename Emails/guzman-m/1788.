Yeah, it's a long story but basically, he doesn't have a solid offer for me.
But he has connections with some REO directors of some good companies like
Advanta and he said he would give me great recommendations.  He has already
given my name and his recommendations to the REO director of Advanta and I
guess that guy wants to talk to me.

The fact that you are moving down there has nothing to do with whether or
not I do.  I was just joking.  Stop be so over analytical.  :)   Did you
talk to Danny about the offer?
