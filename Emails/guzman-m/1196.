Hey!

There is a new spreadsheet with all our BPA Account numbers summarised in a 
PIVOT table. The file is in P:RealTime/RT BPA ACCOUNT #'S. By filtering by 
individual source, sink , Type (Firm / Non Firm) you will get the account 
number. Make sure all is not selected in any of the fields as this can give 
you an invalid account number.
