Dave Ryan, our meteorologist from Houston, will be in the office this 
Thursday and Friday, November 9th and 10th.  He will be presenting weather 
skill testing and weather forecasts on the 9th from 1:00-2:00, and on the 
10th from 12:00-1:00 (luncheon meeting-please see me if you have special 
dietary requirements).  

If you would like to attend either of these meetings, please let me know by 
the end of tomorrow, Tuesday.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Anna
