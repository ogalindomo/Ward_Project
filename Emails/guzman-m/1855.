If you work in West Power Trading, congratulations!  All West Power Trading 
employees are eligible to receive a pair of tickets to a Blazers game this 
season, compliments of Enron.  If you are interested in getting a pair of 
tickets to a Blazer game, come by Mt. Hood Conference Room at 11:30 a.m., 
Monday, November 6.  

We will draw employee names from a hat (or container) to determine the order 
of selection.  Once the order of selection has been determined, there will be 
a signup sheet with available games listed, and you can sign up for the date 
that works best for you by signing your name next to the available date.   If 
your name is drawn, you will have one minute to write your date selection on 
the signup sheet.  Listed below are the dates available for selection, so 
plan ahead and be ready to select from remaining dates once the selection 
process begins.  Greg Wolfe or Chris Foster will be there to oversee the 
signup process since I will be in Houston for training Monday through 
Wednesday next week.

Guidelines for using the tickets are as follows.
  - Eligible employees can receive a pair of tickets.
  - The employee who is given the tickets must attend the game.
  - Tickets cannot be sold or given away.
  - The guest can be a friend, spouse, or another Enron employee.
  - If the employee cannot attend the game, the tickets must be returned to 
me or Debra.
  - Any complaints about this process or the guidelines will result in 
forfeiture of tickets.

If you are going to be out of the office on Monday, November 6, please let me 
or Debra know.  Arrangements will be made for you to get a pair of tickets.  
Call me or Debra if you have any questions.
