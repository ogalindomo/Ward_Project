Unlike other transmission providers, when we buy transmission from APS, the 
Start Time and End Time are both HOUR ENDING.  According to them, they are 
"the leaders of the pack."  So, if we want to purchase tranny for HE 14 FC to 
PV (like I did today), both the start time and end time would be 14:00.  Make 
sure that you have the right time zone as well.
