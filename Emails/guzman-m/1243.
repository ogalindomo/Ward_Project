At the website below is the new congestion management proposal.  Sections 
three and four of the proposal pertain to real-time.  I believe it would be 
in our best interest to understand this proposal with regards to SC bids and 
loop flow coordination.  Please take a look at the proposal on the site below 
and provide me with your feedback.

Thank you,
Bill
