Paul -

CSC is short for "Child Services Center".  It is what used to be Washington
High School.  The adress is SE 14th and Stark.  The gym is south of Stark,
between Stark and Morrison.

Mike,

Can I get the directions or address to tomorrow's match for the Fractals, I
think it is at 7pm in the csc 1.  Also thanks for being flexible in
changing our schedule.

Regards,

Paul
