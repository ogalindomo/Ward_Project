fyi,  opening day for the dodgers is Monday, April 2nd against Milwaukee.
It's a 1:00 day game.     The girls happen to have a four day weekend that
week and they are coming down for Karen's shower on Saturday......   so, I
was planning on booking tickets for us on that day.

Let me know if you are interested and I will book you a ticket... or more
if you want extra.     Field box seats are $17 in the outfields,  so  I'll
probably just book those instead of getting scalper tickets.
