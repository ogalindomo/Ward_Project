All,

I would like to take this opportunity to inform everyone that effective March 
1, (Today) Heather Dunton has moved into a new role with the West Desk Risk 
Management Group reporting to Stacey White in Houston.

It has been a pleasure working with Heather over the last 2 years in the 
Volume Management Group.  She has enabled us (Enron) to take our services 
business to levels which would not have been possible with out her.  Her 
detailed knowledge of our internal / external customer needs along with her 
in-depth knowledge of California tariffs and operational protocol have made 
her an invaluable asset to the team.  Her contributions will be missed.

Please join me in wishing Heather as much success in her new role.

Thanks - MO
