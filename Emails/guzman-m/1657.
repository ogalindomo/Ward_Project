I have spent the day working with Kathy at EPE to correct the models for last 
week.  Every day from 17th through 20th (so far) has had formula errors.  
There is absolutely no excuse for this.  Check the formulas to ensure they 
are correct before emailing it to EPE every day.  It is an easy thing to fix 
and failure to so makes us look bad.
