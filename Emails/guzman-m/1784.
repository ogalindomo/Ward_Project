So did I.  Ever since he left Wilshire, 1 year ago, whenever we talk he
tells me how much he could really use me down there and how I could make a
lot of money working for him.  (You remember.) But when we talked seriously
yesterday afternoon, he said that was when he was going to start outsourcing
and doing REO's.  But they couldn't get the staff to handle it so they
decided not to.  They are in the process of talking about it again, and if
they do decide to go in that direction, they will deffinately need me.
Whatever, it sounded like he was just talking out of his ass.  But I do
believe he could help me out, should I decide to make the move.

So, i have a question.  If Danny has been constantly asking you to come
work for him how come he is now trying to get you a job somewhere else?  I
thought he wanted you to work for him?
