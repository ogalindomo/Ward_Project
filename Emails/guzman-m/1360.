When you are scheduling the two Wheelabrator units, please use the following 
counterparties in CAPS:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  Wheelabrat
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WheelSHAST

We account for these separately and thus they need to be scheduled as two 
separate entities.  

In Enpower there are two counterparties set up as well:

MARTEL_2_AMFOR:  WHEELABRMA
WSENGY_1_Unit 4:  WHEELABRSH

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions,

Kourtney
