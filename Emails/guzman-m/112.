I had some requests for directions, so I will give them to you all once
again.  It will be a good time.  I am looking forward to seeing all of you.

Festivities begin around 6:30 or 7 PM.

My phone # is 682-8061 in case you get lost.

From the North:
Take I-5 south to the 2nd Wilsonville exit.  Take exit and turn left on to
Wilsonville Rd.  Take first right after overpass on to Parkway Dr. (Landmark
is 76 station).  Follow Parkway down about 1.5 miles (will pass Best Western
Hotel).  Take first right onto Kalyca.  Go to end of Kalyca and turn left
onto Chia Loop.  House is in the back of cul-de-sac.  Number is 31369.

From the South:
Take I-5 north to first Wilsonville exit.  Turn right onto Wilsonville Rd.,
then take immediate right onto Parkway.  Follow directions as above.

Very hard to get lost.

Any questions---email Elizah
