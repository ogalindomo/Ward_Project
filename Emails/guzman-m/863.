Guz,

I have a dinner party Friday evening just outside of
Portland and nothing else friday night.  I have to be at
the church around 3:00 Saturday afternoon for
preparations for the wedding.

I am fully ready for a big weekend in Portland.  Let's
get it on.  I will give you a call later in the week.
