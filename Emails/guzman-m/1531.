Please do not just change the volume of these transmission deals,  the unused 
portion needs to be kept in scheduling, as MidC to MidC transmission.

Please take a moment to look at November 29th in Scheduling for an example of 
this. 

The reason:  We have to pay for all of this transmission whether we use it or 
not, and just changing the volume makes us off with them for settlements.

I will be happy to help you if you need it.
