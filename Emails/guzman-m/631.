Beaver Football Lovin' Fraters,

Spring is upon us and that means spring football!  Saturday, April 28th, 1pm 
at Reser Stadium is the annual inter-squad scrimmage.  We will be going, 
flasks in hand, to the game.  So, we would like to extend an invitation to 
any fraters that would like to join us.  If enough interest is gained we will 
put together a BBQ.

Check out this link for more info on the team:

There is also a Fun Run that morning:

Please reply by April 21st, if you have any interest, and we will see what we 
can put together.

YITB,

Ryan Hildebrand
