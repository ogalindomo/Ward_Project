It's that time again....

The deadline for everyone to input his/her time into the system is 
Tuesday-October 31 at 1:00pm.  Please enter your time today and send me an 
e-mail to let me know that your time has been entered.  If you need help 
entering your time, I would be happy to assist.  If you missed the last 
time-entry period, you may select the link Previous in the "Data Entry 
Period" box.

Please remember to enter the receiver cost center number - 105900 - on your 
timesheet.  If your cost center number is 105900 already, you don't need to 
enter it. 
Also, for those of you who haven't ordered calendars, please let me know if 
you are interested in picking one out.

If you have questions, please let me know.  Thank you in advance for your 
cooperation.
