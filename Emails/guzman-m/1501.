Cold Weather In US Northwest Limits Imports
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A spokeswoman for the California Independent System
Operator said she expected the ISO would need to declare a stage two power
emergency at an earlier time Wednesday than Tuesday, when the alert was
called at 5:10 PM PST (0110 GMT Wednesday).
Temperatures in the Northwest are once again colder than expected, meaning
there are practically no electricity imports from that region, the ISO's
Stephanie McCorkle said.
About 8,500 megawatts remain off the power grid, as has been the case for
several days, McCorkle said.
The ISO currently has a request out for bids for up to 5,000 MW of
out-of-state power. Recent requests have been between 3,000 MW to 4,000 MW.
The ISO's Tuesday stage two emergency, which means power reserves are below
5%, was precipitated by a unit off line at the Intermountain Power Agency in
Utah.
That plant provides about 840 MW of generation to California and Utah
municipal utilities, and about 840 MW to the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, which in turn can sell the power to the ISO.
