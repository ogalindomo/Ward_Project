Who should I speak with about policies for setting up new/remote office?  Are 
there any?  Likewise, I have a copy of the Risk Mgt Policy (amended 
10/20/99).  Are there other policies or related that I should be aware of?  
I'm getting more of these type of questions and am not clear on what exists 
beyond what I already have so some central file or point of contact would 
help.  

More immediately, we're evaluating new SFA procedures traditionally focused 
on the banks.  It's possible our capital requirements could be impacted and 
on a worst case basis EEL's capital requirement could be substantial.  I'll 
keep you posted on anything major.
