Has anything similar to the following ever been completed by Paul Waine or 
anyone else in CRM (London or Houston)?  Where canI find similar risk 
controls studies or questionnaires (hard copy or electronic) for AA or others 
(ie. SFA, SEC for ECT Securities)?

As part of the Business Risk Management Process (BRM) we will be reviewing 
the processes for setting up and managing the remote offices. 
This review will be conducted by Arthur Andersen who will be reporting to me 
directly.

The review requires input from many areas of the business which have been 
identified in the attached chart. I would be grateful if you could complete 
the sections of the questionnaire that have been identified as  relevant to 
yourself. 

To complete the questionnaire you are required to provide an answer to each 
question raised  by marking one of the evaluation boxes  and providing any 
comments that you feel are relevant.

If you are able to complete  other sections of the questionnaire , please 
feel free to do so as the more input we receive the better . Similarly  
please add any additional comments or suggestions concerning the setting up 
or management of remote offices  not covered in the questionnaire.

The questionnaire should be returned by 20 December to  Sarah Williams of AA 
with a copy to myself

If you have any questions do not hesitate to call myself or Sarah

Many thanks for your co-operation.
