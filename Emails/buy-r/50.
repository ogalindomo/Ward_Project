Subject: RAC final pack

Hi Steve,

I am attaching the final version of your 2001 plan so that you get a chance 
to review it before our meeting on Monday. 

The new pack reflects any changes that were discussed at our last meeting, 
namely  a reduction in training courses to 2 per person and an increase in 
economy versus business flights .

I have also revisited the 2000 forecast and adjusted where necessary to 
reflect most recent running rates. I have  changed the 2000 headcount figures 
to reflect November actuals and have assumed no new starters in December so 
if this is inaccurate I will need to amend here. 

You will need to view the "direct" and "rsc" sheets to see the information. 


Let me know if you have any problems.

Many Thanks

Carmel
