Everyone,  - PLEASE DO NOT ERASE THE EMAIL --PLEASE RESPOND!!!!

Project Gem is approaching and Enron is going global with Windows 2000 
Migration.  They are trying to assist RAC in implementing the Migration in a 
successful fashion.  To do this, they have requested an inventory of each 
computer within RAC.   The Network managers have created a simplier and 
easier way to do this.   Each Group within RAC will have a Contact Person to 
work closely with them.  His name is Lee Steele.

Lee Steele, Manager of Enron Networks will be sending each of us an email 
regarding the Windows 2000 Migration.  He would like an inventory of each 
employees' computer applications.  On the said email that each of you receive 
from Lee, PLEASE open the link from your own computer.   According to Lee, 
this is very important because once you open the email, by clicking on the 
link, it will automatically list each application you have.   ....so again, 
please pay close attention to the Email from Lee Steele.


Lee, 

Look forward to receiving your email.


Thank you in advance.

Dorothy
