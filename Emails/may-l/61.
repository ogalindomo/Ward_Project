When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of
John, do you truly love me more than these?'
'Yes Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
Jesus said, 'Feed my lambs.'...
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' He
said, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.'
John 21:15,  17b (NIV)

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. The first time Jesus said,
"Do you truly love (Greek agape: volitional, self-sacrificial love) me more
than these?" The second time, Jesus focused on Peter alone and still used
the word translated into Greek, phileo (signifying affection, affinity, or
brotherly love) and asked, in effect, "Are you even my friend?" Each time
Peter responded with the word translated into Greek as phileo. Jesus doesn't
settle for quick, superficial answers. He has a way of getting to the heart
of the matter. Peter had to face his true feelings and motives when Jesus
confronted him. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you truly love
me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even his friend?
