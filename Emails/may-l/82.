I have done a crappy job of being a witness and a friend.  You are correct,
and rightly so about the way I have patronized you.  It has not been a
conscious effort, but I understand your perspective and as I look at me, I
am forced to admit you are correct.  Christian hypocrites are a dime a
dozen, and I am ashamed that I have fallen far short of what He has called
me to be.

I am very thankful for your business over that last 3 years.  I know that my
success here has been largely because of your help and business and I and my
family thank you for it.

I have taken your name off the Daily Word distribution list as you have
requested.  My best to you and your family and your success in business.  It
is my hope that I can be a better friend, witness and more to you again.

Thanks for
