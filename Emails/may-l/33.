Again Jesus said, 'Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am
sending you.'
John 20:21 (NIV)

Jesus again identified himself with his Father. He told the disciples by
whose authority he did his work. Then he passed the job to his disciples of
spreading the gospel of salvation around the world. Whatever God has asked
you to do, remember: (1) your authority comes from God, and (2) Jesus has
demonstrated by words and actions how to accomplish the job he has given
you. As the Father sent Jesus, Jesus sends his followers...and you.
