Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey
him.'

Daniel 7:27 (NIV)

Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing.
Help us to praise:
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.
"Come, Thou Almighty King" Italian Hymn (c. 1757)

Lord God, we yearn for the day when You will reign.... but we are not
alone. You are with us, beside us, above us, beneath us and within us. We
trust You to see us through to the other side of this troubled time. Stir up
Your Holy Spirit in us so that we can be peacemakers in the midst of
conflict, and sow a harvest of righteousness.
