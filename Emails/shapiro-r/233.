With the continued growth of some of the more non-traditional businesses at 
Enron; e.g., broadband, agricultural commodities, steel, etc..., it has 
become apparent that additional support from Government Affairs, of these and 
other non-traditional businesses, is necessary.  To that end, I've asked 
Harry Kingerski to focus his time and efforts more fully on developing his 
support group's (Government Affairs Support Services) capabilities, with an 
objective of broadening their support beyond EES and ENA.  With the void that 
Harry leaves in formally directing our group's efforts on behalf of EES, I've 
asked Jim Steffes to assume a leadership role with respect to EES as well as 
ENA. I've also asked Lisa Yoho to assume responsibility for Enron Industrial 
Markets in addition to her responsibility for Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Networks.  No further organizational changes are being made at this time but, 
as always, organizational flexibility in how our group responds to the needs 
of the business units will be the order of the day.  I am confident that all 
of us will support Harry, Lisa and Jim with their additional 
responsibilities. Thank you.
