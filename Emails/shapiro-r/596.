Attached is a copy of the NYISO's just released decision regarding the 
appeals that had been taken concerning the Penalties and Public Disclosure 
proposals recently approved by the Management Committee (MC). In brief, the 
ISO Board agrees that such a proposal is desirable and should be put in place 
this summer, but finds fault with some of the provisions and omissions from 
the MC approved proposal. The Board directs its staff to begin to develop 
tariff provisions to implement a modified program to be filed with FERC as 
soon as possible after receipt from FERC of its decision on the proposed 
circuit breaker (now referred to as the automated mitigation procedures or 
AMP). Since a circuit breaker proposal will be voted on by the MC on May 23, 
even if passed and immediately filed with FERC, a decision regarding the 
circuit breaker is not likely to be forthcoming until July under even an 
expedited schedule. We will continue to work with other suppliers in opposing 
this program.
