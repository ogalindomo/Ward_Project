On behalf of Government Affairs, Bob Frank and I thank you for taking time on 
January 11 to join us for the presentation on the potential impact of 
international trade rules on your business units.  I am requesting your 
feedback regarding the trade regulation seminar.  We are trying to gauge the 
level of interest/need among traders, originators and other EIM personnel 
before retaining Powell Goldstein to monitor international trade issues and 
developments for EIM. We spoke to several of you after the seminar and heard 
some interest.    For the pulp/paper group, the most pressing issues related 
to the upcoming expiration of the US-Canada Softwood Lumber Agreement and 
anti-dumping litigation.  On the steel side, the primary issues include 
ongoing anti-dumping litigation, the possibility of a multilateral steel 
agreement and potential congressional initiatives.  Please e-mail me your 
thoughts or call me at (202) 466-9158.   

As promised, attached below is the power point presentation that Dan Price 
referred to during the seminar (in Lotus Note File Viewer).

P.S. For those of you that attended the afternoon seminar and expressed 
concern about Peter Suchman, he has fully recovered from what turned out to 
be a bad case of stomach flu.
