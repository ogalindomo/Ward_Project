Andy, I need to determine where our outreach for ACCF stands.  At present, 
Jeff Skilling is slated to attend an ACCF dinner on September 11.  They are 
obviously bugging me about the dinner arrangements AND our fund-raising 
outreach.  I probably need to cancel Jeff's appearance if we are not going to 
do their solicitation.  Thanks.
