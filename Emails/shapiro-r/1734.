As you may recall, Portland General submitted a request to FERC for 
authorization to use EnronOnline.  Due to FERC's affiliate restrictions, PGE 
currently is not able to use EnronOnline and is concerned that it is being 
excluded from parts of the market due to the restrictions.  We made a similar 
filing on behalf of EPMI, proposing to remove the affiliate restrictions for 
those transactions that EPMI enters into with PGE through EnronOnline.

The PGE and EPMI filings are on FERC's July 11 agenda.  Although the FERC 
staffers conducting the inquiry into EnronOnline have told us that their 
inquiry is not related to the PGE and EPMI applications, FERC's order will be 
the first pronouncement from FERC on EnronOnline since this new inquiry began.

We'll keep you posted and will send out the order as soon as we receive it.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.
