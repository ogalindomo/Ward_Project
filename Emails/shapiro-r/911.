I would recommend that Jose Bestard be the named person unless there will be 
a number of meetings in the very near term.  It is my understanding that Jose 
will be returning to the US and will take this issue on as the lead no later 
than August 01.  If any of this is incorrect, I should be named.

Finally, does a VP cover the need for "executive"?  Jose and I are both VPs.  
Do we need a higher level - say MD?

Subject: NERC Stakeholder and BOT Meeting

I have summarized the action items for the NERC meeting in Wash DC Monday 
June 11.

Dick and I will be attending a pre-meeting at EPSA Monday morinng along with 
other concerned transmission customers to discuss the action items, 
particularly the proposed composition of the Stakeholder Committee.

We also need to be thinking about who from Enron should be the named member.  
The criteria proposed is that he must be executive level and be able to 
attend the meetings.
