Attached is a description of the action plan for the Load Curtailment efforts 
in CA, ME, and NY this Summer.  If someone from the deal team has not yet 
contacted you, they will be very soon.  If not, let me know.  

The general idea is that we will play against the ISO Load programs with our 
new technology (Sue I know about Cal ISO credit risk).  EES believes that 
with the tremendous amount of volatility this may be a great product.

Fred - I'll leave it to you to set up either one big call or some other 
process to contact appropriate Govt Affairs people.

Jim
