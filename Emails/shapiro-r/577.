After our very useful meeting with you yesterday, Sophie, and your HR 
colleague (Georgina? - I didn't get her surname), I have received from 
Viviana this follow up e-mail to a short conversation I had with her last 
week. You will recall that Paul stated his expectations at our meeting about 
the outcome of Viviana's next performance review. She has effectively started 
explaining her grievances to me. Your advice would be welcome.

Subject: Follow up last week meeting

Hello Peter, 

hope you're fine. 

I'm wondering whether it would be possible for you to call me today, because 
I would like to continue with you the discussion we started last week when I 
was in London.

I have to admit that I'm quite worried and I do not know what to expect. 

Thank you very much in advance. 

Viviana
