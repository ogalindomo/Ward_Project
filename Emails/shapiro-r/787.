Subject: Calls to/from Commissioner Hebert

Maureen,

I've checked Linda Robertson's call sheet from January 2001 and do not find 
any record of incoming calls from Commissioner Hebert to Linda.
Nonetheless, she may have initiated a call TO him.

I'ved tried to reach Linda on her cell phone -- no success.  Perhaps Rick 
could raise this question with Linda when he joins her on the 11:00 AM (CDT) 
conference call today?

I'm also checking with Sarah Novosel and Joe Hartsoe -- both of whom are out 
at meetings at the present time.  When I get any responses I'll let you know.
Thanks for holding down the fort!

Lora
