Subject: Update on GridFlorida and TCCs

Steve ,

The following is a quick update on  two important  issues ;

GridFlorida ....As you know from my last update we have a very good "Market 
Representation " on the Advisory Committee and at the first meeting last week 
we formed a Market Design Working Group (MDWG) to work on developing an 
improved Market Design in Florida. I have been voted in as the Chairman of 
the committee and our first order of business will be to improve the 
Congestion Management proposals and to develop a Real Time Energy Spot Market 
with "uncovered" and "unbalanced " schedules  . We now have the right  people 
in place and the real battle now begins .
.

TCCs..............We did very well and continue to grow the  business .The 
results of the winter TCCs season are now tabulated and they are as follows ;

We have expanded our portfolio for the upcoming summer period and expect to 
increase our revenues over that period .We are on track to exceed our goal of 
$10 million for calendar 2001.
