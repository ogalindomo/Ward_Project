There are a number of issues surrounding Project Summer that need to be 
addressed by a series of swat teams.  Outlined in the attached table is a 
listing of these swat teams, each task force's objectives, participants 
including the person responsible for organizing the meetings (the underlined 
names), and targeted completion date. In addition to the participants listed 
and dependent on the team and objectives, representatives from internal 
legal, VE and CSFB may be added to the Corp side and representatives from 
Skadden and UBS may be added to the Buyer's side.

Unless otherwise noted in the attached sheet, the purpose of these committees 
is NOT to negotiate the transaction, but instead to provide information and 
feedback to the deal team on a cooperative basis. Also attached is a 
description of the current status of the negotiations which highlights the 
key structural and risk sharing aspects of the transaction and provides the 
proper background for performing your group's tasks.  Of course, this 
information is highly confidential and should be used only for the purpose of 
completing your tasks.

Any questions on the Corp participants can be directed to me.  Frank Stabler 
will coordinate the participation of the Buyers team.

 Given the accelerated timetable in which we are trying to execute this 
transaction, it is imperative that we tackle these issues as soon as 
possible.  Please keep  myself and/or Frank Stabler informed as to your 
progress and any difficulties in meeting the time schedule.
