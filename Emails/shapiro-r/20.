Rick,

Thank you for your participation in the  Analyst  program.  One of the goals 
is to evaluate our interns in order to consider them for placement in the 
future.  In that regard, please find the attached Mid-Summer Evaluation form 
for summer interns.  This should be completed and returned by July 7, 2000.  
Please note that the interns currently being evaluated started work prior to 
June 5th.  

We will begin scheduling feedback meetings with Managers, Staffing 
Coordinators and Summer Analyst for completion by July 14th (or 28th).  If 
you have any questions, please contact me at x3-4584.

Thank you,
Shelly Butler
