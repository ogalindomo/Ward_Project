Rick - 

attached is the variance report for the month of March; the actuals are for 
March only and as you can see we are 1.3 million over budget for the month; I 
sent Elizabeth an email about the Hardy budget but it appears as though his 
budget has not been added but we are now absorbing costs for his group;  I'll 
work with Elizabeth to find out the status of moving the Hardy budget into 
yours or do you want the budget moved into the Washington cost center; please 
let me know

Eric
