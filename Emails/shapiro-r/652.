Please see the attached New Democrat Coalition Energy Policy outline.  While 
not a comprehensive document, it does NOT call for price caps.  The New Dem 
plan does call for the development of national interconnection, as well as a 
creation of an Energy Reliability Organization to help facilitate the role of 
RTOs.  

This is in stark comparison to the DNC and Democratic Policy Committees 
approach.
