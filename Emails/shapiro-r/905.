RE: Revised EPSA Draft Paper on Assuring Adequate
      Capacity in a Competitive Market
      ?Conference Call on Friday, June 8th at 11:00 a.m. (EDT)

On May 29th EPSA circulated a draft position on the issues raised during our 
earlier meeting on assuring adequate capacity in a competitive market.  We 
invited comments on that draft and promised to circulate a revised draft in 
advance of conference call scheduled on Friday, June 8th to discuss this 
issue further.

Attached are two documents.  One is an extensively red-lined version of the 
May 29th draft based on comments forwarded from several members.  Where 
possible, we have incorporated suggested changes and identified, with 
brackets ([ ]), alternative proposals or issues needing further discussion.  
Also attached is an alternative set of bullets drafted by Jeff Roark at 
Mirant suggesting an another way to organize the points.  Thank you all for 
your time and effort on this project.

Please review both documents in preparation for Friday's call, which will be 
held at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the conference call, dial 1-800-937-6563 
and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions or concerns 
in advance of the call, please contact Julie at 202-628-8200.
