Title: The Battle of the Destination Clauses
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2378

EUROPEAN GAS REPORT-THE BATTLE OF THE DESTINATION CLAUSES
The next round in the long war over competition in European gas is being 
fought
on a new battleground-destination clauses that sit within (or alongside) many
long-term contracts for gas supply in Europe. The Directorate General for
Competition of the European Commission (DG COMP) recently said it has been
investigating several long-term take-or-pay contracts for over a year to make
sure that destination clauses fall in line with European Union (EU) 
competition
laws.

* The abolition of territorial restriction clauses would be a prelude to more
widespread renegotiation of long-term take-or-pay contracts and would bring
genuine competition in European gas markets.

* In parallel with the pressure from the competition authorities, new
commercial opportunities appear to be opening up, notably in the 
Mediterranean,
bringing further pressure to bear on the destination clauses.
