		 Subject: Some Cost savings for Alamac

We are still working to get CP&L to reduce the interconnection fees by the 
existing plant amount (appr. $1.5 million).  However, I did get CP&L to 
recalculate the monthly O&M/replacement fee from the "state" calculation to 
the "FERC" calculation.  Heather said that this change alone results in a 
$140,000/year savings because the deal model had the higher fees built in.
