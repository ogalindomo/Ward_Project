Rick:   I'm not sure the Law Conference should count, but it's your call.

Lisa - 

attached is an updated status report on training programs taken by EGA 
employees; I received a couple responses to the email we sent yesterday and 
have made note of those changes on this report

I got a couple of emails from people confirming that the Enron Law Conference 
counts toward the 3 course requirement; it's my understanding that attendance 
at the Law Conference would count but will need you and/or Rick to confirm; 
right now I've counted it

I'll keep you updated as I learn of new courses taken, etc.

Eric
