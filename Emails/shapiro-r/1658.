Steve, Rick,
Attached is a letter we would like to send to the Oregon delegation today. 
Peggy Fowler is concerned that our Senators are being solicited by the
Washington delegation to support west-wide refunds so speed in getting our
position out is essential.

Please let us know your thoughts.
Call either me at 503-464-8860
or Doug Nichols at 503-464-8402

Sarah - I could not locate Steve or Linda Robertson in my address group.
could you please forward on this message to them?
thanks.

Jay Dudley
