Today's Washington Post reports on an interview with FERC commissioners Wood 
and Massey following yesterday's hearing before the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee.  According to the Post, each commissioner said they are 
prepared to make "heavy refunds" because of overcharging in California.  They 
each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the 
upcoming settlement conference first.  The Post article (which was on the 
front page of the business section, perhaps an indication of the somewhat 
diminished press coverage of the issue) mentioned Enron in a list of 
companies "facing allegations of overcharges."

There are also news reports that Gov. Davis met with commissioners Wood and 
Brownell while he was in town.  The same reports say that Gov. Davis will 
meet with commissioner Wood in California on  Monday.
