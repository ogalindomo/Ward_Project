Colleagues:

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the 
largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure.  I am confident of 
your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this 
ambitious schedule on time  (the process will start on April 23rd and 
conclude by May 25th, 2001).

Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs 
required from you  in a faster, and more cost-effective manner.  We are also 
working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user 
friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the 
intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the 
required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the 
time comes (it is the second stage of the process).   

Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this 
coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your 
comments and suggestions.  

Best regards

Sounds great.  My understanding is that URM is ready to go.

Subject: The production schedule to update and review the largest 50 curves.

Jim, Scott:

Please find below the production schedule to update and review the regulatory 
component of the largest 50 curves (75% of net positions).  The process will 
start on April 23rd and conclude by May 25th, 2001.  The Team here is  
working very closely with Jeff and Rick to systemize the process so that we 
put the right foot forward, always, and repetitively  (90 days intervals); I 
certainly appreciate their insight, and advice.

Please let me know if you have any question, comment, or suggestion.  

Best regards
