Attached is the Briefing Book for the 10:00 AM (EDT) Cheney meeting on 
Tuesday, April 17, 2001.

We will be making additions to this book over the weekend, and a final 
document will be ready for Ken Lay and Steve Kean on Monday evening.

By fax we are sending the attachment documents which were not available to us 
electronically.
