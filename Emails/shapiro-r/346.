I just got off the phone with Lisa and she proposes to reduce her travel 
budget by 10%; Lisa's current travel budget is $120,000.  The savings equals 
$12,000.  Lisa said she spoke to you yesterday regarding her outside services 
budget.

Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.

Eric
