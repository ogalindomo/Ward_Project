Here is an additional paragraph from ENA legal which I will add.

Under the gas contacts of ENA, a diversion of gas as a result of governmental 
action would likely be an event of force majeure excusing the performance of 
ENA.  As an aside, you should note that the vast majority of ENA's gas 
business involves deliveries to its customers at various city gates.  ENA has 
very limited exposure to transportation or pipelines owned by local 
distribution companies.
