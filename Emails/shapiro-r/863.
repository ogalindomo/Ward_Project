I received the following from David in Investor Relations.  As you can see, 
he indicated we could contact the analyst directly.  I'm not sure this is a 
good idea, but I wanted to send the info along to you in the event you might 
find it useful.  

FYI - the attached reports provided no info on Powell's meetings w/ analysts.
