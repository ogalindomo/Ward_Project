Colleagues:

I am seeking your help to compile the accomplishment for GA during the period 
Nov 2000 - April 2001.  Of course, these accomplishments are the summation of 
your efforts either individually or through your group, and the total shall 
indicate the contribution of GA to the corporate objectives of Enron.  The 
aggregation of your inputs shall be one of the primary sources that Rick and 
Steve will use in communicating GA impact to all stakeholders in the 
company.  

I would like to suggest to use the attached excel file to document your 
accomplishment for the period.  I hope that it shall assist you to identify 
your contribution, your estimate of value, and a line, or two, explaining the 
methodology you used to arrive at your value.    

I hope to receive your inputs by  May 16th (next Wednesday), so that I can 
compile the inputs and issue the first draft for discussion by Monday 21st.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.
