Seabron --

As the first installment of what we discussed earlier, I would like to 
request that you put together a short piece that we could incorporated into 
Enron's response to the FERC's June 19 Order (due on July 19 so we need it 
maybe by July 15).

Basically what we would like to do is to highlight the problems with the 
FERC's decision to implicitly use cost-of-service going forward.  We want to 
make sure that the FERC understands that less liquidity in the cash market 
has (a) reliability and (b) economic impacts for consumers.  This is should 
not be a statement that marketers are hurt, but rather focus on how the 
market is harmed.   We would like to show the FERC how the order drives 
marketers out of the real time market and the negative impact this will have 
on the real time and forward markets.  Highlight the 

The approved budget is $25,000.

Can you do this?

Also, I got your message and had heard about the Power Marketers group 
looking to put on testimony.  Not sure exactly what they are looking to do, 
but will discuss with counsel to make sure that everything is ok.
