After almost 13 years with Enron, I've decided to pursue other opportunities 
outside of the company.  While the problems in India remain challenging and I 
have enjoyed my tenure here, the job I've been offered is really too good to 
pass up.  Thus, please consider this e:mail as formal notice of my intention 
to resign from the company, effective close of business June 16, 2001.
