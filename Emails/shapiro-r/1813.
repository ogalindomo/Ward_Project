We are preparing a presentation for the Argentine Secretariat of Energy 
commenting on several subjects. We must deliver this presentation first time 
Monday morning to the power marketers association of Argentina.
One of the key subjects covered are the guarantees required to power 
marketers.
We would highly appreciate if you could check if the (1 or 2 pages) summary 
written below still reflects the reality of the market you are involved 
and/or make the necessary changes. Only focus on the market of your expertise.
If you are not the appropriate person to ask for this information, please 
tell me who is.
Please copy the answer to Andrea Calo, since she will be updating the 
document during the weekend.
Thanks.
GC
