Ginger,

Can you circulate the attached chart to Government Affairs staff.  The 
subject line should read "West Desk Organizational Chart."  Please put in the 
cover note that the chart is for internal Enron use only.

Thanks,

Alan Comnes

Alan -- Can you send an email to Ginger Dernehl (for distribution to gov't 
affairs) that lists the heads of the various desks in West Power?  I've had 
some questions from people wanting a list.  Thanks!

Do you have a similar chart for West Power?  We found this very helpful for 
Gov't Affairs people to assist trading better.  Thanks.
