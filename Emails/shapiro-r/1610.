		 Subject: Lay/Lavorato Meetings

Attached is a summary of the discussions at the meetings on June 19th.  I 
think that the meetings confirm that the key impediments to market opening 
are technical /systems readiness, concerns about pricing post-market opening 
, and Pickering A.   I will draft letters for Lay to Harris, Wilson  et al 
thanking them for the meetings and incorporating the data re Texas and 
Alberta that Lay and Lavorato used in the meetings.
