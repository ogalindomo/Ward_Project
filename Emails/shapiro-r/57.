FYI:  I thought SEC's views on the MidAmerican PUHCA language would interest 
you.  At this point, this appears dead....but we are still working it to keep 
it that way.


FROM:  SEC:     Attached is our staff analysis on Senator Kerrey's proposed 
PUCHA
     legislation that you requested.  Please let me know if you need
anything
     else or would like to discuss further.
