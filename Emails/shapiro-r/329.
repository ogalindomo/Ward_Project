I know it's crazy around here, but if you have time to review the attached 
documents (they're short), I would appreciate your comments (especially since 
you've witnessed a focus group before).  They are the messages and focus 
group guide for Tuesday/Wednesday NY research.

I'll be here all day Monday if you want to get me comments by then.  

Thank you.
