Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications=20
industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two year=
s=20

=20
committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly=

respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be=20

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Americas =01) headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group=

led by Stewart Seeligson. =20

perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the=
