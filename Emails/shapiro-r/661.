Enron's Negotiation Position:

As a result of the meeting, the following consensus was reached as to our 
negotiating position with Com Ed:

1.   Negotiate with Com Ed to get what we need in order to do physical deals 
in its service territory.  That translates into negotiating a modified FRP 
agreement.  (The FRP was a one year deal that some marketers signed up for in 
which Com Ed scheduled all the capacity and energy and marketers arranged 
transmission and ancilliaries).  In essence, we want a call option on 
ancilliaries of our choice to cover 2000 MW of power at a price that keeps us 
whole with our existing book of business.  (2000 MW is a negotiable amount 
that represents approximately 10% of Com Ed's peak load).  This would cover 
our existing position (approximately 5 million mwh) as well as allow us to 
grow our business.  The 2000 MW call option would not necessarily be tied to 
existing retail load, leaving us with more flexibility and options.

2.  Under Com Ed's proposal, the PPO would end in 2004, but could end earlier 
for certain large customers paying zero CTC.  In that event, the PPO should 
be replaced with a real time day ahead price into Cinergy.  For Enron's 
customers affected by losing the PPO, we would have the modified FRP 
agreement with the option to put our customers on the bundled rate.  For  
customers who lose the PPO option in the 2002 and 2004 timeframe because of 
the zero CTC, they would not be at risk for having the CTC reinstated.  In 
other words, once the utility moves customers off the PPO, Com ED loses the 
right to come back in and reinstate the CTC for those customers.

Next Steps

1.  Mark Ulrich is reviewing a comparison between the curves, the OATT and 
the the FRP to determine the ancilliary service charge we would be willing to 
pay.

2.  Rogers Herndon is reviewing the Com Ed tariffs on balancing etc.

3.  Once these action items are completed and incorporated into our 
negotiation position, I will call Frank Clark to arrange a meeting.
