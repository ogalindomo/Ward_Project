On the one NE and Southeast orders:

Feel good, guys.  After getting Sarah's call, the traders, including Kevin 
and Dana, said "Awesome" "Great Job" "Way to go" "You've got to feel good", 
plus some whoops for Gov't Affairs!!  Clearly, the most happy yelling I've 
heard about FERC orders in a long time!
