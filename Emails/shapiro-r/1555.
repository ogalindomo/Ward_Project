Rick,

I am sending you the presentation that was circulated in Steve's meeting last 
Monday, by Jim. This was initiated in a California Conference call when news 
about prices going down first came to be known. Alan drew the very first cut, 
but then I had subsequently changed it quite a bit after getting feedback 
from Tom Briggs, Alan, Jim Steffes, paul Kaufman, Linda Robertson and others.

A few slides from this presentation were then used by Steve for his Madrid 
visit. Mark  Palmer circulated only the graphs of prices going down to the 
press, after he attended Steve's meeting.

I thought of updating you on the same

Regards
Ban
