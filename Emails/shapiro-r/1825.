Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late 
yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of 
quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the 
past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the 
Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.
