Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.
