Brendan & I have been in discussion over the last few days, as he was 
concerned that his personal circumstances would prevent him from travelling 
out of Brussels for the next 6 months or so (except very occasionally), and 
about how this would affect his ability to support the Continental Gas 
business as he was hired to do.  Options included :

 (1) Brendan going back to the Commission for a year or two and reapproaching 
Enron after that period and 
 (2) keeping him in Brussels for the interim period and redefining the role 
to focus less on gas and to pick up other EC related work on ecommerce, 
environment, coal, steel etc.

Where Brendan has been involved so far, he has shown valuable knowledge of 
and insight into the Commission's working practices.  Following discussion 
with Eric, our recommendation is to keep Brendan in a Brussels position in 
the interim, rather than risk the possibility that after 1 or 2 years he 
never actually appears.  He should be available to transfer to London on a 
temporary (and perhaps even permanent) basis in early 2002.  Under these 
circumstances, I believe it would make more sense for Brendan to report to 
Peter Styles during this interim period.  Peter will open discussion with 
Brendan to define what he will be doing.  We'll need to consider separately 
how to support the Continental Gas activity, given the hole this creates.
