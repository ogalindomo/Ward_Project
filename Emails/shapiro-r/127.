Attached is the revised travel budget for all your cost centers.  I will send 
the travel budgets to each cost center owner with the budget sheets for 
outside services.

As you know we sent new budget sheets for Harry, Lisa and Sue and sent 
revised budget sheets for your cost center.  I spoke to Amanda Schultz with 
Corporate Accounting a few moments ago and somehow in the process we have 
added $4,000 to the overall budget.  The initial budget number for your cost 
center was 22,358,000.  The new budget number total for you, Harry, Lisa and 
Sue equals $22,362,000.  Amanda indicated that there should be no problem 
with using the $22,362,000 number.  Please advise if you want me to make any 
changes to bring the number down to $22,358,000 for the four cost centers.

Thanks,

Eric
