The attached reflect the comments that I received on today's conference 
call.  (I am awaiting comments from Sarah and Linda.)  Except for filling in 
the cites and a final stylistic readthrough, the draft is essentially final.  
(In light of some of the inserts that I received today, it is possible that 
the draft may be redundant in certain places and may need a little 
wordsmithing.)  Please let me know asap if you have any comments.

I have sent a copy to Constellation Power Source.
