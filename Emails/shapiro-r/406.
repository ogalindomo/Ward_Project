Attached is the third draft of comments to be filed by ENA as a follow-up to 
the March 15 "Dialog" conference.  If you have any comments or concerns, 
please contact me at 713-853-5840 or Leslie Lawner at 713-345-8645 by Friday 
afternoon.  Comments are due to be filed at FERC on Monday, and I would like 
to get them out by FedEx Friday night.
