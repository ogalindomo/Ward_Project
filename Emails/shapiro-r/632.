Dan - The President's Energy plan included the following specific 
recommendations specific to fuel cells:

The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of Energy 
to develop next-generation technology- Focus research and development efforts 
on integrating current programs regarding hydrogen, fuel cells, and 
distributed energy.

The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of the 
Treasury to work with Congress to develop legislation to provide for a 
temporary income tax credit available for the purchase of new hybrid or 
fuel-cell vehicles between 2002 and 2007.

The Administration remains committed to the DOT's fuel-cell-powered transit 
bus program, authored by TEA-21.  This program demonstrates the viability of 
fuel-cell power plants for transit bus applications.

I will update as this moves forward.
