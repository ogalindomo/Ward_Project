Subject: Update on EPMI tariff filing

I called Sarah Novosel to ask her the status of the merger so I could do an 
RCR and make the filing to amend our tariff to allow us to transact with PGE 
commensurate with the consummation of the merger.  Sarah asked that we use 
Adam Wenner (Vinson and Elkins) since he did some of our previous FERC tariff 
filings.  I scheduled a conference call and included AW Turner (because Jay 
was not available), just so we kept PGE in the loop on the importance of 
coordinating the effectiveness of the tariff with that of the merger.  I set 
up a conference call with Sarah and she invited Joe.

Adam agreed to draft a filing for us by May 5th.  Joe told Adam that Sarah 
would be the lead person on this, so she will be submitting any necessary 
RCR.
