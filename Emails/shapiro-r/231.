attached is the budget report as of March 23, 2001 for your review; I'm 
reviewing the SAP reports for each cost center and will let you know if there 
is anything out of the ordinary; there are several cost centers who are over 
budget for the month; I imagine that your cost center will be over budget for 
the month once salaries and wages for the end of the month are included; let 
me know of any questions, comments or concerns
