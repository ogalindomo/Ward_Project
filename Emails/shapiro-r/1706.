Hedy spoke to Senator Burton who informed her that he is deferring to
Senator Sher on the bonding language for the moment, but that Senator Sher
has not agreed to the language which is currently in Legislative Counsel.
If Senator Sher does approve the language, Senator Burton will have the bill
sent through the normal committee process versus sending it right to the
floor.  The bill is not going to refer to a DRC, but instead "will talk
about set-asides."  According to Burton, the language will not be
distributed until Sher approves it.   We will present Enron's proposed
amendments to Sher if he decides to proceed.
