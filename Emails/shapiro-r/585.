Subject: NERC Activities

Dick, Charles, & Andy (the NERC team) --

Can you please work together to have a presentation on NERC matters - 

what we're doing?
what NERC is focused on?
what we don't need to do?
etc?

I would like to have some presentation material and a 1 hour phone call 
hopefully by May 25 (I'm out on holiday May 16 - May 18) to discuss.

I want to make sure that we are fully aligned with the commercial and RTO 
teams.

Jim
