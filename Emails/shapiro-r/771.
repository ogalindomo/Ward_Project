RE: FERC Clarification of Market Mitigation Procedures

On Friday afternoon, the Commission issued an Order clarifying certain 
aspects of its April 26th Order on mitigation measures.  While not addressing 
the rehearing requests or the CAISO compliance filing, the Commission 
established procedures for the CAISO to use alternative information from a 
comparable unit for generators that refuse to provide heat rate and emission 
data to the CAISO.  If an alternative source of data doesn't exist, the CAISO 
can assume the generator is a price-taker and use a bid of $0/MWh for all 
available capacity from that unit.

Second, the Commission rejected the CAISO'a approach to calculating the proxy 
gas price and directed the CAISO to calculate the price using the published 
daily price for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River 
Station), SoCalGas large packages and PG&E large packages.

Third, the Commission rejected the CAISO's decision to apply price mitigation 
only to the Imbalance Energy Market and not to Ancillary Service spot markets 
or Adjustment Bids.

Finally, the Commission granted a request by several California cities to 
require that a creditworthy buyer be in place for all must offer power.

The order is attached.  If you have any questions, contact Julie Simon at
