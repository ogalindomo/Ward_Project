Rick -- As I mentioned earlier, I had the exit interview with Joe Allen last 
week.  I received the following questions from Geriann today, but I think the 
questions are something that you should probably answer.  He currently has 
his contract which he has not yet signed, but I'll remind him I need no later 
than next week in order to pay his lump sum severance.

Please let me know if you'd like for me to work with him on these issues, 
with your guidance:

Joe Allen would like a copy of his contract.    <He still has the two 
originals of his contract>

We need to know who to handle the following expenses:

1. Can he put Austin Club dues on his expense report?

2.  Can he put his parking expenses on his expense report?

3.  Cell Phone?

4.  Subscription to newsletters and magazines?

Thanks, Geriann


Thanks.
Jo Ann
