Ricardo 

Just a note to let you know EECC successfully closed on our sale of ECH 
Offshore shares to Horizon Offshore today and were fully paid our outstanding 
loans, interest, and equity forecasted.  This enables us to exit from the 
pipeline projects on EPC 63 and 64 as planned.  Only CIGSA projects to wrap 
up now.

Thanks again for your assistance in this matter.


Mike
