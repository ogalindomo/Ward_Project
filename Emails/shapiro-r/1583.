This is Dynegy's first draft of a top 10 wishlist to give to the head of the 
Common Carrier Burueau at the FCC.  She specifically requested that the list 
be limited to win-win proposals.  Let's plan to discuss on the 11:00 call.

		 Subject: first draft of FCC top ten list




Attached is my first draft of comments - top ten list of needs to promote
bandwidth trading.  THis has not benn circulated around DYN yet, so there's
nothing official about it yet.  Please look over and let me know your
thoughts.  Steve Augustino provided some of the bullets.  Have a great
weekend.
