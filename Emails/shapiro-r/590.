Please keep this under wraps.  We do not want to circulate this beyond the 
folks listed on this email.  Please let me know any concerns.   As we have 
known for several weeks, the report is not as explicit as we would want, but 
the White House , Vice President, and DOE have repeatedly but verbally 
assured us that they are making clear to FERC (via Pat Wood) exactly what 
this means.

		 Subject: i believe this is the exact language that will appear under the " 
energy supply" section of the report

"Recommends that the President encourage the FERC to use its existing
statutory authority to promote competition and encourage investment in
transmission facilities."
