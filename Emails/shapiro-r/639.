I would drop the "while we have not had an opportunity to review the policy 
in detail.." phrase and simply start "We are..."  I don't think we should 
lead with a qualification.  Otherwise, looks great.

		 Subject: Statement on Bush Policy


Here is the statement we will be using regarding the Bush energy policy 
announcement today.  If any of you have comments on it, let me know.  

Vance Meyer

While we have not had an opportunity to review the policy in detail, we are 
encouraged that it is creating a healthy dialogue about energy solutions in 
the country.

We are not a large generator, so our main interest as a marketer is in moving 
energy from where it is to where it is needed.  Our expectation is that the 
Administration's policy will get the nation focused on how to make that 
happen through more open markets and transmission lines.
