The attached document is something of a quick primer on
Flow Gate versus Locational Marginal Pricing (PJM model).

The first portion is a recent article on the two models
and where the two camps are heading.

The last part is a write up by Randy Berry of ESCA
Marketing on the ESCA outlook.

I've not edited Randy's comments so you can see what are
some of our biases are though ESCA addresses BOTH models
in our RTO/ISO systems.  Bear in mind these are simply one
of our staff members comments, but they at least elucidate
some difficult concepts in a reasonable way.

This seemed like something some of you might want as
background, if it's superfluous to your job, please
delete.  dsg
