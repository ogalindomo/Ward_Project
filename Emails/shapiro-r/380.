		 Subject: Hot-rolled AD and CVD investigations

Attached is a memo with an update on the status of hot-rolled investigations 
currently conducted by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  Preliminary 
determinations have been made in countervailing duty cases.  However, the 
actual duty rates will not be available until April 20, 2001.   Shippers will 
have to start posting cash deposits or bonds in the amount of duties on all 
entries of hot-rolled merchandise from S. Africa, India, Thailand, and 
Indonesia.  Duties on imports from Argentina were established in mid-March.

The memo identifies countries and individual shippers currently under 
investigation.  The regulatory group will provide an update as soon as duty 
rates will become publicly available.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Lisa Yoho or Masha Arefieva.
