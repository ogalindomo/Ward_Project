 The Premier's Office  (Didi Hayward) called  this afternoon to say that what 
she called the  "log jam" with respect to the proposed meeting has finally 
been overcome.   The Premier's Office has proposed the afternoon of  
Thursday, June 7 for 30-45 minutes  to be scheduled between the hours of 2pm 
and  4pm.    In my view, there is still considerable value in proceeding with 
this meeting  and hopefully Ken Lay could be available.   I would suggest 
that we propose the meeting to commence  in the 3:15 - 3:30pm timeframe,  to 
avoid the risk of the Premier being called back into the Legislature in the 
early afternoon and to increase the possibility that, if Lay and Harris are 
getting along, the meeting could run overtime without running into another 
scheduled meeting.  Please let me know how you wish to proceed in contacting 
Ken Lay about his availability, etc.  Regards, Aleck
