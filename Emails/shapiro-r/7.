We were wondering if industrials would need to file "expedited" EWG filings 
in order to take advantage of the ImPower order and the FERC order on Interim 
Reliability measures issued Wed. (see separate email with details of relaxed 
filing requirements for industrials).

Per Dan Watkiss, if an on-site generator is wholly-owned by the parent 
corporation and is not owned by a separate generating company, then there are 
no holding company issues and no EWG filing is needed.  Therefore, this is a 
fact specific issue when we do an on-site generator deal, but in most cases 
EWG filings will not be necessary.
