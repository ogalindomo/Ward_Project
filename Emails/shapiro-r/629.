Just a note to let you know that Jean and I had a nice talk yesterday.  I 
thnik now that the session is almost over, and things are calming down in 
Austin, that she is going to get with Joe and I to discuss the department 
goals and how we can work together more as a team.

She even called Joe yesterday just to talk and also to get his opinion on 
setting up meetings, etc. during the summer.I really think things are on an 
upward trend.

I t\Thought you would be interested in this piece of information .
