I will be away from the office beginning December 13 and returning on
December 26.  I will occasionally be checking my voicemail box.  If you
need more immediate assistance please call Martin Cominsky at
713-627-3490, ext. 122  or email him at Mcominsky@aol.com.

Thank you, and have a great holiday.
