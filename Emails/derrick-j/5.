Subject: RE: SAN ANTONIO MEETING


A few thoughts on topics that might be worthy of discussion at our meeting: -

1. Outside Counsel fees;
2. Recruitment and retention of lawyers and the impact of recent increases in 
salaries elsewhere;
3. Cross calibration of recruits and promotions within the legal department;
4. Communication between the various groups;
5. Are we facing an increased risk of investigation worldwide e.g. FCPA, 
other regualtory issues and are we doing enough to deal with these risks?
6. Technology - as the company becomes more and more e-commerce and 
technologically advanced, is the legal department keeping up e.g. should 
lawyers be more  computer literate, do we need to send them on courses etc?

These are just a few thoughts and please do not hesitate to contact me if you 
would like to discuss any of them or would like some additional ideas.

Thanks very much 
Michael
