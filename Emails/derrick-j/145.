Carrin & Jim --

It was an honor and a pleasure to meet both of you yesterday.  I know we will
have fun working together on this very special event.

Jeff left the jurisprudence luncheon lists for me before he left on vacation.
 I wasn't sure whether he transmitted them to you as well.  Would you please
advise me if you would like them sent to you?  I can email the MS Excel files
or I can fax the hard copies to you.   Please advise what is most convenient.

I plan to be in town through the holidays and can be reached by phone, email,
or cell phone at any time.  My cell phone number is 713/705-4829.

Thanks again for your interest in the ADL's work.  Martin.
