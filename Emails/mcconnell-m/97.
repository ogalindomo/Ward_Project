We had to fill out a self-evaluation as part of the PRC process online.  Is 
that sufficient or would you like more detailed information?

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff
