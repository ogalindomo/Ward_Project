Atached, per your request, are my proposed "top three objectives" for 2001 
for both LNG and Middle East.  Note that I have also listed separately some 
of the other important stuff that we are trying to get done this year.

With regard to LNG, when I look at  what we are trying to get done this year, 
it leads me to conclude that we still have not come to grips with what we 
need to do to really grow this business.  Therefore, I drafted another, more 
broad statement of what I believe we need to be doing to realize our LNG 
vision.  I believe that this is critical and that we have not yet confronted 
the reality as to what we need to be doing.  I am anxious to discuss this 
with you when we meet in London.
