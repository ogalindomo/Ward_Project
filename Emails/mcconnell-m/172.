Just a reminder of what we discussed regarding the fate of the Singapore 
office. The trader I mentioned was Pat Markey and he moved there about a year 
ago. He has done a great job on EOL and should be able to give you a good 
overview of the Singapore office both pro and con and how it could be 
improved.
