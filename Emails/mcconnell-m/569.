I would suggest we avoid getting involved in any acquisition effort at 
present, although it would be worth establishing avaluation for the storage 
and the brand.  All our experience so far with Spanish law suggests due 
diligence shouldn't be undertaken unless we are serious, and that it  will be 
impossible to transact in less than  3 months if that.
