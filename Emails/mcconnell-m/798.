Congratulations we have located on your behalf Roy Lichtenstein's 'Blue Note: 
Composition #4'.? If you are serious about the artwork we will need a 
commitment from you to acquire the piece for you. 

Please contact me as soon as possible since this is a time sensitive matter.? 
I will be in the gallery late this evening till 9pm PST and from 
9:30am-6:00pm PST Tues. through Fri. 

Have you received the package on the Matisse?? What do you think about the
