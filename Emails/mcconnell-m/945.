Joe,  of course, I'll ask Cathy to set up a time for a call.  I hope all is 
well.  Things are crazy here,  crazy but great.

With all of your new responsibilities, is it possible we could set  a time to 
catch up.  As I mentioned in the voice mail... is this new org change 
responsible for the recent stock price runup?? :)
