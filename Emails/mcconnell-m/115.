I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or 
Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high 
stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to 
those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member 
of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our 
offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have 
effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have 
the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, 
when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful 
assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our 
efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have 
any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact 
Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy
