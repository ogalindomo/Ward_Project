Mike, 

Attached for your review and comment is the preparation memo we have prepared 
for the referenced phone call.  The actual call will probably need to be 
delayed somewhat since President Chavez will be traveling for the next 2-3 
weeks in SE Asia and then Russia.

If you have any comments or questions about the memo, please call me at 
X-52709 or Guido Caranti at X-52707.

Neal
