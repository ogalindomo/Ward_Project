I apologise for the delay in sending you the brief that I had promised when 
we last spoke.I was waiting on Sanjay to approve the final draft of the 
presentation that we were to make to RAC. He has been travelling - so please 
consider the enclosure as WIP. I will forward the final version as soon as it 
is ready in the next few days.

I'd like to thank you for your support  during the recent interview process 
and assure you that you can count on me to deliver the results expected of 
the Communications team

I expect to be in Houston in the week of 10th July and look forward to 
meeting with you .
