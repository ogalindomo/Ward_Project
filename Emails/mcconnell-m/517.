Subject: Unit Outage Insurance

Although I was unable to attend last Monday's meeting re: the Unit Outage 
Insurance product, I understand our guys feel the product has a lot of merit 
and they're in the process of rolling it out to select customers over the 
next few weeks. I'll be interested to see what we can make of it. Thanks for 
the time you spent with the group and stay in touch with our guys!

Thanks again!
