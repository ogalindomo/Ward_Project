ref previous talks, my 2 cts on this new development :

1/ we should keep the old gasoil issue - which still carry balance due of abt 
7 million -, separated from the new gasoline factor which is a new business 
to analyze on its own merits.
2/GM will not be able to repay the 7 million within december, if we don t 
take an alternative view by deliveries directly to all customers, not 
obliging GM to prepay all. They cannot do both (ref my mail nov 21st).
3/Due to lack of GM commercial person, it may help that you contact Miguel 
Medina and take him as consultant (maybe be unofficially)
so that you have an  ex insider view.
Thanks
Michel
