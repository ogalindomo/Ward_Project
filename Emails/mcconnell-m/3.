		 Subject: THE GARTMAN LETTER; THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 2001



We erred in covering our short position in the euro  yesterday simply because 
the President erred in promoting protectionist steel  legislation.? The euro 
has more bearish fundamentals going for it than even  this bit of "bullish" 
news, and we are therefore returning as sellers of the  euro this morning.
