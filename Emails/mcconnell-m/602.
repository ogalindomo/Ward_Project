Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail. To reply to your queries:
Meier Graefe was the name of the man who directed the print publishing
business of Pan in the 1890's. 'Pan' was the name under which the business
issued a literary and arts magazine in Berlin, but with a special focus on
French art. Pan issued sets of lithographs and etchings, mostly specially
commissioned from the artists and drawn especially for Pan, as in the case
of the Cross and Signac, to accompany the the text of the magazine. These
prints are referred to as the Pan 'album'.

The Signac is from the regular edition of the Pan album, and as such is not
numbered. Only the de-luxe edition was numbered (see Cross). Neither Signac
nor Cross are signed in the stone. Both are very well known and fully
documented works by the artists.

I will look forward to hearing further from you.

William Weston.
