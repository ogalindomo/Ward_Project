Mike:

I have attached a slightly revised version - I apologize for the delay - but 
have been very active with the market and interviews - The only number I have 
a question with is the 65% in the last paragraph - Where did this originate? 
All changes that I made - I have typed in bold. Please call with questions -


Thanks
