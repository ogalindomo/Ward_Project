I have attached the interview schedule/evaluation form and resume for the 
exploratory interview on Tuesday, June 12, 2001 with Faye Worthy. Please let 
me know if  any conflicts arise in scheduling as the candidate is traveling 
from Columbus, Ohio on Monday, June 11, 2001.

A hard copy of Faye's resume will be delivered to your offices on Friday,

Thank you,
