Subject: Dallas Bound/A Contact at Enron Venture Cap?


Tell Chris that we are heading up to see the SMU ponies in their new
stadium!!  Know you are busy, but have been trying to find out the contact
person in your new business unit.  Just completed two more assignments for
dot.coms, and have two others on the crest of huge developments.  Any help
would be appreciate, as we might be able to explore some mutual business
opportunities.  Thanks..
