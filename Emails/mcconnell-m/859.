Dear all, 
Please remember, each Business Unit  (BU) will be responsible for generating 
their own distribution list based on the Business Objects report that will be 
put into the HR repository tomorrow.    Please let Kathy Schultea and myself 
know  immediately  the name of your one point of contact for each BU and/or 
function.  Kathy Schultea will notify them when the report has been put into 
the repository. You should begin validating your participant list on Monday 
September 11th. 

Kathy  or a member of her staff wil be available should you need assistance 
in generating your individual reports.   I can be reached at 31477 should you 
have questions.

Subject: The Pulse - Distribution List Schedule

As you know, Andrea Yowman will be coordinating the distribution lists for 
the Pulse survey in October.  Attached is the most up to date schedule that 
she has generated as a basis for working on those lists.  I am suggesting she 
send the lists to the HR head for each group so that you can decide whom you 
want to review and approve them.


As mentioned in my earlier email to you, please contact Andrea directly with 
any questions you may have about the lists including how to separate out 
those who will receive paper and pencil, how to handle those not on 
electronic distribution systems, etc.

            Dick Amabile
