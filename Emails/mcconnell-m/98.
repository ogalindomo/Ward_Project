Mike:

 Hope you had a safe trip home.  During the reception when you and Mark were 
here, I talked about the need for an additonal senior Enron guy with project 
development experience and said I was talking with two internal candidates at 
the time.   Both have fizzled out.  I seem to recall you mentioned Rick might 
be available/interested if we could get over his possible title and reporting 
concerns (Senior VP and Management Committee Member at E-Power reporting to 
our Japanese president, Mr. Seguchi).  If you think this is an option, I 
would appreciate if you would mention the role to him and ask him to give me 
a call or send me an e-mail and I will follow-up.

Thanks, Carey
