Greg, 

Yes, I am their guy.  I have extensive info and feedback forms on them.  We 
definitely need to talk.  Please set up a 30 minute meeting with Cathy 36898 
and we can go through it and i;ll give you a copy of all info.

Thanks,
mike

PS congrats on ClickPaper.  The site looks great, you and your group 
accomplished a lot in a short period of time.  I know that the big test day 
was yesterday and hope all went well.

Are you the PRC rep for these guys?  If so, can I get some feedback on them 
so I can speak for them at the Global VP PRC on July 31st?

Thanks.
