Mike,
? You will probably receive a call from the  top JDRF Legislative Volunteer, 
Leah Mullin. Her husband, Leo Mullin, is CEO of  Delta Airlines and they have 
a diabetic son. They are also very friendly with  the Brennemans.
? Leah would like to enlist the help of  yourself and any Enron 
powers-that-be for support from Dick Cheney for stem cell  funding.
? As you know, from our many mailouts, this is  a hot topic! We are very 
afraid that Pres Bush and VP Cheney might ban stem cell  research, thus 
negating all chances of our cure for diabetes.
? I hope that you can help Leah when she  calls. I have sung your praises to 
her (and just about everyone from Washington  to Timbucktu). Thanks, Mike.
Kathy
