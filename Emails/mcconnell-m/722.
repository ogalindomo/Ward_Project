Bob, I don't want to wait for Mike, please set up the meeting without him.  
He can join us by phone if needed.
Thanks,

Mike, Mike Brown is on vacation next week and I understand you are in Asia 
the following week.  I have eye surgery the first week of November.  Is the 
second week of November early enough for your briefing or should we try to 
set something up by telephone?
