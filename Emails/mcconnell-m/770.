Dear Mike:

How is Tokyo?  Events look serious in the Middle East right now.  Where are
you heading to next?

The weather here has been lovely.  When do you think you and your wife will
next be in San Francisco?

Please let me know how you would like to proceed on the Lichtenstein artwork
'Blue Note.'  We have located the work on your behalf but cannot proceed until
we have a serious commitment from you.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky
