This memo is from Doug Arnell:

Please find attached our latest draft of the planned intervention in El Pao's 
application re. Elba Island.

Shelley Corman has reviewed the draft and aside from minor language comments 
has no problem with it.  Shelley will be speaking with Stan Horton this 
morning to see if he has an issue.  I will also follow up with Stan.

I will  also  be previewing the intervention with El Paso's FERC people prior 
to submitting to FERC.

Please call if you wish to discuss (x56249)

Thank you
