Jim, I think it does.  I am usually unable to attend so I would really like 
you to stick with this as our rep.  Also we will talk about the best uses of 
your time after this weeks budget meetings.  I'll give you a call.
Thanks,
Mike

Mike, I have been the CALME rep on this task force. Given that CALME no 
longer exists and that you are already there to represent EGM, do you think 
that it makes sense for me to continue to attend these monthly meetings?

Jim
