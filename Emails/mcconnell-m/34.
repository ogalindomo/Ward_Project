Hi Mike,

I just wanted to follow up with you after my meeting with Larry 
Lawyer.  Larry was positive about the product and business
opportunity I developed for the broadband space.  However, 
he also feels that the general business template I presented 
can be readily covered by his current team.  

I am still open to meeting with other members of your team, 
since some of your groups may like to have some people with 
structured finance and origination capabilities work a little 
more closely with them.  I'll follow your suggestion.  Thanks
again for your time.

Mathis.
