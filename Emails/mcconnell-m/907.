Gary,
FYI and consideration, Billy Lemmons called me on this guy.  It sounds like 
we should talk to him.

Mike,

Attached is the resume I mentioned to you yesterday on voice mail.  I can 
personally speak for Dave as an outstanding performer.  I am looking forward 
to getting together with you in the next week or two.

Take care,
Billy
