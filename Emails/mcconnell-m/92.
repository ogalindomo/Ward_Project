Attached please find a first draft for your Executive Letter for the 
newsletter. I'm sorry that it is so sketchy. EGM is doing so much and I'm not 
sure what you want to focus on right now!  I am afraid if I keep going, I 
will be way over the word count for our space allotment. Right now, there are 
404 words. Please fill in where it is pertinent and monitor word count to 550.

Again, I'm sorry to impose on you with this.
