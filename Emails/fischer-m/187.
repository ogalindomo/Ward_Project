Mark,

I am guessing that he wants Stat Dat files for March and April for each 
turbine.  Kurt is going to come by in the morning and explain further.

John - Please prepare a CD with the stat dat files for March and April at 
Dessert Sky (aka Clear Sky aka Indian Mesa) for each of the turbines.

If anyone has any other thoughts on what this might mean please pipe up.
