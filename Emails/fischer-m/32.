Ron,

The training department has already provided recommended changes and 
additions to Joe. If you do not have a copy, let me know and we will send 
them to you. I think the number one issue is what do our customers want. If 
we can make VisuPro provide our customers with all of the data they need in a 
user friendly format, we will have an excellent software program. Be sure and 
review the comments that Gary Vercleeren sent to Kevin.

Ed, 

I don't know if you've seen this, but I though you could provide some useful 
feedback.

Subject: SCADA Requirements

We are meeting with the German and Spanish representatives at the end of 
March to discuss short term and long term SCADA objectives.

1)
Please provide me with known issues we need to improve the current VisuPro

2)
Provide me with longer term (next 3 - 5 years) requirements/wish list to 
include in a completely optimized SCADA system.

I'd like input by March 18.
Contact me if additional information or explanation required.

Thank you

Ron
