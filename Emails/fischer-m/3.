Splus 2000 r3.

I have fit a 2-parameter Weibull distribution to a data vector (fire-free
intervals in forests) and would like to compute the probability that the
shape parameter is greater than 1.  I can use bootstrap() [I presume] to
compute the standard error.  Is there a closed expression for CIs? (I
imagine a normal approximation would be pretty lame here).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
