I have been inundated with e-mail regarding loading software for printers, 
palm pilots, and minor applications necessary for normal course of business.  
You may load these types of applications, however, you must realize the 
following:

The user must maintain copies of any required licenses and realize we do not 
provide help desk services on
non standard software.  It is also important to note that if in the process 
of installing non standard software, 
the users standard core software becomes corrupt, the service level 
agreements from the help desk are null
and void and we can only commit to best effort for resolution.

If you are in doubt about the software you want to install, send me an e-mail 
with the specifics and I'll get back to you.  Please bear in mind that you 
may not get a 
resolution until next week as we are right in the middle of IT integration.

Thanks.
