Hi Rabi,

I am developing a StatServer Analytic, but it keeps timing out (at about 300 
seconds/5 minutes). In the page I am using I have tried increasing the time 
but it has no effect, so could you find out if there is a setting on the 
server (IIS script timeout) and see about increasing the value?
