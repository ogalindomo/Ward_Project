Mark:

Could you please analyze the data the transfer server in in the directory 
Phillip_G/For_MarkFisher.  You have done the same type of analysis before and 
I have added an example of the output you provided before in the spreadsheet.

All I need is the mean value for the nacelle wind speed, free-stream wind 
speed, and ratio of these two wind speeds for 0.5 m/s bins.

It would be great to get this by 11am tomorrow.

Thanks for your help,

Philippe
