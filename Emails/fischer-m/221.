Subject: "Vestas Availability"

Here is the latest version. It only uses periods past the 90 day ramp up and 
removes leaning turbines. I have made one other change to the code. I 
discovered one case where the survey time was over 3000 hours, so I added 
code to remove all cases where the ST was greater than 1.10*Actual Survey. I 
have added a paragraph explaining these qualifiers.
