As per our phone conversation, please generate these two bin-averaged power 
curves for turbine #2 at Montfort. 

1) Consider all data from the month of February
2) Consider data only from Feb. 9 to the end of February

Please use 0.5 m/s bins.

The prefered output for this work is a single plot showing both power curves.

Getting these results by the end of this week would be perfect.

Thanks,

Philippe
