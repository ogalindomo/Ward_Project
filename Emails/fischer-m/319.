Ladies and Gentlemen,

Many of you have received the Six Sigma Green Belt Training CD.  If you have 
not, contact your supervisor or Jeri Fish to obtain a copy.
All salaried GE Wind Energy employees are required to qualify as a "Green 
Belt", and others are invited to participate in this program as well. It is 
my understanding that we each will be required to perform one Six Sigma 
project during our first year as GE Wind Energy employees.  We will be 
measured to some extent by our Six Sigma project participation and successful 
implementation of the methods presented in the CD-ROM.  Annual performance 
evaluation, advancement in the organization, and salary level are all 
influenced by our Six Sigma related performance.    

You recently heard Nicoa Dunne announce that GE Wind Energy had accomplished 
the integration process in shorter time than any other GE acquisition.  Our 
leadership group is proud of that achievement and has raised the bar by 
putting out the challenge to have all GE Wind Energy salaried personnel 
become Green belts in a shorter time than any other GE business unit.  I am 
asking you to do your part as a member of the Services team by successfully 
completing the study requirements and tests given in the CD for Green Belt 
qualification before July 15, 2002.  You may use time during work to study 
the material and take the test.  

Please see me to pick up your personal copy of the CD-ROM so that you can get 
started.  Following your completion of the CDROM study requirements, there 
will be a 3-day Green Belt 6-Sigma Training class for all parties that have 
participated.
