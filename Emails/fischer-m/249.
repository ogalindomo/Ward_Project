Stan,

I spoke to Alaadin when he was on his way to lunch, earlier today,
regarding the content of Section 3 of the Final SCADA Acceptance Test
Results report. My question should probably been addressed to you.

The question is: why are the screen dumps presented taken from records
of April 19, deviant from the data that Alaadin and I witnessed on April
18, as recorded on the typescript sheet 'Met-Mast Data record during
SCADA final ATP' that is included in this section of the report?

[The latter is correct, with the exception of a typo in the wind speed
data for turbine 31: this should read 11.6, not 1.6.]

The content of the three tables in Section 1, under the heading of Test
7.0 is erroneous:

a) the date should be April 18 and the times should correspond with the
records on the typescript sheet;

b) a number of wind speed and temperature values do not correspond with
those on the typescript sheet. This appears to result from an effort to
correlate data from April 19, as it appears on the screen dumps, with
data recorded on April 18.


I have some comments on the text preceding the tables.  I shall write
separately regarding that.


Peter.
