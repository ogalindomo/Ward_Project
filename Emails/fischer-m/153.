Hi Mark,

As per our discussion, I need linear regression results (equation and R2), 
and I'm interested in these two cases:
1) No binning of the data
2) Binning of the data using 0.5 m/s bins as done previously, in which case 
the linear correlation I need is that on the bin average for the nacelle 
(free-stream) and nacelle wind speeds

As a starting point, please use the spreadsheet on the transfer directory:

If at all possible, results before 4pm today would be great.  Sorry for the 
last minute notice.
