Guys,

In an earlier e-mail Ben made the statement:  "Have you been able to 
determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode." 

We now need to develop a methodology to calculate the Vestas definition using 
VisuPro data.  I think this boils down to:

Vestas Avail = (SOT+WOT+EST+RT+MT)/(ST-LOT)

Where:

SOT = System Okay Time
EST = External Stop Time
WOT = Weather Out Time
LOT = Line Out Time
DT = Down Time
RT = Repair Time
MT = Maintenance Time

ST = SOT+EST+WOT+LOT+DT+RT+MT

This calculation is based on an operating assumption that the current day 
machines are placed into "pause" mode during maintenance and repair time.  As 
a result the availability counters will continue to increment even when the 
turbine is being serviced.  

Let's get together and discuss,
Hollis
