This file contains a summary of the weekly mechanical availability numbers, 
as well as, the contractual availability number received from Asset Mgmt 
(Barry Riffe). It seems that in many cases, the contractual is lower than the 
mechanical.  

In this set of attached data, I am trying to state the monthly domestic fleet 
availability by category (e.g. ramp-up month 1 and warranted month 1, etc).  
As the availabilty numbers are difficult to predict without having it done 
individually by turbine, I am currently taking the document you provided 
(Hollis) and will recalc what is in the attached chart, thus being more 
accurate.  However, the doc. you provided (commissioning summary) only has 
Nov-Feb.  Do we have the data prior to Nov available?  If there is a better 
method, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ilan
