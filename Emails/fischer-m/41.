Joe,
It seems when I exit out of VisuPro I get the "Illegal Operation" message box 
. In the details it states that
"VisuPro caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> 0000:015clac9"

Although I am able to FTP files and do other commands in VisuPro, should the 
program be reinstalled?

Thanks
John
