The attached Powerpoint slide file gives the high level overview of the Six 
Sigma program as it will be applied at GEWE.   The comments I'll give you 
this afternoon are in addition to these slides.  The slides were created to 
support a Six Sigma expert (Blackbelt) briefing.  There are a few acronyms in 
the slides that aren't explained.  Tomorrow I''ll send you a list of what the 
unexplained acronyms mean.
