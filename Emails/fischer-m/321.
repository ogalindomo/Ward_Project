Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?
