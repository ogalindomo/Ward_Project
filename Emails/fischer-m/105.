Additional information:   For the next week the 1.5 project priorities for 
the System Performance Group are:
1)  Load up most recent  Mon files for April at site indicated in attached 
spreadsheet.
2)  Load backlogged minana and statdat files for Clear Sky and Trent in order 
to close gaps.   A customer wants us to conduct an analysis in the near 
future with this data.   Mark Fisher says that he gave you graphs which 
highlights gaps in the STAR 10 min data.   Is that adequate?
3)  All other data.
