The attached PDF file contains the latest 1.5 Faults and the Timers which are 
initiated.
If there is a "- - - -" in the 1.5 column, the Fault is not used.

Klaus,
I need to know which Timer is started for each of the following Fault/Status 
messages, for example, Downtime, Weather Out, Line out, External Stop, etc.
This information is not in the older version of the VisuPro manual.

Thank you.
Ron
