Hello Jeff,

I sent a new pressure transducer to the folks in Montfort and they installed 
it last week. The pressure data should be accurate now.

Garth,
I installed the pressure transducer on the 8th, everything seems fine. What 
would you like me to do with the bad tranducer? I appreciate the help.
Dave
