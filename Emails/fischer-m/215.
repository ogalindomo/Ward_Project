Subject: March Clear Sky Curtailment

Kurt,

The spreadsheet we discussed for March is attached. Having rerun the numbers 
I found a typo on the email that was sent out before. The billable 
curtailment should have been 10,737,017  not 10,737,107. This also affected 
the Curtailed production.Taking this typo into account the values in the 
spreadsheet agree with the values previously provided. The spreadsheet is 
still in the order that the site provided, not time or turbine sorted. In 
addition I haven't done any formatting, so number of decimals varies. Lastly 
the times in this sheet, unlike the sheet from the site, are in UTC like 
SCADA (VisuPro).

Mark
