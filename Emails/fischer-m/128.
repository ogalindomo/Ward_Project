Ilan,

The first thing to jump out at me is the 36 hour per year limit on MT.  
Currently our standard is 48 hours per year and this may be aggressive.  We 
can check into this some more but be aware that with this definition we just 
lost 25% of our maintenance time.

Subject: Proposed Clipper Availability

Mark(s) - 

Please review the attached calculation which Clipper proposes for 
Availability.  I will compare it with the contractual availability which have 
recently proposed, but would prefer your input.

Thanks,
Ilan

Can you please give this a quick read to see if this my work.  This is a take 
on our standard availability that Clipper is proposing.  Let me know your 
thoughts.
