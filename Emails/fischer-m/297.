Kurt,
 As requested here is a brief overview of the discussion between Mark Fisher 
, myself and Gary Verklereen that took place on 6/13/02 & 6/14/02 regarding 
availability on the Millrun & Somerset sites. Mark did a great job of 
demonstrating the usefulness of the Mon.db file to Gary for the purpose of 
calculating availability, and also the method used by GE wind to determine 
availability. By the end of the second day Gary expressed he had a new found 
confidence in the accuracy of the Mon.db file data and also in general agreed 
with the method GE Wind used to calculate availability. Gary did  express a 
few concerns which are listed below. 

Gary was concerned that we may continue to overlook the fact the turbine may 
have been put into virtual mode. Mark reassured Gary that new measures were 
being taken to prevent this situation from being overlooked in the future and 
during the recalculation of the availability.

Gary also expressed that he could see no problem with the 4 hours of 
maintenance time that was being added each month as long as, in the monthly 
report the  actual availability is list in a sperate column as the adjusted 
availability.

Gary felt that in the recalculation of the availability it may be warranted 
to count the many breaker operations that occurred in the first few months of 
the project as downtime rather then Line Out Hours as they may have been 
counted. This was due to the fact that we made a adjustment to the breaker 
that later prevented it from tripping as often. This suggested to Gary that 
the breaker trips were in fact due to improper settings.

Another suggestion by Gary was that after a fault, the turbine could take as 
long as 1 to 2 minutes to began producing as the turbine performed its run up 
sequence. Gary suggested that during the winter months when the turbines 
experienced hundreds of Low Gearbox Oil Pressure faults, that this 1 to 2 
minute run up sequence would equate to several hundred minutes were the 
turbine reported available, but was not truly available to produce. He 
concluded that in the recalculation we may want to count this time as 
downtime.

When asked what method could be agreed upon during the recalculation, Gary 
stated that after reviewing the method we used he could see no problem with 
it as long as we did not overlook things like the virtual mode. Gary also 
stated that as long as the final availability was within 1% of his 
calculations he would have no complaints. If the final availability numbers 
were greater then 1% of his calculations then he would need a break down of 
what was counted and what was not counted for review.
