Do we have the support for this information by turbine?  If so, it would be 
useful for my analysis.

Thanks,

Ilan,

Here are the Monthly operational reports that include 1.5 information (they 
have been included since Jan 2002). March is not yet ready, your name will be 
added to the distribution list.
