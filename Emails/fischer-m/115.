Kurt, 
You asked for the availability of Clear Sky by 11 am.   The attached file 
provides this and will form the final Onwer Report when the Manual Logs are 
fully integrated into the file.   The production is 10% lower than the 
substation meter reading.  I have applied all of the corrections I can 
through Visupro data.   

George,
Are the manual reads you sent in based on Visupro screen data?  Or readings 
from the controller interface at the turbine?
