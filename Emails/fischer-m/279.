Matthew,

Our new cost center is cc 269.  This was effective at the beginning of the 
year.

Regards,
Hollis

Subject: Cost Center?



Greetings,

To my best memory, the Systems Performance Group is cost center 267.  I 
picked up my American Funds retirement packet tonight from the front desk, 
and the sticker on the front states cost center 269.  Have we changed cost 
centers or is this a typo?
