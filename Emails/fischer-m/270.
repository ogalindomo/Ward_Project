I haven't looked at the latest stuff that you have sent because I've had a 
problem connecting by remote. I'll be in the office on Friday and will be in 
touch with you. Do you intend to provide data from May also? I believe that 
this will be very interesting due to higher ambient temperatures. Please 
advise if that is possible. Thanks.

Kind Regards,

Tom
