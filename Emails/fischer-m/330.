Ward,

We currently re-running the May figures with the updated wind speed 
correction and will forward the May summary with the Jan and Feb figures from 
Rich.  The question should we update the Mar and April figures using the 
updated wind speed correction, or present those figures as a conservative 
figure.

If we re-run them it will take most of the day, and we may have them for the 
morning meeting.

Please let Kurt know and we'll work on this.  I'll try to call when I arrive 
in TX today.

Kurt, let Mark Fisher know if we need to proceed on this.

Jeff Duff

Terri,

Do you have a copy of the curtailment numbers that you can send to me, so I
may begin looking over them before our meeting on Tuesday? ?I think this
would allow for more imput from CPS regarding the calculation of these
numbers and future curtailment numbers.
