Ron,

Garth did a good job on answering some of the questions about which counters 
were used for different situations. But there are still a lot of holes. We 
need to know all of the answers regarding the counters in the VisuPro 
program. The owners also need this information. During your talks with the 
programmers, ask if they have this information.

Thanks
Ed
