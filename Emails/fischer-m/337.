Please be advised.  The VisuPro download to cd for June SCADA data should be 
done on Monday, July 1 and sent to Tehachapi as "Next Day Delivery." 

The files needed for monthly reporting are similar to the Wednesday download 
including Zmet if available.
Please include the Mon0207.db file if it is available.

Please call me or email if there are any questions.
Thank you
