Mark - 

Thanks for the Monthly Reports.  Do we have the same report for the 1.5s 
through 2001?  Is this the report you referred to last week that was going to 
be revised, and that you only were going back to Jan. 2002 at this point?  If 
that is the case, how should I go about summarizing EA availability, ramp-up, 
etc for 2001?

Thanks again,
Ilan
