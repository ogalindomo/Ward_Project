Mark F,

Please see the attached work request.  With owner reporting upcoming, you 
will have more time for this request.  One issue I saw was estimating the 
lost production during the fault events, but I'll let you discuss this with 
Tom if it will be an issue.  Maybe the new field in the Faults table might 
help?  If so, let me know and I'll push for this do get done.
