Subject: Visupro's curtailment log

I have attached the curtailment log that Visupro creates.  This file is 
stored at the turbine and not on the park computer.
Let me know if this is what you needed.

The curtailment program creates an additional log that is stored on the 
computer that the curtailment program is running on.
