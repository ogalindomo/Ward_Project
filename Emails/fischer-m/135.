Hollis - 

Per our last phone call, I made the changes (in red) to the Clipper 
Availability to suite what I believe is a good definition for us 
(incorporates Mark(s) comments which I added).  Please review and comment so 
I can send this file on to Mark Eilers.  Please view this document in a 
Commercial light as spoke, thus looking at what favors EWC.  Please call to 
discuss.

Thanks,
Ilan

PS - Dave Schulgen put together a chart which outlines EWC maintenance costs 
per year for 1.5 maintenance.  His work indicates that 72 hours (rather than 
36/48) should be the standard (with an increase in the later years for 
additional work).  This is reflected in the attachment.
