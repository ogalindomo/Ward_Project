Hi Mark, 

Thanks for the data, but I'am missing the timestamp information in both 
XLS-files. Can you support me also (if possible today) with this timestamp 
information?

Klaus

Klaus,

The 10-minute data for both sites is in the zipped file attached below. The 
starting times are either end of last year of the beginning of this year. In 
addition there are some gaps in the data. I hope that this will provide what 
you need.
