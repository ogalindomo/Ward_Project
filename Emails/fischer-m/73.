Mark,

We may get a comment on the page 1 footnote 1 regarding "information not 
being available".  Did you check with Engineering SCADA for this information?

If you did then please put a note to that effect and send it on to Jeff 
Ghilardi.

Thanks,
Hollis

Here is the draft of the report for Jeff Ghilardi. After removing Oct 2001, 
the correlations went down (in magnitude, they remained negative), though one 
was statistically significant.
