Attached is a summary report showing the following data fields for the faults 
table. (Fault Number, Include,Fault Description)  I've cross referenced this 
with the spread sheet Kim provide.  

0 - Considered Status Message (SOT increments)
1- Considered Fault (LOT,DT,MT,RT,EST,and WOT increment)

If there are any comments please let me know.
