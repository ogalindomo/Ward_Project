Please fill out the attached form to ensure that all applications required by 
you are installed on your machine when it is coreloaded with GE software.  
Note that some of these applications will require that you leave the software 
for IT at your workstation the evening or weekend that your machine is 
scheduled to be loaded.  These applications are underlined on the list.  If 
the software is not left for us, we can not load it, due to software 
licensing issues.  Additionally, there are a few specialty applications that 
you will be expected to load on your own.  These applications are italicized 
on the list.  We do, however, request that you check the box next to them as 
we need to keep track of licensing.

Please submit one copy of the completed form to Leonard Ruiz via interoffice 
mail.  Please tape a copy of the completed form to the side of your computer 
monitor.  This is necessary as the machine name does not always match the 
user name.

An installation schedule will be distributed shortly.  We must have this form 
before we load your PC.  

I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that any data that you 
leave on your local hard drive will be erased when we coreload your machine.  
Don't forget to move all data you wish to save up to the network.

Thank you for your cooperation.
