Jeff,

Do you know how often we need to download the Z-Met data?  In other words, 
what are the file characteristics?  Do they overwrite every 3.4 days, are 
they a data stack which has 1000 records, etc.

Thanks,
Hollis

Subject: Modification to down load VisuPro Z-Met data

Kelly,

We need to prepare an SUB to change the downloading requirement for the 
VisuPro data.  Specifically we need to include the Z-Met data (file and 
frequency) as well as a uniform methodology for file management.

Can we meet in the morning sometime to discuss?

Thanks,
Hollis
