Subject: Moving data files from Desert Sky (Clear Sky/Indian Mesa)

John,

Terrie Smith is trying to move data from the site to the transfer directory. 
This is taking an enormous amount of time (Almost 24 hours to move the files 
for 107 folders of data). Is there a better method to make the transfer? How 
can we get the data transfered quickly from that site to here?
