Bo and Klaus, Ward Marshall is now asking for January data at Clear Sky. If 
you recall, Mark Fisher and Matthew Meyers put together the wind and turbine 
performance data for Feb. and we sent that to Ward last week. There are going 
to be a couple of issues with providing this data for Jan.
The data collection for the turbines was less reliable in January.
The wind data should be OK, Matthew?
The curtailment data is going to be sorely lacking, during the month of 
January we were only tracking the time and I believe the number of turbines 
off-line during curtailments, not the specific wtg's off-line due to 
curtailment. This going to make the actual lost energy calculation much more 
difficult and open to question.

Mark and Matthew are going to get started on this asap, I would suggest that 
Bo, Klaus and myself discuss this issue on Friday AM.
