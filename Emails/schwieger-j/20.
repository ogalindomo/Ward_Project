Hey Jim,

How's it going?  It's that time of year again.  Please don't forget me should 
you have any leftover rodeo tickets.  I will be forever greatful as with all 
the other times.  I see one that I am particularly interested in (Def 
Leppard).  I'd like to get four for that one if you happen to come across 
any.  Sorry to be such a bug already.  I feel bad asking since I'm not part 
of the group anymore.  Well, let me know if you should have any leftovers 
that you just can't seem to get rid of at the last minute.  Thanks bud!  
Sorry to write only when I want something.

-Brenda
