Jim,

Westpark was declined by our credit group for on-line trading access.  Here 
are there comments:  Credit declined 3/1; weak financials and company is a 
1-man shop.  All OTC trades are heavily collateralized; we will not transfer 
to on-line activity.  The credit contact is Walter Guidroz if you want to 
talk to him, or you may want to let Patrick know that he will be getting a 
rejection letter.  We can give him a long term guest id (read only) if you 
would like.  We don't usually do this, but if a trader requests it and has a 
legitimate business reason, we can do it.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.
