Subject: Interconnect Reimbursement Language

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both 
interconnects to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the 
language requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational 
circumstances constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still 
needed.  In this way both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both 
the receipt and delivery interconnects function as intended.  Please let me 
know if you disagree.
