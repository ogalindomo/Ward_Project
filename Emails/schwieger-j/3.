    I thought all you non-Floridians might like to see the new crop
    of bumper stickers floating around Florida these days ...
    from those who put the "DUH" in "Floriduh"!


    FLORIDA: If you think we can't vote, wait till you see us drive.

    FLORIDA: We count more than you do.

    FLORIDA: If you don't like the way we count then take I-95 and
    visit one of  the other 56 states.

    FLORIDA: We've been Gored by the bull of politics and we're
    Bushed.

    FLORIDA: Relax, Retire, Revote.

    FLORIDA: Where your vote counts and counts and counts.

    FLORIDA: This is what you get for taking Elian away from us!

    FLORIDA: We're number one! Wait! Recount!

    Palm Beach County:  If you're nice, we'll let you vote twice.

    Palm Beach County: We put the "duh" in Florida.

    Sign on I-95 : Florida this way 2 miles , no, that way  5 miles,
    no, wait 10...

    Pro-electorate's choice: Abort the pregnant chads.

    We, the people,  have spoken. Now shut up and listen while the
         lawyers tell us what we said.

    FLORIDA: We can't vote, but you should see us handle 15 bingo
    cards!
