Gentlemen,

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.
