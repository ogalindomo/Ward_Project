As you are aware, the Trading Floor adopted three families for the holiday 
season.  Thanks to your support all three families will have a better holiday 
than they would have without your help.  You have been more than generous!

We have one family (single mom with four children) who has a boy who's 
birthday is tomorrow.  We would like to make sure this 12 year old boy gets a 
birthday gift.  If you would like to help us with this, we are asking 
everyone to pitch-in a dollar or two.  Please forward your money to Theresa 
Villeggiante or Grace Rodriguez.

Thanks!

Mollie
