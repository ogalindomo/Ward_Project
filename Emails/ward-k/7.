Kim, thanks for the phone message last week. We are excited to have you back
in Houston. Can't wait to "pop in" on you Sunday evenings with a bottle of
bubbly or fine wine...

Got your Christmas e-mail. Could you tell us the address to send the check?
Thanks.

Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving.

Mike
