Ahoy, 
?
We already have 11 people confirmed for the Aruba cruise, and  lots who have 
expressed interest in going; the 20% group discount is a given.  So, if you 
want to join us on the Oct. 28-Nov 3 cruise on the Legacy be sure and  let me 
know while we still have group space. 
?
For those of you who have paid your deposit, they are already  turned in to 
Windjammer, and your cabins are secure. Those of you who have told  me that 
you won't be able to join us, I hope you don't mind that I included you  in 
this post. If you have any friends who might want to join us, you'll have 
the  information.

TO CONFIRM SPACE
1. E-Mail me at: gail@teleport.com? or
2. Phone me at: (541)765-4577 with your credit card  number? or
3. Send a check to PO Box 1723, Newport, Oregon,  97365.
The deposit for the cruise is $200. If you want Fare Share it  is an 
additional $100.
Let me know the following:
1. What type of cabin do you want? 
??? Commodore Doubles have full sized beds, and  are $900.?
????Standards have?bunks, and are  $800.
2. Do you want Fare Share? 
??? From which airport and which day do you  want to arrive in Aruba and 
depart ??? ??? from  Aruba?
??? Here are some samples of Fare Share Rates  round trip to Aruba:
??? ??? PDX?  $899
??? ??? GSO $649
??????? LEX?  $679
??? ??? SDF  ?$679
??? ??? PHL?  $679
??? ??? CVG?  $727
??? ??? SYR?  $679
??? If you arrive on Sunday and leave on  Saturday, or if Windjammer books 
two ??? ???  nights in a hotel for you, there is no deviation fee. But if you 
only stay one  night, ??? or deviate otherwise, there is a $35 deviation  fee.
3. Do you want trip insurance? It is $85.? 
??? We'll be way?south of the hurricane  belt, but you have to fly over it to 
get to ???  ??? ??? Aruba.? I highly recommend trip  insurance. 
4. Do you want me to make a hotel reservation for you with the  group? 
??? ??? ???  ??? ??? Windjammer's Hotel Dept. is still  negotiating with one 
hotel in Aruba, and it ???  ??? sounds like we'll get a much better rate as a 
group than  trying to book ??? ??? ???  ??? individually. So, in contrast to 
what I said earlier, if you  want a hotel room, let ??? ??? me know which 
night  to book for you. (Right now there is no need to send a ???  ??? 
deposit for the hotel.? If you choose to stay elsewhere  once you find out 
where ??? they put us, that is  fine.)

POLY REPO CRUISE
The Poly repo cruise is Nov. 4 through November 10, from St.  Lucia to St. 
Maarten. She will be coming out of dry dock with a whole new top  deck, and a 
reconfigured bar area. We only have 6 confirmed so far on the Poly,  but 
quite a few are interested, and we still have plenty of time yet to find 9  
more passengers. Deck cabins are $880, Standard Cabins are $720, and the BQ 
is  $560.? Fare Share rates are the same as to Aruba, but they have an  
additional $35 fee because you fly into St. Lucia and out of St. Maarten.  
?
The bad news for those who want to do both weeks, is that  there are no 
direct flights from Aruba to St. Lucia, and you have to go through  San Juan 
to get there. The fare for that leg is close to $400.?  
?
The good news for those who want to do both weeks and have  Aadvantage 
Frequent Flyer miles, is that you can fly from your home to Aruba,  then up 
to St. Lucia, and then home from St. Maarten, all for 30.000 miles, and  
$255.

Hope to see a whole bunch of you next Fall!
