In order to ensure adequate, consistent legal review of on-line terms and
conditions governing use of third party electronic trading platforms, you
must have all registration documentation (including, for example, password
applications and access agreements) approved by the On-Line Trading Legal
Contact before such documentation is submitted or executed.  Any document
that requires acceptance by "clicking" should be treated like any other
legal document.  You are not authorized to accept any such click agreement
without written approval of the On-Line Trading Legal Contact.  In
addition, the On-Line Trading Legal Contact must review and approve all
product descriptions and other on-line terms and conditions applicable to a
product before a password may be used to trade that product on a third
party electronic trading platform.  Accordingly, before any master user or
subuser uses a password to trade a product, he or she must confirm that the
On-Line Trading Legal Contact has approved all applicable product
descriptions and terms and conditions applicable to such product.

   The  current  On-Line Trading Legal Contact is Mark Greenberg (extension
58897) (or in his absence, Mark Taylor (extension 37459)).
