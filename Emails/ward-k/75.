I have found numerous pictures of Frank Vickers along with some of you.  
Since he is leaving Portland I plan on making a scrapbook to hold his 
memories of Portland and you!  If you would like to write a personal note to 
Frank, please do so and send it to me via email, a hand-written note via 
inner-office mail, or drop it at my desk.  Also, I have some special paper at 
my desk if you prefer to use that.  The sooner the better as time is quickly 
running out.

Thanks.

Mollie
