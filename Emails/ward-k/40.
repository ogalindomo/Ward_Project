Hello Fellow Elves.

Just a reminder that monetary donations need to be in this Friday so we can 
buy the gifts this weekend and have them wrapped on Tuesday. Please give them 
to me or Teri Whitcomb with the signup sheet. 

There is a pizza/wrapping party on Tuesday, December 19th that y'all are 
invited too. 

Have a nice day.

Jeffrey Oh
