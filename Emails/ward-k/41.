Only one beer, what a wussy.  I thought you liked Beck's?  I hope this is
something that you wanted if so excellent.  I was looking forward to working
on some long term stuff with you.  Keep me posted on the job.

Go W.!!!

Hey, I know that Paul Choi called you this morning about Mona - I just
wanted to let you know that there is a probobility that I will be going
back to Houston to market gas in the west.  I am very sad to leave Portland
- if it happens.  I will keep you posted but since things haven't quite
been announced, please keep me off of your gossip vine until further
notice!!

If this takes place, we must have one more beer!!

Kim
