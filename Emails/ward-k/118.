Thanks Kim.  It would be great if you could see these to me daily.  I use
the information for two purposes: 1) to run our portfolio VaR and
Mark-to-market numbers, and 2) to have an indication of where the market is
going.

Our attorney has contacted me to let me know that he is reviewing the
Enfolio.

Monica,

Attached are some VERY rough prices for 1,2,3 and 5 years out at Malin and
City Gate.   I am still working on access to the programs for options as
well as more ACCURATE prices.  I know you are just trying to get a feel for
what the market looks like right now so this should be good for that.

Also, it looks like we don't have a master agreement in place with NCPA
which would govern gas transactions.  Those transactions would be done
under the General Terms & Conditions as well.  Did you get a copy of those?
I am following up on getting you a Master Agreement as well as an ISDA and
will keep you posted.

Call me if you have questions or need more info!!

Thanks,

Kim
