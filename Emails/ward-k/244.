Term sheet looks fine.
As for gas pricing, it seems we'd be better off just settling per the
contract.
I'm OK with PG&E Topock, but I'm hopeful that either (i) it will prove to be
more valuable (closer to So Cal) in the future, or (ii) we can work with
PG&E to deliver it to So Cal somehow.

Subject: April through August term sheet update


Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August,
2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we
discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50
bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily
minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our
fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the
system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim
