in August of this year.  This plant is currently under development in
simple cycle configuration and will be converted to combined cycle
operation in the near future.  Its output, 48-60 MW will be sold to the
State of California through the water department.  Delivery point for gas
will be SDG&E city gate.

Please provide 1yr, 3yr, and 5yr price indications including firm capacity.
