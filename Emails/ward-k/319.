I bought the following gas today from Enron:

1. Nov 01 - Mar 02, 2500 MMBtu/day @ CG for $11.86
2. Jul 03 - Jun 04, 2500 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.05
3. Nov 03-Mar04, 1000 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.13

I'll update you on the status of reaching our hedging goals soon.

Raveen, I'll get you the paperwork once I get it from Enron.
