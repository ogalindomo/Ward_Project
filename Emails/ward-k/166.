Just to follow up on our nomination for March 2001:

The total nomination for month of MArch 2001 is 10,000MMBtu per day.  This
includes:
1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (3,993MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from February 2001 to 3.430%.  We
have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day).

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.
