Kim, 

Here is the summary.  The bottom line is that by unwinding balance of 
February (2/20-2/28) and the rest of the deal (Mar '01-Jul '02) from a $3.74 
price to a $4.18 price nets Mesa a $.24 discount of the new Index deal (Aug 
'01-Jan '02)

To get them to a $.30 discount on the new Index deal, Mesa would need to 
raise the fix price on the current deal to $4.26.
