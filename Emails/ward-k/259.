Smurfit is a QF we serve, but as far as I know, they are current.  Kim W. is 
watching them very closely.

Chris,  Do we have any outstanding receivables from QF's that you are aware 
of?

Do we hold any material past due receivables for gas supply against specific 
California QFs?   If so, what action are we planning to take?  With the 
prospect of getting 15 cents on the dollar for old receivables and a 
mechanism in place for future QF payments, this might be a time to consider 
forcing the QFs hand.  May be there is an origination opportunity with a 
contract restructuring or purchase of the plants.
