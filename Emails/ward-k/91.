Art,
In order to facilitate our gas?accounts  payable?process, please email 
monthly to Craig Lipke of Citizens an  electronic spreadsheet?summary?showing 
all of?Citizens'  then-current forward trading positions.? I envision that 
this would be  available by the 10th of the following month (e.g. January's 
report by February  10).? Craig will be using the data to substantiate Enron 
monthly billings  and will verify the spreadsheet data against our hardcopy 
record of gas edeal  sheets/Enron confirmations.? Thank you for your 
cooperation in this matter.  Please call if you have questions.
