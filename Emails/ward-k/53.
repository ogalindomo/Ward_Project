I will be out of the office beginning Wed Dec 20, returning on January 3.  
Over this time I will be checking my voice mail, pretty much every day, and 
working on some ongoing business.  In my absence, please ask callers if 
someone else can help them.  If not, put them into voice mail and I will be 
able to get back to them within a day or so.

Chris
