Subject: gas to Griffith





Barb,

No problem for a July 01 start date on the gas supply we discussed this
morning.  The offer would remain the same whether June is included or not.
Also, we would make a reasonable best efforts to take and/or remarket your
gas when the Griffith plant is down.  Of course, if we couldn't do anything
with it, we would be held harmless.  Pricing would be based on a San Juan
Gas Daily Index minus $.02.  If we have to designate the plant as the
primary delivery point on the capacity, we wouldn't be able to flow the gas
to the border on a firm basis.  We may only be able to sell it back in the
basin.

Give me a call if you have any questions -

Thanks,

Kim Ward
