Talked to SSCC today regarding natural gas contracts for  CA.? 
Wanted a summary from Enron on pricing you could provide  for
1) Month to month deal for all facilities
2)? One year term deal for all facilities less LA Vernon  and month-month for 
LA Vernon.
3) One year for all facilities.
I know that the box plants are benefiting from LA Vernon on  the Index 
deal.?Too many variables still exist to lock into long term Index  deal for 
LA Vernon.? Can you price them separately?
