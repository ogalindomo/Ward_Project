Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted  to John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that  Enron and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price  transactions to hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively  assisting Smurfit Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing  insight into market fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators  if you need.? Give me a call with  your
questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
