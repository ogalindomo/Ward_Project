I just opened the holiday card with the group photo.  Great picture.  It
shows how beautiful the weather is in Portland!  When our group used to do
pictures, we usually ended up looking into the sun - just like you.  We end
up squinting, but otherwise it makes a good picture.  Thank you for thinking
of me.  Be sure to show this to Bob Badeer since I do not have his email
address.  May God bless you all with a wonderful holiday season; and may we
all be exempt from refunds!
