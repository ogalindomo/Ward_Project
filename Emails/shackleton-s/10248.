Steve-

On 3/30/01 we rolled the 2 forwards maturing on 3/31 to 4/30.
On 4/2/01 we amended the forwards so that they now mature on 6/29/01.
Also, we entered into 3 puts maturing on 6/28/01.

Lehman is sending me a spreadsheet with the details, and Lehman Brothers in 
Geneva should send us the confirms shortly.
