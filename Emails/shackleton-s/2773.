Kaye's birthday is right around the corner - Sunday,  August 6th.

I asked her if she would like to go to lunch on 7th and she said she would. 
She chose "Two Rows" in the Rice Village - yet another sports oriented place. 
I think we have her figured out now! 

So...... please let me know: 

1. Do you want to go to lunch with us on Monday the 7th? 

2. Do you want to go in on flowers? If so - how much do you want to 
contribute? 10? 20 ? etc...

3. Any other ideas?

Thanks!
