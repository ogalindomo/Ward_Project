There are only 2 of the new offices that do not have support poles and one of 
them is yours.

Before I order your new files cabinets please look at the office.  One of 
your 2 drawer cabinets can go under the window.  I am going to order two 4 
drawer cabinets for you unless you think that is too much file space.  It 
will take five weeks to get the file cabinets.
