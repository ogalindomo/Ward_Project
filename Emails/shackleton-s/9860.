One more clause we need -- not sure which doc ought to include it at this 
point, but I think it belongs in the Allegheny side letter, b/c it's aimed at 
getting continuing reps as if these transactions are being "entered into" 
under our master:

"Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC represents and warrants to EPMI that 
all the representations and warranties in the Power Master are true and 
correct as of the effective date of this agreement."
