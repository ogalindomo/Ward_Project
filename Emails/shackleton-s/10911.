Thank you for your interest in pursuing membership  with our association.? To 
answer your question about Website Access: ALL  categories of membership are 
given access to the Members Only area.? As you  mention in your latest voice 
mail message, since we?keep missing each  other, I thought I would send you 
some information with this  e-mail.

Please review the attached brief description of  EMTA and the?services we 
provide.? You may also?wish to forward  your mailing address?to me, so that I 
can send you?our entire  Membership Kit, which includes some additional 
information, including our latest  Quarterly bulletin and Annual Report.

In the meantime, if you have any further questions,  please do not hesitate
