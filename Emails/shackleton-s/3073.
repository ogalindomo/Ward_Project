Subject: Issuer Forward Transactions




Jeff - per our conversation today, I have attached a basic equity forward
confirm (note that this is our generic form and will be modified to suit
the contract that we enter into) .  I have also attached a document
discussing a proprietary way that we have developed to enter into tax
deductible forwards.  I look forward to working with you further with
regard to this transaction


Best regards,
