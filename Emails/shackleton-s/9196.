Stephanie, we have a Forecast Services Agreement between ENA and WSI ready 
for signature.  WSI has already signed.  I am forwarding the copies to you -- 
can you get the two copies signed tomorrow and returned to WSI?  Thanx.

Sara, Do you think we need to note this account in lotus notes?  Let me know.
