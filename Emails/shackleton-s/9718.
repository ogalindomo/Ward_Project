Thus, J.P. Morgan is in the process of preparing the revised & final version 
of the Agreement.  They anticipate having it ready for our final review and 
execution next week.  I'll call them next week to make sure they are 
following through.  

Aneela, if you do not hear from me by then, give me a call.
