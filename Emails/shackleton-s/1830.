Sara, my dear. I missed not spending Passover with you, and unlike your
feelings, I mean that! My golf game is getting better and I would love to
show you. How about another trip to Amelia with Pat Mooney! I still have
great memories of that trip. I usually play in Atlanta. Not too many out of
town golfing trips but I would love to go on one with you! Phoenix is great
and we could go to some of the same places that you probably went to with ole
what's his name! Are you still dating that guy? Dump him and let's go out! We
can go to New York and bring Deb back some more Deli stuff. Enron is doing
great. Love those stock options, huh?  Helen is living with my sister Bev in
memphis and would love to hear from you if you feel like
calling(901-682-0269) I would love to hear from you too if you feel like
calling me (404-261-2164).
I assume you know that Ron and Peggy have separated many months ago and are
getting divorced!?    CALL ME!!!!!   Love (and I mean it), Sam
