Sara,

We have a Counterparty with a request to adjust our Floating Price language=
=20
for Propylene so that a couple of things will be specified. =20
1) the published rate is currently one price only.  They do not specify a=
=20
high and low (But it is possible that a high and low do get published)
2) the publication calls the price "settlement" price in the description.=
=20
Therefore, this Counterparty wishes to see that language included.=20

Current:
The Floating Price for each Calculation Period shall be the arithmetic=20
average of the high and low price of Propylene - chemical grade in=20
