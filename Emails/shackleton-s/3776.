To catch everyone up, we have changed the Danno C transaction to McGarret D.  
The debt and equity received by the trust in McGarret D will be used to repay 
the McGarret B series, which will then be terminated, and the excess funds 
will go to Enron pursuant to the Total Return Swap executed in connection 
with the McGarret B closing.

Attached, in WordPerfect format, for immediate execution are the following 
three documents:

Asset Notice (258187) (clean and marked against latest draft);
Prepayment Notice w/respect to McGarret B (259570) (clean); and
Direction Letter to Owner Trustee (258312) (clean and marked against latest
     draft.

Gina Karanthanos - Please (i) coordinate with Charles to determine the final 
debt and equity amounts for Series McGarret D, (ii) complete the blanks in 
the Asset Notice and the Direction Letter, (iii) send an executed, clean copy 
of the Asset Notice to Mercy Arango, and (iv) send a clean copy of the 
Direction Letter to Mercy Arango for execution.
