We just received the final draft of the Raymond James agreement by email so 
we should have it executed this week.  Sara, let's discuss first -- I wanted 
to show you the limitation of liability clause as per our discussion; it will 
need Mark H.'s approval.

I will be out of the office for the rest of the afternoon recovering from my 
flu.
