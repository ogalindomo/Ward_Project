Carol and Sara,

Susan forwarded this message to me.  It looks like a counterparty is 
requesting our form of confirmation.

Stephanie,

Please check with Sara or Carol to see if we can furnish such sample 
information to a Counterparty.  

I do not if this would be considered proprietary information, because it is 
in association with our form of confirmation, but they may feel differently.

Thanks for the help.


Cordially,

Hi, thanks it would be a preISDA, I am actually looking for some samples.
We have an ISDA in place with you so we've been using the short form,
however I was looking for some language on a long form in particular for
periods greater than : Calculation periods greater than one month.  I would
appreciate whatever you could provide, Thank you so much for your prompt
response and assistance. Katalin
