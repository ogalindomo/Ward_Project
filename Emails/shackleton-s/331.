Brent Hendry has informed me of the Argentina Power Desks request to reflect 
payment of the Fixed Amounts in USD. If this request is approved, I will need 
to have the deal tickets modified (with a handwritten note, something to the 
effect of "Fixed Amounts payable in USD"), so I can revise the Confirmation.

If this request is approved, please fax the modified deal tickets to my 
attention at 646-2495.

Thanks in advance.
