Subject: Morgan Stanley Prime Broker Agreement and Overseas Lending Agreement

Sara,
May I have a copy of the Morgan Stanley Prime Broker Agreement and the 
Overseas Lending Agreement.
Jeff and I have been talking to Goldman Sachs about a similar arrangement and 
wanted to re-review the Morgan Stanley structure.
Thank. Sheila
