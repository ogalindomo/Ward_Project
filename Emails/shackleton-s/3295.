Sara,

1.  Re number of shares - Assume there is one or more Notice Dates for x 
number of shares and a final Termination Date for [1.093,426 - x] shares.  As 
written, would the calculation on the Termination Date be based on (a) 
1,093,426 shares or (b) [1,093,426 - x] shares?  It should be (b), but it 
looks to me like the confirm says (a)?

Am I mis-reading this?

2.  Picky point - but if the final date is both a Notice Date and a 
Termination Date, is the calculation only done once?

Regards

JAG
