Nicholas:

Henry Steuart asked me to forward to your attention the revised draft ISDA
Schedule which I previously sent to Ms. Flynn. As I mentioned in my last note 
to
Ms. Flynn, the attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Sincerely yours,
Mike Stolfi
