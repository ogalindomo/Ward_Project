Sara,
Last week we spoke about a process to make sure we have Broker Agreements in 
place.
I spoke with John last week.  We will initiate the following immediately. 
 When we utilize a new executing broker, John will provide to us the name for 
entry into the middle office system and Kelly Templeton will follow up with 
the executing broker to get a customer agreement from the broker and forward 
to you in Legal for review.  
Kelly is currently following up with Hambrecht & Quist and Thomas Weisel 
Partners.  

John and I also discussed the level of risk related to different broker 
relationships and the required documentation:
Executing Broker: We do not have an account open with the broker nor do we 
hold positons .  We only have a trade settlement risk.
OTC Activity:  An ISDA agreement should be in place to cover the derivative 
activity.
Service Agreements: Instinet, Posit
Prime Broker/Futures Account:  Hold postions and dollars in account 

thanks. sheila
