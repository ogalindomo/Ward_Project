Ever had a great idea but been uncertain what to do with it?  It's the mental 
equivalent of being all dressed up with no place to go.

Happily, there is help for the idea problem.  The next time you have a 
brilliant idea, make a deposit in the Idea Vault on the ThinkBank.

The ThinkBank will help you earn credit for your ideas.  You can even watch 
your line of credit grow!

And, the next time you're all dressed up with no place to go, just change 
your clothes and have dinner delivered.
