I have finally put together a binder on the materials from the ISDA seminar I 
attended in October; day one was devoted to credit derivatives, and day two 
was devoted to collateral/credit support in general.

Enclosed is an index of the materials; please feel free to take a look at the 
binder if you wish. -- Bob
