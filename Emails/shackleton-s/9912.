Denis,

Just a follow-up regarding the captioned counterparties.  It is my 
understanding, ISDA Master Agreements have been entered into.   As you know, 
information regarding masters must be entered into our FTA Database under 
Lotus Notes, as well as copies of the agreements are needed for our files.

Please direct me at the address set forth below: (a) FTA database info, and 
(b) copies of the executed Master Agreements.

You prompt attention to this request is greatly appreciated.


Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey
