On Sunday, February 20, 2000, just before the start of the Daytona 500, in
front of Mark Martin's car (#6, of course), Allison Sher and Adam Feinberg
were engaged.  The future bride had no idea beforehand but read her proposal
in the Winston Times, a NASCAR newspaper.  No wedding date has been set,
since the future bride is still in shock!

Note also that Allison's e-mail address should be changed to albsher@juno com
(home instead of work).
