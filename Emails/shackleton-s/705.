AFAC - Thank you for your response.  It is difficult for me when I do not hear
from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were engaged in
other Enron matters.  I am looking forward to your response since the trading
issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).  Once "the Enron
group" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to schedule another
meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.  I look forward to receiving the 
memo
and chart.  Thank you and regards.  Sara

P.S.  Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum.
