That's great. Should mean we are set to sign final docs. Is that your

Susan:

Tudor are prepared to not list Treasuries as Eligible Collateral - so the 
issue
goes away I think.

Thanks.

Daniel  - We have not sent you a revised draft of the ISDA as our trader is
speaking with your client's trader re: the issue of treasuries.  Our Credit
Department thinks that if your client can use treasuries, we should be able
to use LCs.   Our trader is waiting to hear back from your client's
trader.

Susan:

On the open issues:

(1) Eligible Collateral - Tudor will agree to Cash as the only form of
Eligible
Collateral.

(2) Loss v Market Quotation - Tudor will agree to Loss for those trades
that
still have 2+  years to run on the date of early termination.

(3) Jurisdiction - Tudor will not agree to "any court". Tudor will agree to
NON-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY Courts though.

I look forward to receiving revised drafts.

Kind regards.

Daniel Harris
