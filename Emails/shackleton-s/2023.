Sara,
Carlos from CS First Boston called... CS First Boston needs to set up an 
account for the entity to deliver off the shares to us.  We do not have an 
account with them and one is needed to execute settlement and delivery of the 
shares  to our Morgan Stanley account. 

The settlement will be on 5/30, Tuesday, for 6 million shares at 2.90 GBP per 
share.  I am need to confirm if the bridge loan will cover or payment will be 
required on Tuesday.  

CS First Boston needs to set up the account:
Benificiary ownership letter for shares
Registration name on shares
Wants to know if entity is listed in the UK and regulated, net asset value of 
the company.
