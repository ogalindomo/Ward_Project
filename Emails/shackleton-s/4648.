Sara,
 I am forwarding to you some documentation I received from Goldman Sachs 
related to changes that will apply to all OTC equity options entered into on 
or after November 1, 2000.  Please review documentation.  They are looking 
for us to sign off and return the enclosed documents.


Thanks,
Theresa Brogan
