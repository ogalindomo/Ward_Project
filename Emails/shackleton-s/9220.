I am forwarding to your attention a clean and red-lined draft of the revised 
Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.   Please note that we are still 
waiting to receive comments from your Treasury Department on the Guaranty 
from Cargill Incorporation.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me at the 
number referenced below or Sara  at (713) 853-5620.  We look forward to 
hearing from you soon.
