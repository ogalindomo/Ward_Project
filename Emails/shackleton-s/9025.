David Arpi of the Port of Oakland is interested in looking at the ISDA.  Ed 
Sacks in Credit will send you the credit profile.  We have already sent the 
EEI to him and he is reviewing it (Shari Stack is the physical lawyer working 
on it).  Let me know if you have any questions - you can reach David at 
510-658-8393.  Thanks for your help.
