John,  I will deliver the originals for your signature as vp of ena.  Please 
verify the executing brokers' identities, provide me a contact person at each 
firm, and return the docs to me at EB3807.  I will have our paralegal forward 
them for signatures of the executing brokers.  If you would like to handle in 
another manner, just advise.  Thanks.  Mary
