Sara,

I apologize for the delay in getting the signed Agreement back to you. We
are waiting to receive it back from our Zurich office (unfortunately the
person required to sign has been out). We should have faxed signature pages
(which we can, in turn, fax to you) at some point tomorrow. In addition, we
should be able to get you your original copy later this week.

Regards,
Kimberly
