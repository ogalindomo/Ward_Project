The ISDA agreement has been executed by DEI and will be returned to Enron.
In
the meantime, can you please have your confirmation desk confirm the deal
with
Roni Cappadonna and send the confirm letter to her attention, as soon as 
possible.

Thanks.

Good!  I hope this is the first of a number of transactions we enter into 
together.   Please have your people sending the ISDA back to our lawyers in 
Houston with Duke's signature so we then complete the loop.

Julian, would you please co-ordinate asap with our Houston staff to have them 
sending the confirmation to Roni at the fax number below?  Thanks.
