My bad; I had made the changes we discussed with the last Product in PROD but 
not in TEST, so when I built the new Product in TEST I got old text. I have 
since corrected TEST (to make sure that this doesn't happen again) and 
double-checked that the text is correct in PROD. Thanks for your review. 

Sara - please review THIS Long Description and offer comments/approval.
