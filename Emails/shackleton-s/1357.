There have been growing concerns regarding the copying and distribution of 
licensed and copyrighted materials among various groups within Enron.  For 
example, if you are a subscriber to Petroleum Argus, Intelligence Press, 
Energy Intelligence, Opis, or any other information source, it is unlawful to 
copy and distribute that information among others if only one 
license/subscription is ordered.

Such activity exposes Enron to legal ramifications and reflects poorly on our 
reputation as a professional and ethical company. 

If you have copyrighted material that you would like distributed, please 
contact either Bruce Ferrell at 853-4815, or Julie Pechersky at 853-9225 in 
Market Data, to address the issue.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
