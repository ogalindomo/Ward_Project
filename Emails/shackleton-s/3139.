Sara,
We already have done something for ING Barings or it is in the works in 
Legal.  We have had a long standing relationship with Furman Sels as an 
executing Broker.  ING Barings bought them and sent us documentation to 
change the agreement to the name of ING Barings.

Mike,
If you think you guys need a relationship, check with Theresa to see if we 
already have one.  Again, equities should go through John Greene unless 
packaged hedge. 

Please call if questions.

Sheila
