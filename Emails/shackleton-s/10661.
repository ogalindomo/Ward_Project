Sara

I am the person looking to transact deals with Enron North America.  I speak 
to
a number of people at Enron but my main contact is Aaron Armstrong.  I would
expect to trade interest rate swaps and options, government bonds and repos.

I hope this helps.  If there is anything that I can do to speed up the process
please let me know.

Kind regards
