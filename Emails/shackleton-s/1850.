Sheila and Kelly,

I am working with Sara Shackleton for the next few months (on loan from 
Andrews & Kurth).  This morning I am sending comments to the above-referenced 
Agreement to both Chase H&Q and Thomas Weisel.   Please also note that Sara 
sent comments out yesterday to Direct Trading on the Customer Agreement.  
Should you have any questions, my extension is 3-9720.

Jason Peters
