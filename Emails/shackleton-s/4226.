Joe Hunter has requested that in the future he be provided copies of all 
confirmations in respect of any structured finance transactions in which we 
participate.  To the extent we cannot quickly get executed versions, he would 
like to receive the final draft versions.  I will discuss coordinating this 
with Global Finance Legal during our Raptor process meeting next week.
