Enron, as a pacesetter company, is preparing for the annual United Way=20

at=20
work preparing for this event.  In 1999, Enron achieved a 17% increase in=
=20
contributions compared to 1998 and for the 10th consecutive year we were on=
e=20
of Houston=01,s largest contributors.  With your help, we can continue this=
=20
trend and achieve our Enron-wide goal for 2000 of $2,310,000.

We are poised to play a significant role in this year's campaign.  I am=20
asking that the head of each business unit nominate one or more individuals=
=20
from their department to serve as "United Way Cheerleaders" (aka ENA UW=20
Campaigners).  Please provide one person for every 20 employees in your=20
business unit.   These volunteers will help ENA=01,s United Way coordinator=
s=20
promote and educate employees about the United Way and Enron's campaign.=20

Last year Enron's company-wide participation level was 78%. Several busines=
s=20
units had 100% participation. However, ENA had the worst rate at 56%. =20
Needless to say, this is not the position we want to be in at the end of th=
is=20
year=01,s campaign and the campaigners you appoint are vital to improving o=
