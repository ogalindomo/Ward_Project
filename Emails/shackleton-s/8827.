Sara, Janelle - The terms that we have agreed to are transaction specific.  
Given the unfavorable credit terms for Enron, we will have to give serious 
consideration if we should elect to trade with this counterparty in the 
future, unless we can force them to deviate from thier credit policies.  Good 
luck on the other issues.
