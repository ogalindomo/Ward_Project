Brent and Susan -

Attached is a worksheet for an Omnibus confirm for trade QO6792, with Rising 
Star Energy, LLC.  This counterparty is not an eligible swap participant, so 
we are requiring that they post a $5,000 letter of credit in association with 
this trade.  Brent, you will recall that this is the counterparty that you, 
Sara, and I discussed last Friday afternoon.  Sara, Fred Lagrasta and I have 
been discussing this issue today, and the attached sheet reflects our 
agreed-upon terms.

We need to get this confirm sent out as soon as possible, so anything that 
you can do to expedite the process is greatly appreciated.

Please give me a call at ext. 53923 if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Jay
