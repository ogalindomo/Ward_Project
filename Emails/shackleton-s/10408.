Hi Stephanie, could you let me know where we stand with getting execution 
signatures for the following brokerage agreements:

Sanford Bernstein - executing broker

Merrill Lynch -- executing broker

(they have been marked "sent for execution" on the legal status report) as 
well as any others we have sent since our last meeting.  Since we will no 
longer meet as frequently, please send me an email as soon as we get 
agreements fully executed so that I can update the list.
