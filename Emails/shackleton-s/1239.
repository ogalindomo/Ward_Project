Drop by.  We've been trading financial power for over a year.  Not many 
deals, though.

Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.  I was not aware we 
were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to 
open up.  I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot 
trade.  So, I've go to start opening up my utilities...
