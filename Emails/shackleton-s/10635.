We have a signed ISDA and CSA dated 26th October 2000 between Enron Credit 
Ltd and Morgan Stanley Credit Products Ltd (Cayman).
I wasn't aware of anything else.

Subject: ISDA Master Agreement with Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. 
("MSCS")

All:

I received a draft master agreement from MSCS for proposed execution with 
Enron North America Corp.  Are any of you trying to push execution of this 
agreement?  Have either of Enron Credit, Inc. or Enron Credit Limited been 
speaking with MSCS about this?

Please advise.  Thanks.
