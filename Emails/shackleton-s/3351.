Sara, Susan,

Attached is a credit worksheet for Markwest.  Susan Flynn and Carol had been 
working on this before they left.  I do not know who would handle this now, 
but please foward as appropriate.  If you read in the Lotus Notes database, 
Susan F.  left a comment that credit was reviewing and would resend a new 
worksheet.  Attached is this worksheet.  It is suggested that a new ISDA is 
put in place instead of amending the agreement.

Thanks
Russell
