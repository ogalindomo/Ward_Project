Subject: Right to Terminate Language- Verdict

Good Morning Sara,

Have you had an opportunity to review the Right to Terminate Language for the 
Merrill Lynch and Bank of Montreal Interest Rate Swap Confirmations? 

Please advise if it is acceptable to Enron.

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,

Jorge
