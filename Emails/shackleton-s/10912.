Subject: PCGs between Enron N.A. and Cargill-Alliant

I am attaching the latest versions.  Most of the additional changes
were accepted in an attempt to get these executed asap, particularly as
I have been out of town the last week or so.  We did change payment
back to 10 days as this is essentially where our corporate treasury is
confident it can process such claims in a prudent manner.  I hope this
is not a deal breaker.  We did ultimately accept your Enron affiliate
set off language in your PCG to us, although we do not have such
language in our PCG to you.

Please reflect on the latest status.  I believe we do have a document
that we can both execute.  If your lawyers still have questions let me
know so I can refer them to our legal counsel if necessary.

Thank you and best regards
