Sara,

Per Theresa Brogan's request, I am writing to request the existing 
templates.  I did receive your message this morning.  I did not hear from 
Cheryl, but that is O.K.  I would like, however, to move quickly on setting 
up this account.

Let me know a time this afternoon that works for you.

Best,

Claude
