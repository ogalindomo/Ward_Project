Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.


Will you pass it on
