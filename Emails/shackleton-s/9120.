Sara & Ed,

Jennifer Sabine, the trader who originally asked me to prepare a worksheet no 
longer works for Fred Lagrasta, so I doubt she is the one pushing this.  
Unless Ed knows something else or has already addressed the question of 
agency ISDA's with utilities/munis, I am of similair opinion with you Sara.  
That being, if the individual munis/utilities desire to trade term financial 
business, we should pursue individual contracts with them directly and not 
through affiliated agencies.

None of Fred's people are pushing this.  And I am not pushing this.  Ed, 
unless you have reason to pursue this, I would advise holding off any further 
effort until an origination/trading function can be identified.

Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
"represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.
