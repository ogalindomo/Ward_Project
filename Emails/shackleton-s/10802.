I am unavailable Wed - Fri next week.  We really need to discuss this and 
have the agreement executed.  

Tracy and I propose 12 pm EST (11 am CST and 9 am PST) on Monday, April 30.  
We believe this will be a very short discussion.

Please reply to both of us.  Thanks.

Yair:

Tracy and I would like to discuss the "Transfer" issue with you tomorrow,
if possible.  We think this should be a short discussion (maybe 10
minutes).  How is 1 pm NY time, tomorrow Wednesday April 25?  This seems to
be the most convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3
pm NY time.

Would you please email your response?

Thanks.
