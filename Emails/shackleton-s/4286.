Sara,

Darren has executed trades between Enron Japan and Chase London, and between 
Enron Japan and ENA (Enron Global Mkts).  Presumably we document the internal 
trade as RMT to Enron Japan-- but Enron Japan what?  Corp? Inc? Ltd?  Please 
advise.  Thanks!  Also, do we execute the trade to Chase as Enron Japan or 
ENA?
