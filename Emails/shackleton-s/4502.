Sara, is there a policy on opening trading accounts?  How is the authorized 
trader list updated and do you know how it is communicated?  Would you give 
me a call at 31939 when you get a chance.  Thanks alot. Donna

Hi,

Thanks for your message.  I was looking for any policy or procedures that you 
may have with regard to opening / revising trading accounts with brokers,  
and notifying brokers of traders authorised to trade futures / derivatives on 
regulated exchanges.   Do you have anything that covers this?

regards
