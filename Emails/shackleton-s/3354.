Kristina, please forward as you deem necessary to EBS persons for final 
approval.  Thank you.

Please see attached language concerning the Raptor swaps in respect of the 
Valuation Date mechanism and advise me as soon as possible of your approval 
or comments, if any.  We are trying to finalize all public swaps (save Active 
Power) today, so your timeliness will be GREATLY appreciated by me!  Mary
