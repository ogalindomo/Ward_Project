We have not formed any such entity, nor are there any plans to at this time.

If we apply to the CFTC for an "Agricultural Trade Option Merchant" license, 
then we will certainly form a new entity for this, although we have not 
decided whether or not we will apply for the license.

Have we formed a separate legal entity or entities for agricultural trading, 
or are we planning on using ENA?

At Larry Lawyer's request, we are trying to compile a list of all of the 
legal entities doing trading or other actitvities within the Enron Global 
Markets arena.

Thanks for your help.

Alan
