Regarding the attached from Brent/Tanya, do you have any language you could 
provide me that was included in the confirms with Vitol?  I didn't see 
anything in the file.

Thanks.

Can you look to see what was done with Vitol?  Let's discuss what you find 
when you have a moment in the next day or two.

The weather desk has done several transactions with Dynegy.  The problem from 
a confirmation perspective is that the master we have with Dynegy is not an 
ISDA.  I know Sara made modifications to the Vitol master when we ran into 
the same issue.  I think she just included some other language in the 
confirmation.  Can we approach Dynegy the same way?  Celeste Cisneros has 
several deals she needs to confirm. Dynegy is on our list of Masters to be 
converted into ISDAs, but is not a high priority.  Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Tanya
