Jason/Sara,

I agree with both attachments.  We should have already settled the May 
portion of all of these deals with MEGA, so hopefully someone is telling them 
to forward those funds on to Morgan (if we were due to pay), or hopefully 
we've recieved the funds already (if we're due to receive).

Thanks,
Joe
