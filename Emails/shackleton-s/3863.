Scott has advised that he and Julia Chin cannot attend the Raptor processes 
meeting, and at his request we will cancel and reschedule.  My assistant will 
be contacting you to set up a new date after quarter end.

Scott, by this memo, per your voice mail, if you would like to get together 
early next week to discuss the suggested process, just give me a call.  Mary
