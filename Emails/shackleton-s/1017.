Subject: Initial Draft of the Physical PPA for Project Moosehead


Attached is an initial draft of the physical PPA for Project Moosehead.  The 
draft for the financial PPA will be ready this afternoon for distribution.  
Given the extremely tight time frame we are under I would appreciate any 
comments you may have as soon as possible.  

Thanks, 
Rodney Malcolm
