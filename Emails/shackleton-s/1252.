Now that we are past the end of the year rollover, a question has been raised 
concerning whether or not Y2K representations and warranties should be given 
or requested in connection with acquisitions and divestitures.  It is our 
recommendation that no special Y2K representations be given or requested.  
Obviously, there may be situations in which some form of general 
representation or warranty may be appropriate with respect to the condition 
of computer hardware, software and related systems.  In such situations, we 
suggest that representations and warranties that are customarily used for the 
purchase or sale of computer hardware, software and related assets be 
utilized.  If you have any further questions on this matter, please contact 
Alan Aronowitz or Michael Robison.
