ALMOST DONE:  Cargill, Idacorp, Utilicorp

BRANT:  Dynegy Canada, Occidental, Duke Energy Marketing Limited P'p

ED:  Mieco, Inc.

RUSSELL:  PanCanadian Energy Services, WPS Energy Services

TANYA:  J.Aron (we need commercial help to push this)

Please review the comments taken at each meeting and distributed to
