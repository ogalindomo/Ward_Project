Sara, I received your e-mail yesterday and was unsure whether the form of
guaranty you attached was the correct form. I understand you talked to Kris
and agreed that the original form distributed was not the preferred
document. Was the attached guaranty another copy of the first form of
guaranty distributed, or is the updated version?
