In light of the expanding Enron global messaging environment and the recent 
influx of inappropriate "mis-directed" mail messages addressed to 
company-wide distribution groups, a new centralized "mass mail" 
administration service is being introduced.

As of Friday, the 20th of August 1999, all company-wide distribution groups 
were made unavailable for addressing by the general Notes user population.

All requests intended for distribution to company-wide distribution groups 
must be submitted to the following email accounts :

Enron North American Notes Users send to :  Corp Notes Admin/Corp/Enron@Enron
Enron Europe Notes Users send to :   Enron Europe General Announcement@ECT

The above accounts are monitored on a regular basis and requests submitted 
are reviewed for mass-mailing "suitability." Company-wide email addressing is 
restricted to business use of the email system.  Upon verification and review 
of the requests, a message will be drafted for distribution and sent out 
after 6 p.m. on the requested distribution date.  In case of emergency 
distributions, please contact your local help desk.

All requests must indicate the following information :

Requester name(s) (if this information is omitted, the sender will be 
considered the "contact" for the request.)
Requester contact number(s)
Intended audience for the message
The text message (Please avoid large graphic files)
Required send date & time

All "mass-mailing" requests must be submitted before 1:00 p.m. on the day 
"distribution" is required. If special mailing lists are required, a period 
of 24 hours may be required to draft the list from Human Resources.

Regards,
Enron Global Messaging Administration
