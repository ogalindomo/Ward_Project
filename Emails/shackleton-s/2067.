Ladies,

On Tuesday, May 30th, we will be receiving GBP 17,400,000 into Enron 
Investments PLC prime brokerage account at Morgan Stanley.  We will need to 
immediately wire the sterling back out to CSFB.  As part of the account set 
up paper work, we need to be sure that we set up signatories for fund 
transfers as well.  I will need to notify Morgan by Thursday, May 25th  in 
order the get the payment out to CSFB, so I will need an authorized signatory 
list by that time.   Please let me know if I can do anything to assist in 
this process.  

I'm not sure who we are considering for commercial contacts to transfer 
funds, BUT, Jeff Kinneman, Gary Hickerson and John Greene are all out of the 
office for the rest of the week.  Do we need to commercial signatures, or can 
we set it up as two back office signatures for one time authority only?
