I will be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday (May 22-23) to attend a 
National Grain and Feeds Association seminar on trading rules.  I will check 
voice messages frequently while out of the office.  My assistant, Mary Helen 
Martinez (52459) will know how to reach me in case of emergency. -- Bob
