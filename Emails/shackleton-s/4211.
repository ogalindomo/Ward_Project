Sara,

Ellen asked me to check with you regarding where we stand on the Warburg 
Dillon Read repo agreement.  Could you let me know?

Also,  I had faxed a BNP Paribas confirm to legal for review last Thursday, 
and I believe Tana or Kaye was going to put in on your desk.  Have you had a 
chance to review this document?  Let me know if we need to make any changes.  
Thank you.

Hope you had a good vacation!
