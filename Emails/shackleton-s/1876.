Sara,

Nick Stephan has agreed to meet with us to inform us about various aspects of 
securities/commodities/futures trading.  Both Nick and I are flexible on our 
schedules, but propose Tuesday at 10:00am for a one-hour initial meeting.  
Please confirm whether this will work for you (or propose an alternate 
day/time) so I can make arrangements for a meeting room.

Paul
