I just wanted to make sure this was handled.  Also, we have capacity in Lotus 
Notes for confirm comments.

I left a message with Judy Lee on Wednesday and left a voice mail with Scott 
as well.  I have not heard back from Swiss Re yet.

I received a call from Judy Lee at Swiss RE (212-317-5523) regarding the 
standard confirmation we use.  She said that their legal department wishes to 
omit Section 4 on Representation.  I said I would forward it on to our legal 
department for consideration.  Below, I have attached the most recent confirm 
we sent them.  Please advise on how I should proceed.
Thanks
Scott
