Per my voice mail, you can see the floating price index language (power and 
gas) that I need.  Please email or fax so that I can insert it into my draft 
confirm.  Thanks.  Sara

Guys,

Attached are the term sheets with the changes we discussed this morning.  I 
will be sending them out early this afternoon so if you get a chance to go 
over them one last time and let me know if there are any busts I'd 
apprieciate it.

Thanks for all the help,
Rodney
