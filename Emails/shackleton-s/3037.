Gary and I met with Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman last week to update them 
on the overall effort in Agriculture and more specifically our efforts 
related to Trading and Origination.  All of you and/or your groups were 
mentioned regarding your participation and individual efforts.  Gary and I 
would like to share this presentation with  you and overall progress to date.

A meeting has been set for Thurs, Aug 17 at 1:00 in 3014.  If you have any 
questions, please call me @ 37613.

Thanks
