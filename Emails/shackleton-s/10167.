Aneela, thank you again for attending our meeting today.  My assistant, 
Keegan Farrell, is going to update the Brokerage Agreement list to reflect 
our report today and distribute it by the end of the day tomorrow.

The updated list will indicate that the agreements completed recently include:

ING Barrings
Lehman
Jeffries
Salomon
Frost (Deutsche Bank)
Simmons
Robertson Stephens
Raymond James
JP Morgan

Perhaps by the end of the week we will have Goldman Sachs International ready 
by Friday and Sanford Bernstein by Monday or Tuesday.  I will keep you 
posted.
