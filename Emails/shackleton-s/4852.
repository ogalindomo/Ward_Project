Sara,

Our traders want to know the status on the agreements for JP Morgan and Bear 
Stearns.  They would also like to begin using these services with additional 
brokers and need to know how long it takes legal to provide our comments to 
the executing broker from the point that we receive the initial agreement 
from them.  Please advise as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Aneela
