Dear Sara:
It was a pleasure to speak with you this evening. I faxed my resume to your
office just now. There are 2 versions...only the PROFILE section differs.
One is marketing focused the other more business consulting or general
business, please use which ever one you deem best.
I really appreciate your interest in my job search and I am very grateful
for any assistance you may offer.
Best Regards,
Kristina
