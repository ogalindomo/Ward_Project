I'm not sure who Philip Levy is, but yes, I did have my questions answered.

Bruce was able to help me set up the notification for Chase, and before I even

Thanks,
Diane

Did you have your questions answered?  I have a voice mail from Philip Levy 
and need to respond.  Please give me a call after Thanksgiving.  Thanks.  Sara
