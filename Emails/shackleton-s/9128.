In terms of time references, the convention in Canada is that all time
references are to Toronto time.  In addition, with respect to defaults, the
Canadian practice (including Merrill Lynch Canada's) as to fails on the
initial delivery will depend on the duration of the trade.  For long dated
trades, the trade will be revised to reflect the original duration less the
delay for the initial delivery.  For short dated trades, payment will be
made as if the securities had been delivered.

If you require additional information, please contact me.
