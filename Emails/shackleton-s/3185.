Sara and I will get together to discuss and let you know later on this week 
our thoughts if that's ok.

Regards, Alan

Alan, and Sara,
We had spoken about a month ago that the Credit and Convertible Books may be 
moved into Enron North America from ECT Investments Inc..
Please advise what we need to do to do this.  At the prime Brokers we can 
move these separate books to the ENA grouping of books.  What do we need to 
do from a Corporate structure side since ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly 
owned sub of ENA at this time?

Enron Credit.com is currently using the ENA entity for deals with US 
courterparties. 

Thanks, Sheila
