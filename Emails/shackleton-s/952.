Subject: Multi-Purpose Guaranty Form

Enclosed is the form that I think we should use for multi-purpose Guarantys.  
This form is the Counterparty form but we can easily create from this the 
Enron form.  Tana, this is similar to what you gave me but incorporates the 
defined terms that I think we need in this document.
