Hey Sara, thanx for your words of encouragement.  It is very important to me 
that you think that I am doing a good job, the positive feedback offsets all 
the frantic calls from the people downstairs.  

The Authroized Traders List for Enron Credit Inc. is done -- we really just 
need to finalize the agreements with the brokers which i think can happen 
quickly since we are not trying to reinvent the wheel.  

I just realized that my conference call with Anna is 10 New York time and 
then I have a conference call with Claude on his deal. So, I am going to get 
on your calendar tomorrow but it might not be until late morning, not first 
thing.  At the meeting, I can let you know where we stand with the other 
tasks.
