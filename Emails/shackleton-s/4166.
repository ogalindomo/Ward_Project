		 Subject: FX Description

Here's what I hope will be the final version of the FX Product Long 
Description, which is based on conversations between Brent Hendry, William 
Stuart, and myself. I suspect that this is very close to being finalised by 
both Brent and William.

Per this mornings conversation between Amita and I, PCG Houston will build 
and maintain this Product Type. We will commence the building of the Product 
Type once I have (i) an answer back on the trading Legal Entity and (ii) 
David Forster's input on whether to treat this as a physical or financial 
Product; and how to handle the Location/Index issue.

Dale
