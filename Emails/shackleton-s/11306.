Cheryl,
Attached is a DATA Provider agreement to be reviewed.  There is a one page 
Subscription agreement which I will forward to you.  
This does not require RAC approval.  
The agreement should be in the name of ECT Investments, Inc. and not Enron 
Corp.
Please call if questions.
Thanks. Sheila

Chris,
There is a technical link below.  Info is accessed via the web and also the 
data base which is installed once (on a local pc or server for multiple 
access).  The database is then updated nightly.  
Please let me know.  Ellen at SNL said you can call her with questions.
Sheila
