Sara,

I have been unable to locate the executed agreement.  I will contact Merrill 
Lynch and see if they can provide a copy.  However, if we need an original, 
perhaps we should have it executed again.

I have the blue file in my office and a marked version of the ENE guaranty.  
However, we are missing the recent assisgnment from the NY office to London 
which you and I discussed last week.  I was waiting for you to figure out 
whether the assignment is MIA.  SS
