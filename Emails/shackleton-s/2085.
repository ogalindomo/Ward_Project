Rod and Susan:  The CP's lawyer asked for a new draft so we can redraft on 
our new form.  Unless Rod objects, we will use the same credit.  Rod, there 
will be  cross default  and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we 
can discuss when CP returns comments.  Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and 
she would like to be copied on the redraft.  Thanks.  Sara
