Sara:

Joe Hunter and I enjoyed meeting with you earlier today.

I've attached a file which includes the new index language for your review, 
including hours
for on-peak and off-peak for each one.

(the Palo Verde and SP15 language has been created before, but since
Edith Cross requested these as well, I included them here)

We are looking forward to working with you in reviewing this language for the 
new indices.

Regards,
