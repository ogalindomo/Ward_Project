Jason:  Please let me know where we stand on this and what steps we are
currently taking to finalize.

On a different matter, I spoke with Mike Neves on Friday afternoon and we
concluded that getting you hooked up to Lotus Notes was becoming too
complicated.  Please email your updates to me and I will enter onto Lotus
Notes.

Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  I have approved all of your invoices for payment.

Sara,

Where do we stand on the contractual issues associated with getting this
software installed on our desktops?

Thanks and regards,
John
