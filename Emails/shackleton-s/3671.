Mahesh,
This confirms our discussion that the the UK entity will have two separate 
service agreements.  One with ENA for Prop Debt Trading and one with ECT 
Investments Inc for Equities Trading.    
In London, we can book directly into the underlying entity, e.g. 
Energy-London Book,  At the end of the month, we will record  income based 
upon activity to the Arranger, New UK entity,  and record the offsetting 
expense to the Serviced book (Energy London).  
Many thanks.
Sheila

I have a quick question - Would the pricipal for the bonds/Equities business 
done from London be ENA or ECT Investments Inc.  I recall from our meeting 
that it was ECT due to the regulatory environment - can you please confirm

Thanks
Mahesh
