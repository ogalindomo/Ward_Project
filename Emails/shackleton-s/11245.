Sara,

The confirms pulled in under an ENA Master Agreement (dated 9/1/94), not 
under an
ISDA Master Agreement, as Tanya was mentioning.   

I looked in the Financial Trading Agreements database and confirmed the ENA 
Master.

After you've incorporated the changes, please send them back to me, because
Derek is has to send them to George for his review, and then I'll fax them 
out:
