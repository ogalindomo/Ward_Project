Hello Elliot, 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you until now.  Either I am out of the office 
or in meetings all day.  Last we spoke you were going to send me a copy of 
the previous agreed upon ISDA between Heinz and Enron.  I believe you wanted 
our legal contact but is there anyway you can send the copy to my attention.  
I would like to have a copy for my files.  
We have not made a decision yet on linerboard swaps.  I have a meeting with 
my General Manager on Monday PM and hope to know more.  
Can you please send me a copy of the ISDA prior to Monday PM? 
Thanks, 
Dewann Weltmer

Have you made a decision on this swap yet?  Please let me know either way. 
Thanks.

   Hi Elliott, 
   I talked with Corby and today we have an offer around $428/ton for 2 
   years 5,000 tons.  Can you provide a better offer that we could discuss? 
   Thanks,
