Sara,

Shari Stack told to me to get in contact with you about the things she was 
working on for me before she jumped ship.

I work for Gary Hickerson's group in Australia and Shari was looking at a 
futures execution agreement with ABN Amro in Australia and I was wondering if 
you have seen it ?

Also, Westpac have told me that the ISDA with them has been (finally) agreed, 
is this correct ?

Regards,

Shane
