Our legal specialist is Sara Shackleton and she can be reached on 713 853 
5620.  I have let her know that your legal council will be contacting her 
regarding documentation on the partnership agreement and the assignment of 
the ISDA from the corporation to the LP.   I shall contact you, as agreed, 
next monday to discuss next steps regarding the proposed $345/t three year 
linerboard - OCC spread trade.

Thankyou for your interest,

Best regards,

Stephen Klein
