Attached is a revised proposal sheet and swap confirmation for the captioned 
underlying partnership interest.  The notional value has been changed in 
both, and EGF has been added as a business unit to the proposal.  The prior 
valuation did not include the SLP/Chewco interest that is covered by the 
swap.  Hopefully, this will correct any confusion. 

Julia Chin should substitute the following for the hard copies previously 
provided to her.  If you have any questions, please advise.  Mary Cook
