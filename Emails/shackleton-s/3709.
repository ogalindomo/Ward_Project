Hi Stuart & Laurel,

Enron metals buys 700 million yen 2-dec-00 @ 104.35

Laurel, I apologize but it is probably a better idea if Dart or someone from 
your area enter trades into infinity until I am completely sure  that my 
updates are saved over terminal server. This will be my priority tomorrow. I 
will fax confirm tickets to 713-646-3740

The 15-20 thousand p&l should get booked under Enron Global Markets Japan 
{ask Gary about entity booking}

Take care & thanks,
Darren
