Theresa, 

Mark Sagel at Psytech Analytics agreed to all of the changes I recommended 
and sent a signed copy of the Service Agreement to me this afternoon.  Thus, 
the Agreement is ready for Sheila's signature for execution.  I am sending 
two initialed copies down to you.  Call me to confirm receipt.
