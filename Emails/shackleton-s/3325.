Hi Sara!

Please give us a call as your trip grows closer. Schedule permitting (we just 
had a baby girl nine days ago, and crush activity may still be petty
crazy!), we'd love to get together. Also, please let us know if we can help 
you with any recommendations while you're here.

All the best,

Scott & Martha Wright
