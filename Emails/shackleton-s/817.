I received the bylaws this morning and forwarded them to Utah counsel (who is 
in NY).  Left 2 messages with his office.  Have not heard from him.  I'll 
call again.  SS

I have requested Deseret's bylaws from David Crabtree.  Our Utah counsel will 
review and call tomorrow.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Sara
