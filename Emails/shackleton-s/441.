Subject: ECT Canada to Enron Canada Corp. Name Change

Please be advised that effective Wednesday, September 1, 1999, our new legal 
name will be changed from "Enron Capital & Trade Resources Canada Corp." to 
"Enron Canada Corp.".  Commencing September 1, 1999, we will use this full 
legal name for all contracts, invoices, negotiable instruments and orders for 
goods and services.

For more informal business usage, we will be using "Enron Canada" or "ECC".

If you have any questions or concerns with respect to letterhead, e-mail 
addresses, business cards, etc., please contact Iris Wong.

Thanks, 
Greg
