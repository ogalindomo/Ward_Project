Thanks for your additional comments.  Attached are all the revised forms to 
put into your system.  The major concept addition is a partial termination 
right in the partnership and membership forms in the same format as the share 
swap form.  I will let you know (hopefully with some lead time!) when 
additional swaps are to be prepared for Raptor 2, 3, 4.
