I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in 
the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing 
agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

Thanks.
