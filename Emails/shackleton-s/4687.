Subject: Toronto Dominion (Texas), Inc. (EXISTING ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT)

Treasa:

Your diagram identifies "Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto".  
Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA 
agreement?  Did the bank change its name?

I'll wait for the term sheet and the draft TD confirms which you mentioned in 
your email.

Sara
