The legal contact for Buy Side Direct is Michael Minnich at 415-369-5016.

Lisa O'Connor, our business contact, suggested that comments / issues be 
forwarded to her as Michael is out of the office today.  Lisa's #s are 
415-369-5020 (phone) and 415-369-5021 (fax).  Could you please copy me on any 
communication ?  

The clearing firm will be Weiss Peck & Greer, an affiliate / sub of 
Rabobank.  Lisa confirmed that the clearing firm will be the counterparty for 
all trades, allowing trading on an anonymous basis.  Lisa was not sure if the 
current agreement acknowledges the clearing firm's obligations in the event 
of a failed trade.  

I will review the document and call / email you with my comments shortly.

Thanks.

Mike
