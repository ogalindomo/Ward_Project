Jay,

Attached is a sample Annex B and B-1 for a U.S. corporate entity.  We have 
set up the sample showing only the Counterparty providing credit, including 
provisions for a guaranty, and assuming that cash and letters of credit are 
both eligible collateral.  Please check with legal before sending out a 
sample, as occassionally our forms and provisions change.

Call us if you have any questions.

Stephanie
