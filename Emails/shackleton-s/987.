Subject: Revised Ghost Swap Documents



I attach the swap confirmation and schedule, marked against the versions 
previosly circulated.

The amendments reflect:

1.  The relevant provisions of the August Citibank Revolver

2.  The fact that Enron Corp. is now the direct swap counterparty.

3.  Comments from Enron in-house counsel. In particular, I am told that a 
simplified payment provision is now generally being used in the swap confirm 
(see Section 2)

Please call with any questions or comments.
