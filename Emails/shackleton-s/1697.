Sara,
Maybe every other week.... or when we have a specific agenda item we want to 
cover in between (e.g. debt confirmations).
I would include Laurel who is probably impacted more than anyone.

Subject: Lotus Notes

I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.  The 
initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other 
Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.  On a slightly different 
note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review 
work in progress, issues, products, etc.?  If so, who should be included?  
Thanks.  Sara
