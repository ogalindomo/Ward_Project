Due to options outstanding for Catalytica that have a separate value from the 
preferred shares that we already carry, we have created two Raptor proposal 
sheets for the assets.  One for the Catalytica options and one for the 
preferred shares.

Please review the following documents and let me know if you have any 
questions.
