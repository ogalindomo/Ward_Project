Hello everyone.

I know you will get tired of these emails, but There are several deals that 
are way overdue.  

There are two tabs - Legal and Credit.  

Legal:  If you need a worksheet, please let Credit know.  I have highlighted 
several deal dates in red that are dated back to May 23, 2000.

Credit:  If these deals are not ready to go out, if you can just drop me an 
informal email about the reason (s) for the delay.

Thanks,

Sheetal :)
