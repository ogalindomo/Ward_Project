Oliver,

A quick question regarding Fortum Gas Ltd.  How have you established this 
entity as an eligible contract party?  Do you have a financial statements or 
a guaranty?  I am trying to validate them to trade financially with ENA, but 
legal is asking for proof they meet eligibilty standards.

Please advise,

thanks
brant
