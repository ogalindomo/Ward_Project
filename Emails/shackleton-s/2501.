Dear Florencia:

Attached are resolutions which we request that you prepare for the captioned 
company to adopt.  Please send me a draft of the resolutions once you have 
put them in the proper form for signature.  If you need help coordinating the 
proper signatures, please contact me or Rafael Rangel.

Please contact me at 713-646-6197 should you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks very much for your help.

Nancy
