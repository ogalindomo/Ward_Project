The enclosed doc contains two clauses from our ISDA schedule that I feel 
would need to be substantively revised for ag products.  There are a few 
other suggested changes I have as well (e.g. footnote references w/ 
instructions on drafting).  Finally, there are some conceptual points that I 
believe should be discussed w/ relation to the unique structure for "softs" 
trading we have been planning.

I will ask my assistant to schedule a 30-min. meeting with the four of us for 
sometime next week.  -- Bob
