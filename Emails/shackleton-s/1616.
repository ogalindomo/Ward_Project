"Following Business Day Convention" means the convention for adjusting any 
relevant date if it falls on a day that is not a Business Day (when 
commercial banks settle payments is USD in N.Y., for our purposes) to the 
first following day that is a Business Day or a trading day for the relevant 
floating price source.  I hope I have given you a simple description.

Sara,

Patti Melcher, ENA's counterparty in the swap, called to ask me for a 
definition of the "Following Business Day Convention" referenced on page 2 of 
her confirmation.  I had not received my copy of ISDA yet, and so could not 
answer the question.  Would you mind forwarding back to both of us?

Thanks & regards,
Davis Thames
