I have asked that you be placed on the distribution list--the system is down, 
or I would attach copies of the other documents; however, we expect new 
drafts from A&K tonight and I do not think it would be profitable for you to 
review the drafts we have of the other documents, unless you have a lot of 
free time on your hands (which I doubt).

Please make sure that I am on the distribution list for ALL documentation.  I 
only have the swap confirm/schedule.  Thanks.  Sara
