Spoke with Joe Manogue this morning. He has been speaking to their external 
council (S&S) daily trying to get a lined draft of the document with all 
changes. He was supposed to get it last Friday, is now promised it this 
morning. He plans to review and fax it out to you this afternoon, following 
up with a hard copy by Fedex overnight. He's doing all he can to speed the 
process along. I'll call you when I hear more from him. Per
