Subject: SITA (French company)

Hey, guys:  I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England 
and Wales.  I believe that Michael drafted originally.

(1)  submission to English courts and waiver of all objections

(2)  setoff  for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or 
Tax Event Upon Merger

Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?

Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal 
Tuesday,  Nov. 7.


Thanks.  Sara
