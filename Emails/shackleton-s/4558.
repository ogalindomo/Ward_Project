THIS E-MAIL SUPERSEDES THE PREVIOUS E-MAIL WITH HAWAII I FACILITY AGREEMENT 
ATTACHED.

Attached are the Hawaii I and Hawaii II Facility Agreements.  I have attached 
a clean draft of both facility agreements, as well as a copy marked to show 
changes in each facility agreement against the existing Amended and Restated 
Facility Agreement for Hawaii 125-0.

Please call me if you have any trouble accessing these documents.
