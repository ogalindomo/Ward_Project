Joe and Gary,
We have worked with Susan Musch, Tax Department, to get an appropriate 
Service agreement in place between Enron Japan (EJC) and Enron North America 
(ENA).  The agreement will allow the independant contractor (EJC) to execute 
trades for ENA.  EJC will be compensated by charging ENA 105% of expenses 
incurred.  
I will have Gary sign and send both orginals to Joe Hirl for signature.

Please do not hesitate to call Darren, Susan or myself if questions.
Thanks, Sheila
