Subject:  MSA Perez

Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.

I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
matter.

keep you posted.
