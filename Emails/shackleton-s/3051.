Sara,

Further to our telephone conversation last week, I would be grateful if you 
could
let me have your comments on the revised draft ISDA documentation sent 
through to
you.

We are very keen to finalise the ISDA and CSA as soon as possible next week. I
look forward to hearing from you.

Regards
Megan Duffill
