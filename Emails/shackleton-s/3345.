Sara,

Did you ever hear from Sarah Wesner regarding setting up some lines of credit 
for Darren's futures trading in Japan?  This trading will be done as Enron 
Japan, not ENA, so we cannot use the existing agreements.  Please let me know 
what I may need to do so we can make sure everything is set up for Darren.  
Thanks!
