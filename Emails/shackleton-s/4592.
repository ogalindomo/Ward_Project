Sara,

1. Bank of America uses ADP, a third party, to process al of its trades.  
BofA indicated that ADP process trades for "75% of Wall Street" and that they 
have confidentiality agreements in place with ADP.

2. BofA also uses a statement vendor to process account statements.  Again, 
BofA indicated that they have confidentiality agreements in place with such 
vendor.

Suggested language -    "Clearing Broker may disclose Confidential 
Information to third parties to the extent necessary to facilitate orders and 
to perform its services and obligations hereunder"

Let me know what you think.
