Subject: Scheduling a time to talk about the ABN/AMRO margin agreement


Sara, could we schedule a time to talk about the margin loan agreement and
the form of guaranty? I can do it anytime tommorrow (Friday) afternoon.
Kris will not be on the call. I would like to see what points we can
resolve before we resort to the business people. Thanks.
