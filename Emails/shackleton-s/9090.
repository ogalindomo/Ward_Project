Per our conversation, attached is the Schedule to the Master Agreement and 
Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex.  You should have received or be 
receiving by fax the preprinted ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support 
Annex.

Please call either myself at 713-345-3249 or Sara Shackleton at 713.853.5620
