Subject: Deal execution




A few minutes ago Scott Neal spoke to Claudio Majul from C. Puerto and 
executed the swap.
Puerto is now waiting for the confirmation.

Sara, let's work on the terms of the confirmation, and once ready send it to 
Scott for him to fax it to Puerto.

If anyone has questions pls. call me

Julian
