Just a short note to let you know that the resolution authorizing equity 
derivative trades was passed by the board last week.  Jim Armogida just 
confirmed this to me.  So, moving forward, Enron Corp (not ENA) should be the 
counterparty in all of our trades.  As a result, we should move forward with 
negotiating an ISDA with Lehman and others ASAP.
