That is wonderful.  However my Prime Broker contact at Bear has still not 
been advised of the pending changes.  It would seem to me it will still take 
time for Bear to make the adjustment to the account.

This will likely delay getting the margin relief we so desperately need.

Could you please confirm that they are ready to fully enact the agreement and 
lower the margin requirements as of tomorrow?

Thanks,

Tom
