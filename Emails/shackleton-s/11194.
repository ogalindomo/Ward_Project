I got a call from Jason Williams on this file.  As it turns out, in his 
review of the annual report of Welch he noted that it stated that Welch is a 
cooperative.  The original draft of the ISDA was not drafted with this 
knowledge as there was no indication from any source that Welch was a 
cooperative.  This fact needs to be confirmed, and if Welch is a cooperative, 
you will need to research the issue.  I attach for you a letter of issues  
sent to outside counsel last year when we were investigating another proposed 
cooperative counterparty.  Hope this will help.




Cordially,
