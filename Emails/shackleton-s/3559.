Pursuant to our conversation of today, attached are the form of swaps we 
developed for shares and warrants.  These can be used as a basis for the 
development of forms for the other types of equity investments which will be 
subject to additional swaps.  As I obtain the source information evidencing 
the different types of equity investments I will fax the materials to you.  
Thus far I know we will need swaps for (a) LLC membership interests, (b) LP 
partnership interests, (c) "income participation certificates."  As I 
mentioned, the valuation commercial department is working on "Final Price" 
language evidencing how a valuation will be conducted for these various 
equity investments on any Valuation Date. 



Please feel free to call with questions.  As I mentioned, we would like to 
have the forms developed by mid next week.  Thank you for your attention to 
these matters.   Mary
