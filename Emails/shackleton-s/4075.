Sara,

Since you're out the rest of the week from noon tomorrow, we'd really 
appreciate it if you could prepare a revised confirm tomorrow morning so we 
can deliver it to LJM for their review. Then, we can hopefully sign the 
confirm on Monday. Thanks!

Scott

Subject: re: Raptor II Swap

Here are comments from transaction support group on the LDC swap.  I have 
marked my changes against a clean version of the latest swap.
