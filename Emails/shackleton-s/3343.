hi sara -- i hope your weekend was great!  i had a pretty nice and quiet 
one.  kinda difficult to get used to working now.

i remember that in the EITF meetings, you mentioned that ENA has a broad 
approval to enter into all derivative transactions.  do you mind faxing a 
copy to me (713 853 9252)?  i am working on the follow-on condor offering.  
we expect that part of that second offering will be in euros and we will 
likely have enron enter into a currency swap with the indenture trustee.  
counsel for the investment banks are asking about who has authority to sign 
what documents.

i appreciate your help!!
