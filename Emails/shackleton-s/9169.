Hi,

As I mentioned most of the liquids' traders do have brent books set up and 
are able to trade brent.

The main ones are:

Bill White  Oil-Brent-Price
Spencer Vosko  Phyoil-Price



Other traders include Pavel Zadorozhny, Mario De La Ossa, Rob Fuller, John 
Wilson, Phil Clifford.

Thanks,
Shifali
