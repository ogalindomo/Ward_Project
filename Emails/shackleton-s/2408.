Sara,

to clarify--all of our FX trades are being done with J. Aron and Company.  
(That is how they are being booked on the CP side)  

All interest rate swaps are with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets.

Repos/bonds are with Goldman Sachs & Co. 

Previously we had been sending out FX confirmations to Goldman Sachs & co., 
but we will now confirm all FX trades under the master with J. Aron.

Thanks.  

Of course, Stuart and Pushkar still write up all the tickets with Goldman 
SAchs.  But, I have asked Risk to be sure to book the trades to J Aron.
