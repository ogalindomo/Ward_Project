Attached is credit terms for Capex master trading contract (per Julian's 
request).



Andrea,

I hoped your credit questions were answered concerning adequately in the 
recent contract negotiations with Pluspetrol.  I apologize if I wasn't 
sufficiently responsive.  I'm working on unloading other responsibilities so 
that I can focus purely on Southern Cone.
