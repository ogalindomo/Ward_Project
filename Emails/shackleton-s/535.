Sara,
Stewart needs help with yet another ISDA situation.  It's gotten to the point 
where he's such an ISDA advocate that we are going to have to consider 
nominating him for Legal's prestigious  "Best With Legal Paper"  annual 
award.  Let me know if I can help in any way with this.--cgy

Stewart,

Sorry this has taken so long, however we have a copy of a draft ISDA that
our legal folks have developed. I would appreciate Enron's comments
regarding this, so if you could, please pass this on to the appropriate
people and get back to me.  Thanks.
