It's true!  I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!  I 
may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.  But I will call 
before the weekend.  Sara

Sara:

I have not heard from you in a while. Are you still checking your
emails? Maybe not, if I do not receive an answer or are you just real
busy. I sent you an email about the Gordon etc etc. duck lunch a while
back. Monty says hello, and asked if you "were still fine".
