Sara and team,

On February 5, 2001 I sent to Legal, copies of Enron Financial Confirms that 
were altered by Counterparties (AEP, NRG Power, Cargill-Alliant, NYSEG, 
Merchant Energy, Mirant, Constellation, Rochester).  Just checking the status 
of the various issues, and to see if you needed any further information 
pertaining to the documents.  If possible, can you please let us know who is 
handling the various Counterparties so we can go directly to the appropriate 
person with inquiries in the future.

Thanks for your help.
