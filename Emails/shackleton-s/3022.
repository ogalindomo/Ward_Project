Any luck with outside counsel on the issue of holding cash in Canada?

Tanya:

Have you followed up on our solution of sending cash in respect of our
credit requirements? (We are actually thinking that you could withhold a
couple of monthly payments to IPP (currently $680,000/month) in respect of
JDI's requirement. We would provide a letter approving this.)
