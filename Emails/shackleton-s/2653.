Hi Sara, sorry to keep bugging you.  Did you decide if the payment date was 
going to be 10 days?  Elsie Lew needs to bill someone by 3:00 today.  The 
paperwork we have says five days but the counterparty is insisting on 10 
days.  The amount of money they owe us is 28 million.  Let me know if you 
have made a decision on this issue.

Thank you!
Melissa
