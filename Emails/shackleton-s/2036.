Sara and Ann,
I have spoken with Morgan Stanley regarding opening up an account for Enron 
Investments PLC which is a  UK based company, and will receive UK shares on 
Settlement date, Tuesday, 5/30.  

We would like to have DVP delivery at Morgan on 5/30.  Therefore, we will 
need to fund the Morgan Stanley account with GBP on 5/50 for the settlement 
balance.  

Please call if questions. 
Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
Ketan said that you can call Sheung, 212-762-5232, to assist in getting the 
Morgan Stanley account set up.
