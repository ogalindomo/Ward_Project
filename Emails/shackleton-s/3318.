To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure.  Per John's message, he wants to trade 
as ECT Investments.  IF he were doing any heding activity for the Merchant 
assests portfolio, that trading would be as ENA, although, those trades may 
be done by David Vitrella and/or Selena.   Do you know if John will be able 
to trade as ECT Investments, or if a separate entity will have to be set up?
