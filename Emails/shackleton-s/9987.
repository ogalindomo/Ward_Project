Good Morning Sara and Kaye,

The following information is what we received from Samantha's family/pastor 
last night.

There will not be a wake for Taylor, however, there will be a viewing 
tomorrow, Thursday, March 22, 2001 at 10:00 a.m. and funeral services will be 
held at 11:00 a.m. at Greater Pure Light, MBC.  Directions (from downtown) 
are as follows:

Take 59N to Laura Koppe.  Take the Laura Koppe exit and make a right on Laura 
Koppe.  Take Laura Koppe to Homestead.  Make a left on Homestead and a quick 
right on Kelburn.  The address is 8802 Kelburn.

Samantha's Pastor (Pastor Broussard) informed us last night that due to the 
fact that the adoption had not been finalized, Taylor was not covered by any 
form of insurance.      

FYI:  Just in case you don't know, Samantha's husbands's name is Twalure Boyd.
