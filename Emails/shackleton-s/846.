There is a second set of EES Confirms which need our attention.

1. NE POOL

NE Pool is one of the points which  we didn't have language for until now.

I have attached a sample confirm with the new language and faxed a copy of 
the website page to you.

2. PJM

We will also be confirming PJM deals.

Since we used this language for PJM for the Enron Australia deal which we 
discussed in person
before, it is unlikely that this PJM language will need to be updated, but 
wanted to attach
that as well.
