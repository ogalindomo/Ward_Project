		 Subject: Enron Kids Holiday

With Christmas right around the corner, it is again time for the Enron Kids 
Holiday program!

This year, the Legal Department will be sponsoring 4 children from HISD 
Burrus Elementary School and providing them with a Christmas that they 
otherwise may not be able to have.

With your donations, these underprivileged children will enjoy a toy, book, 
coat, complete outfit and shoes wrapped and delivered to their school.

I sincerely hope that you will join Pat Radford, Laurie Mayer and me in 
making this holiday special for these children.

Donations will be accepted until Friday, December 1, 2000.

Thank you in advance for your participation.
