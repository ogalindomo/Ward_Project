Stephanie, from our end, we have executed a brokerage agreement between ECT 
and GSI.  I am forwarding to you the two originals to send back.  If 
possible, please put in the mail today since there is a huge rush on getting 
it back.

The fed ex envelope attached has the address.  Send to Sarah Stowey's 
attention.  

Please make sure that the accompanying documents are all there.  I asked 
Keegan to get Kate Cole's signatures for the Consent Form so please follow up 
to get that form from Keegan.

I will fax a copy of the executed versions to Sarah in London as per her 
request.
