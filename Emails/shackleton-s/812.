FYI.   Information Risk Management  ("IRM") is running a virus check on 
O:\Common\legal on a daily basis and it was reported this morning that  
during the last two days "no viruses" were identified.  

 IRM recommends that we do the following to protect against viruses:

Click on Start->run and type (or you can cut and paste):

"C:\Program Files\McAfee\virusScan NT\mcconsol.exe" click Okay

You will get a message from "Virus Scan NT Anti-virus Console" with a status 
report

When you get into the program, click on help and then about.  The screen 
should look like this:



If it doesn't, either call tech support and place a call, or log out properly 
at night.  

To log out properly, click on start->shut down and either restart the 
computer or close all programs and log on as a different user.  This will 
allow the computer to receive the proper version of the virus scan engine and 
dat file.
