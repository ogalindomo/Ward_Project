Sara,

Lehman is waiting on a notarized certificate as to the Enron Corp. corporate 
documents that were sent with the Master Agreement.  I thought we had sent 
them one, but they have not received it.  I have spoken to Kate Cole's office 
and she is going to put a rush on getting another notarized copy to me 
today.  I will fax it to Lehman's contact in Switzerland and send original 
via overnight delivery.
