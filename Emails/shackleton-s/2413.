Subject: Duke Energy Trading and Marketing L.L.C.

We have just completed a nightmare negotiation involving a confirmation with 
this counterparty and propose entering into an English law ISDA Master with 
them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence 
between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to 
the cp as a starter.  If you think that this would be appropriate please 
could you send me a copy of the Duke/ECT Schedule, CSA and any guaranties.

Have a great weekend.

Many thanks
Michael
