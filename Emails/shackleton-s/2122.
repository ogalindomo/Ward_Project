At the request of the CP, we would like to redraft the ISDA with the 
suggested tiered threshold structure (see attached credit worksheet).  Other 
credit terms (ie. guaranties) may need to be amended as described in the 
worksheet attached.  We will simultaneously be amending our exiting Master 
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement with a similar tiered threshold structure.  
If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.   
Regards, Ed Sacks
