For those of you involved in any Raptor equity investments out of JEDI I, I 
have been advised by Andrea Reed that Chewco Investments purchased a position 
in JEDI I.  Chewco is owned in part by an Enron entity.  The result is that 
Enron entities now have a 96.12% interest in JEDI I (60% ENA + 36.12% EGF 
based upon Chewco).  I hope this is helpful in your review of the Raptor 
matters.  The closing binders are in the file room for you to review if you 
need to verify the materials.   Thank you.  Mary
