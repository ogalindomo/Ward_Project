Cassandra, Cheryl and David,

Gary has requested that we establish new futures execution and clearing 
agreements with Solomon Smith Barney/Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.  I will 
forward the agreements when we receive them to Cheryl Nelson in Legal for 
review.

Prudential is exiting the business and the prior people at Pru have moved to 
SSB.  

Please do not hesitate to call, 3-3210,  if you have any questions.
Sheila
