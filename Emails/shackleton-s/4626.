Dave:

I sent an e-mail to legal asking for pro forma contracts.  That said, please 
try to get me financials ASAP as it might be more efficient to go directly to 
contracts depending on how things unfold.  Tracy Ngo is our credit person and 
Sara our lawyer on this one.  They are copied above.

Thanks!
