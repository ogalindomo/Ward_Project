Hi Stephanie, I will get the final version of ECT - Goldman International 
agreement by the end of the day  onThursday and there is a lot of pressure to 
get it executed right away.   Tomorrow can you prepare and execute the 
accompanying documents.  For ECT's Authorized Traders List, you need to add 
Mark Schlueter (doublecheck spelling and phone number) to the list of 
traders.  This is a HIGH priority.

Please also revise the the trader list for both the ENA (add Peter Schluter) 
and ECT  (add Mark) in order to execute the Deutsche Bank agreements we 
discussed today.   We also got calls today about getting this one executed  
since we already have signatures from Deutsche Bank.

Thanx.
