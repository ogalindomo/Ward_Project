Did we ever get any further on ECP issues related to ENA subs, i.e. ECTRIC 
business with Total International Ltd, an unsupported subsidiary of TotalFina.

I have left two emails with my contact regarding ECP issues, with no reply.  
What are our choices to do with trade v34062, a trade not yet confirmed with 
this customer.  I don't see this as a credit issue, but more of a legal 
issue.  From a credit standpoint, I am ok with the trade.

Adam - consider these guys on the No Trade list until we can finalize 
handling status.
