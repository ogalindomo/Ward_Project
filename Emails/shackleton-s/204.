Subject: Trading in Brazil

Greetings!  Hope there's no confusion about my role in Brazil.  I'm replacing 
Yao Apasu in the derivatives area and I thought he was more involved in the 
process than he apparently was.  I'll be taking direction from Brent and will 
be available as needed.  Thanks.  Sara
