FYI,  the ag group has decided to start holding regularly scheduled bi-weekly 
meetings, which is a great idea, as the group is growing -- a new vp of 
origination especially for ag deals has just been designated.

I am sure you won't be planning on attending these but, of course, you are 
certainly welcome to attend any of them.  The first one is Wednesday, Nov. 1 
1:30 p.m. in EB 30c2 -- after that they will be every other Monday at 1:30.
