Sara,

Below is a list (hopefully comprehensive) of intercompany counterparties we 
trade with, but do not have an RMT master agreement in place with:

Enron Metals Limited
Enron Metals Recycling
Enron Netherlands Holdings BV
Enron Development Funding limited
Enron Metals & Commodity Limited

LEt me know if  you need any more info.  

Recycling & Metals & Commodity Limited have very little trade activity.
