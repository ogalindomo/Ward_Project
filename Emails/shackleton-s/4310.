Julia, Sara, and Brent,
 I don't think I received the revised version of the swap that Brent
is commenting on, but Brent sent me a set.  Was there any change from the
last version I saw, which changed "increased" and "decreased" in the Initial
price paragraph, other than to add "or a direct or indirect equity interest
of," to the Termination Date paragraph?
 Sara, did you get my fax of suggested changes?  Should I send it
around to a wider group?
