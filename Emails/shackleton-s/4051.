I spoke to Lars, who then sent me this e-mail.  He will respond to me with 
specific comments on the EOL GTCs should Deutsche Bank wish to trade via EOL 
prior to the ISDA having been concluded.

Sara - I'd be grateful for an update on the ISDA - thanks

Justin

Subject: Deutsche Bank - Enron Online



Justin,

I just chased up the people that are negotiating the ISDA between Enron and 
Deutsche Bank and was told that this is nearing completion.

The person dealing with this at Enron is Sara Shackleton / based in Houston 
and you should be able to get a full update from her.

Regards
Lars
