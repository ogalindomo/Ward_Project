I am leaving the office early today (during lunch hour) as I am having some 
pretty bad allergic reactions.

There are a few things that were put in my inbox this morning that I have not 
gotten around to yet.  If you have left me with something that cannot wait 
until Monday, I can work on it at home if you can e-mail it to me.  My home 
e-mail is rebruce@houston.rr.com.  Also, Brenda has my cell phone number.
