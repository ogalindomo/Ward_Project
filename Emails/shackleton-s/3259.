The original documentation delivered in connection with the First Amendment 
to Indenture dated as of March 26, 1999 among Brigham Exploration Company, 
Chase Bank of Texas, Joint Energy Development Investments II Limited 
Partnership and ECT Merchant Investments Corp. has been removed from the 
Legal Dept. file room, although the empty file folder was left on the 
shelf.   Please check your office and return the contents of this file to me 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

We are having a penalty-free week for return of files.  Please help them find 
their way back to the file room.
