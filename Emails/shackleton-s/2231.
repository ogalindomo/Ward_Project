Subject: Gaza Intercreditor Agmt

Can you please have your lawyers look at this draft of the intercreditor 
agreement?  There are references to the hedging counter party as well as the 
ISDA Master Agreement.  We need to know if any of the language is 
objectionable so this document can be finalized next week.

Thanks,

JR
