Denis,

How are you doing?  Hope things are going well for you.

Are you working on the ISDA Master btw Enron and First Union?  Apparently,
it is still not complete and I am getting some heat on this end.  I would
appreciate it if you could give me an update.

Any word from Mr. Webster lately?  Every time I hear something about ML
London it sounds like chaos.

Take care.

Max
