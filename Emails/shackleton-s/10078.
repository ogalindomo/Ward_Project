Sara, 

Further to your e-mail to Justin re equity trading in the UK, I would be 
grateful if you could let me know whether you would be free to have a 
conference call this Friday 30 March @ 3.00 p.m. London time.   If this is 
not convenient, please suggest an alternative time.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, 
Nicola
