Citibank has requested that we send them our confirmation so they can verify 
notional amounts, rates and the like.  I have prepared a confirmation, 
updating our form to include the suggested language in the EMTA template 
(included in the fax I sent you yesterday)  

Please have a look and let me know if you need any changes.
