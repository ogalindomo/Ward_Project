I spoke to Sheila yesterday and she will be joining the call. I'll ask her to 
give you a call about Japan

Jonathan

Hello London, this is Bob Bruce -- I will be joining Sara on the conference 
call you have scheduled for Friday (3/27).

If Sheila Glover is still in London, I think her participation in the call 
would be very valuable if she is available.

p.s.  if either of you run across Sheila prior to the call, could you ask her 
to call me re Japan?  thanks, Bob
