Attached are four resumes which have not yet been scanned into our recruit 
tracking software.  Tammy Kemp is an internal candidate; Jeannette Blanchette 
and Stephanie Granado were referred by Debra Perlingiere; and Tammy Brown has 
been referred by Theresa Zucha.   I will also be sending you some other 
candidates who have actually posted for the position.   Please let me know 
when you are avialable to begin interviewing and whom you would like to see.





Thanks,
Molly
