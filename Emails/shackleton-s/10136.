Good Morning Sara,

Thank you again for reviewing the Equity Swap ISDA Confirmation the other 
day. They now want to capture the trades in question as a basket equity swap. 
I have modified the confirmation to accommodate the basket and included Annex 
I. Please review and advise if any changes should be made. 

Thanks!
