Sara advised you were working a project re McGarret/Hawaii125.  I will 
forward emails I got today related to same shortly.  There also seems to be a 
"Tahiti" deal which is tracked off of Hawaii.  I have captured the Raptor III 
docs which Carol forwarded from VE.  Raptor II is closed.  I guess III is 
another cookie cutter of I and II.  Do you want Sara or I to look over Raptor 
III?  Maybe Sara, you and I should convene to discuss how we will handle all 
of this.  Mary
