Good Morning Sara,

Question- When we do a back to back trade with London "Enron Credit .Com" ( 
i.e. London negotiates the trade, ENA documents the trade with the street, we 
back to back the trade to London), shouldn't the confirmation between London 
and ENA be in the name of Risk Managment rather than ENA?

I understand that London technically should not be doing any trades in the 
name of ENA. Until the issue is resolved to satisfy the legal and tax issues, 
London is operating in this fashion. Please advise once you establish the 
official ruling of what is acceptable to keep us in compliance.

Have a great day!

Jorge
