Stephanie, we have these documents executed from our end.  Please make sure 
that they go out asap because we have been holding the signed copies for a 
while.

While you were out , I doublechecked them and we have everything correct and 
ready to go.   I am not sure whether they should be returned back to Brian 
Coad in Dallas (214-515-4400) or to Terry Finn in Baltimore (410-895-3602).  
When you find out, please update in lotus notes.

I have faxed copies of the documents to Brian today.
