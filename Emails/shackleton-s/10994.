Maricela has requested a copy of the termination notice for the referenced 
swap.  I advised her that you would have done the document in relation to the 
swap (of which I think there was only one).  I cannot remember if it was ever 
terminated.  Can you coordinate this matter with Maricela.  I am covering the 
rest of the Raptor requests.

Cordially,
