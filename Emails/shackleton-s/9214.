Hi Sara:

I heard about a group called "Looking at Art", and they are going to
Marfa, Texas to check out the art colony there. I remembered that you
had gone there a couple of times and enjoyed it. The most important
thing about the conversation to me was that it reminded me that I had
not heard from you in a while. I am sure that you are very busy, but I
wanted you to know that I hoped things are going well with you and that
you get a chance to kick back some soon. Probably because that is what I
want to do.

Take Care,

Carson
