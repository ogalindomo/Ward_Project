Jason,

Thank you for the revised draft and for the amendments you made.  As we
discussed in our last conversation, I needed to more fully review the issue
of letters of credit being posted as Eligible Credit Support.  I have done
so and had some additional comments as a result.  In addition, there were
some other items that I asked to be amended that weren't addressed.  I
thought it would be easier for me to just blackline your draft rather then
sending you a list of comments (see attached).  Perhaps we can use this
draft as a basis for a discussion of the remaining open items.

I will be leaving for vacation on Wednesday afternoon.  If you've had a
chance to prepare, we can talk before then.  If not, then we can pick this
up after I return on August 7th.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Suanne
