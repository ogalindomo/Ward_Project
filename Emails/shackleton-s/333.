I will be flying back with you and I will arrange for a car from the 
airport.

Finalizing flight plans here.  Will you be flying to B.A. with us from Sao 
Paulo? If so, will you arrange for transportation from the airport?  My 
assistant Kaye should have our flight info and can coordinate with you.  
Thanks.  

It looks as though Andrea B. is coordinating with the business people and 
outside counsel.
