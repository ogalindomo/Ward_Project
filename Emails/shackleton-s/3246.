Good Morning,

FYI, Mark has asked me to set appointments for Thursday, 8/31,  allowing at 
least 30 minutes (45 max)  per review.  Please let me know, as soon as 
possible, if the this schedule creates a conflict for you.

New hires (Bob Bruce, Mary Cook, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie Panus) are being 
excluded from the mid-year process, but will be included in the Year-End 
process.


Best regards,
Taffy Milligan
