Here is a sample announcement for our next Credit/Legal Seminar:

Please plan on attending our second in a series of Credit/Legal seminars.  
This seminar will be held on  Thursday, March 22nd, from 2:00 - 3:30 p.m. in 
EB49c3 and will start out with a continuation of our first session which 
covered Credit issues raised in the ISDA Master Agreement and Omnibus General 
Terms and Conditions.  We will then continue the meeting with new 
information.  Please e-mail my assistant, Becky Spencer, if you are unable to 
attend.

Let me know of any revisions so I can send this out soon since our next 
session is next week (March 22nd).
