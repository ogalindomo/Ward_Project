Sheila, as per our conversation on Friday, I was out sick from the 15th 
through the 22nd therefore I was not able to turn back to my review of this 
Agreement until today.  

I completed the review this morning and have sent the comments to my 
assistant to type.  Therefore, we should have comments to forward by the end 
of the day today.
