This is message no. 2 from me.

Mark has clarified to me that:

1) The initial structure, in terms of what John Greene desires (in order to be
'up & running' as soon as possible) is to use the structure described in the
letter drafted by Jacqueline Hamilton (which John will convey to you directly
internally, per Mark Freeman's representation to me), where he will be a 
direct
employee of the U.S. entity which is already a client of Instinet in the U.S.

2) Once Enron decides on the longer-term corporate structure which they wish 
to
use in the future, subject to our concurrence, we will 'transition' from the
state originally desired by John Greene.

This is my and Mark Freeman's comprehension at present.  If you have any other
concerns or variance in comprehension which you wish to raise, please don't
hesitate to e-mail or call in return.

Kind regards/
