Subject: New FX deal tickets

After evaluating our current FX trading requirements and after consulting 
with  traders (Pushkar, Stuart, & Darren), I have found that the current FX 
ticket is not meeting our needs.  

Attached is the new FX trade ticket that will assist the desk facilitate the 
processing  of FX trades ( I hope!).

Unless there are violent objections out there, (let me know asap) Laura is 
currently ordering 1000 sheets of this new ticket.
