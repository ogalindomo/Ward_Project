Attached are my comments to the transfer agt.  I think it makes sense to 
attach the form of each side letter to the agreement for clarity.

I have just gotten off the phone with Lauren and Ken Blasko.  There were 
minor comments to LOC Facility that have been faxed to ABN Amro.  We expect 
that ABN Amro will execute the LOC shortly as soon as they pick up the fax.

The LOC will be sent to Lauren.  If there are no further commetns to the 
various contracts, we shoudl be prepaerd to exchange signature pages upon 
conclusion of the LOC Facility.  Lauren will send the LOC together with the 
Side Letters to Enron and Kate.

Lauren is the ALlegheny point person.  Pls direct all correspondence to her.  
Locke, should signature pages be sent to you as well as to Kate?

Janice and Sara, to whose attention and which number should all 
correspondence be directed?

Thank you all for your cooperation and help in moving this toward closing.
