Keegan, can you make a copy of a portion of this file for me for each of the 
abovementioned colleagues?

Marie, in response to your note about Morgan-ECI, as per my earlier email to 
you and Stephanie, I generally do not keep copies of brokerage agreements we 
send out or receive back, Stephanie does.  With few exceptions, I give all 
brokerage related documents to Stephanie to send out and to receive back. So 
please check with the file cabinet behind Stephanie for other copies.
