I talked with Brent this morning.  It appears that his daughter does not have 
appendicitis.  She has been running a fever, her white count was down, and 
she had fluid collecting in her abdominal area.  The doctors were baffled as 
to where this fluid was coming from.   As of this morning, Brent's daughter 
is showing signs of improvement; her white count is better and her fever is 
going down.  Doctors now think she has some kind of infection that is running 
its course.    Brent will know more later today when he speaks to the doctors 
about test results.
