Carol, enclosed please find proposed revisions to ISDA Schedule Part 6 -- the 
revisions would incorporate the 2000 Supplement to the 1993 Commodity 
Derivatives Definitions.  I have also enclosed a brief memo from me to Sara 
discussing the revisions.

The revisions do not seek to substantively change Part 6 (e.g., we are not 
seeking to change the "Disruption Fallbacks" or their priorities).  The 
revisions simply acknowledge the 2000 Supplement and make the terminology 
consistent.
