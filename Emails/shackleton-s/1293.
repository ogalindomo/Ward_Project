Subject: General Mills - Conference Call - 9:30a.m. Friday

Are you two available for a conference call with General Mills Friday morning 
at 9:30a.m to discuss ISDA schedule/credit annex?? 

I will be traveling Friday and may not be able to call in - no big loss!!!

Please let me know if this time will work so I can confirm with General Mills.
