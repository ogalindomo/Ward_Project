Sara:  Thanks for your message;   I have not received any fax relating to 
this issue (perhaps you sent it to Jim--if so, I will get it from him).  Any 
contractual language that affects our equity securities is high on my list of 
priorities;  I am usually surprised and disappointed at the lack of expertise 
that I see from the banks' counsel in this area (also their lack of concern 
for our issues).  As soon as Jim forwards to me what you sent to him, I will 
take a look at it.  As always, thanks for your help.  Regards, Rex.

Subject: Lehman Bros. "puts"

Jim and Rex:

The Lehman Bros. form of "put" works fine from a legal perspective.  
Yesterday, I faxed to you one of the "puts" with underlined language 
reflecting differences in securities language from our prior swap/forward 
deals with Lehman.  The differences may be alright for purposes of the "puts".

Please let Jeff know if the "puts" are acceptable for execution (from the 
securities perspective).  I have already initialed the documents from the 
swap perspective.  Let me know if you have any questions.

As usual, thanks for your help.
