		 Subject: HSES ISDA from Jim Piccone


Attached is our revision to the draft ISDA schedules for the HSES/Enron ISDA 
with changes marked.  My approach was simply to make changes consistent with 
the HS Resources ISDA other than items specific to their different credit 
status.  Please call me with any comments or questions.
