Steve,
When entering deals for Willamette, the buy price in Enpower needs to be the 
sell price minus transmission. This basically allows Willamette to be flat 
against our book.  We then receive an annuity from Willamette at the end of 
the month.  If you have questions, please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
