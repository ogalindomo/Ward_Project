Don't forget to let me know if you are interested in attending the new hire 
dinner at 6pm on Thursday, April 26th! It will be held at Oritalia at the 
Westin Hotel. Please indicate your meal selection (meat--beef, or 
veggie--pasta). I will need to submit final entree numbers Thursday morning.

Thanks,
Grace
