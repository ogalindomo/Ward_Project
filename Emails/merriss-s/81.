Group,
I have purchased 8 mws from the service desk for Tuesday (04/10) in SP-15.  
We bought 8 mws from a service customer through the APX.  I have made the 
entries into CAPs for the purchase from APX.  I have inc'd load in ST-WBOM.  
Load will need to be dec'd and the energy sold off. You may want to  combine 
it with EES(or buy some mws to make it a whole piece to sell) and use NCPA to 
move it North.  Or maybe export it at Silverpeak.  The schedule is as 
follows.  8 mw, HE 1-24 on 04/10 in SP-15.  The price is $150 peak, and $100 
off peak.  Purchase from Services is #574640, and purchase from APX is 
#574629.  Please make any buy-resales and sales under ST-WBOM. 
Please call with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill
