Just a reminder, below are the deadlines for filing benefit claims for 
expenses incurred during 2000.

For flexible spending accounts (health, dependent and transportation), the 
deadline is April 30, 2001.
For medical and dental, the deadline is December 31, 2001.
The deadline for the vision plan expenses is six months following the date of 
service.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thanks!
