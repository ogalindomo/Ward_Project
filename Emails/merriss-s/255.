The original schedule was 50 MW's TEP GEN @PV(EPE XCHANGE) - EPMI - 
SRP-MIRANT-CISO(T)PVD/SP15.  Mirant was cut by the CISO 25 mw HE 1-6,   8 mw 
HE 23, and  25 mw HE 24.  Please refer to Mirant tag #3316 for this revised 
schedule.   Mirant owes us a sink for 25mw HE 1-6, 8mw HE 23, and 25mw HE 24 
and has decided to provide the sink on a real-time basis.   Please check with 
Mirant to assure they have a sink for these hours.   Please check out with 
TEP when you are aware of the new sink.
   

Thanks 
Stacy
