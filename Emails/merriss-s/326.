Steve and David,

This morning APS lost FC#5.  This outage should have appeared in the night 
note and should have been mentioned in the shift change.  Where possible the 
cause of the outage and ETR should be noted.  This was important information 
for the SW traders as well as for the real-time trader coming on shift and it 
did not get communicated as it should have.
Please leave as much information concerning your shift as you can.

Thanks,
Bill
