Hello, Climbers-- 

The weather looks promising for Friday.? However, with all the new snow on 
top of last week's melt crust, the potential for avalanche is a concern.? I 
intend to start up the hill no matter.? If conditions appear to be dangerous, 
we'll have 2 options: turn around, or modify our route (and go up the south 
side).? Think about it. 

I'm bringing a shovel.? We could probably use at least one more.? I intend to 
bring avalanche transceivers from the club, so please remember to bring a 
couple AA batteries. 

Last, I'm looking for a ride. I live downtown near the Doubletree.? If you 
can give me a ride, let me know, and I'll give you directions.? Thanks.
