"Dawn Doucet	06/26/2000 09:51 AM		 		 To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT		 cc: 		 Subject: New Hire/TorontoHi Michelle, we've finished our due diligence on John Guerriero from Duke."
I didn't speak to his references but Paul DeVries did and he and Rob Milnthorp are both satisfied that there were no earlier occurrences of the legal situation that is unfolding now (or other signs of incompetence or lack of judgement).
John is being courted by several companies right now and they want to get an offer to him today.
Just wanted to let you know where we were on this one....
