"Peter,I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized workforce."; 1;
"I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a deadline of 12/15."; 1;
"Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues."; 1;
You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there are employees and unions from my clients in HR.; 1;
That makes me and the legal department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service for Enron.; 1;
Please provide me with information about this deal asap.; 1;
"And, I repeat my request to get me involved earlier on future deals."; 1;
Thank you.; 0;
