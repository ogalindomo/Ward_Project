Hello.
Do you think this should be included in our consulting agreement form?

"Aside from other legalissues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent yearsis the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question underwhat circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractorsentitled to employee benefits provided by  an employer to its employees."
"While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address thisissue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contractfor services."
"Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be includedin such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not beentitled to employee benefits."
"I thought you might have an interest in this,so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for thiscircumstance along with an analysis."
I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreementswho would be interested in receiving this information?
