Subject: Employment Agreement Language

Michelle,

We found another change for the employment agreement language.  The reference 
to the full name of the Admin Committee should read "the Administrative 
Committee of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the 
Enron Corp. Board of Directors."  

Thanks,
Courtney
