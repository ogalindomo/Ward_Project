"As background, I have been at EECC since October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic investment transactions."
"Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects."
"Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc."
"), m & a work, and securities offerings."
Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from vacation (my extension is 6-6127).
