Great.  Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday 
night.  If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.  It is 
Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.  I understand 
if you don't want to join us, though.  Ballet isn't for everyone.  Let me 
know.  Michelle
