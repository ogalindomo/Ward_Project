Subject: Due Diligence

We have completed the benefits portion of the due diligence report on Project 
Canary.  The highlighted portions require additional information and 
documentation.  As per our discussion yesterday, there are numerous questions 
regarding Compensation in the Benefits section.  It is my understanding that 
Compensation is responding to those issues.  If you have any questions or if 
we can be of assistance, please let us know.
