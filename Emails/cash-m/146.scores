My apologies!!!
I sent invitations to the Thursday afternoon meeting but failed to change the meeting time to 4:30 p.m..
"Please calendar the meeting in Conference Room EB3824 for 4:30 p.m., not 9:00 a.m. as shown on the meeting invitation."
This is the first time I've set a meeting this way.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
