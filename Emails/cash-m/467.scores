Bad news girls:I just got a call from Pam's secretary who let me know that Pam's brotherRuss was killed in a car accident last week.
Pam and I were supposed tohave lunch this week and she called to fill me in.
I don't know many of thedetails yet because her secretary did not know much.
Apparently they are having a military service in Seattle and they willprobably bury him in Texas since Pam's parents are moving to Texas soon.
Idon't know when the service in Texas will be.
Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers because I know that this isgoing to be terribly hard for her.
She and Russ were very close.
