"Hi, Linda."
"I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too."
"I was out on vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week."
I hope that ELM has received the response by now.
Let me know if I need to do anything else.

"Unfortunately, this issue with Eddie Lynn Morgan is still alive."
I talked with Kim a few weeks ago and she mentioned that she sent her write-up to you for your review - before sending it to Eddie Lynn.
Do you have a status update on when it will be ready to go to Eddie Lynn?
Thanks Michelle!

Perhaps now you can see my continued frustration with the lack of response to what I consider to be a very serious matter.
"As you had suggested when we first talked, I would appreciate it if you would forward this to Kim's boss so that I can get a response."

"As you indicated, she had not had an opportunity to provide you with the final outcome of the email investigation."
She apologizes for this and will have a write up to you within 1 week from today.
Let me know if you don't receive it by next Wednesday.
thanks.
