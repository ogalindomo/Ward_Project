"Both of these firms have contractors available now, so as soon as we get these agreements in place we can bring them in and put them to work."
"If possible, I'd like any agreement we put in place to be flexible enough to allow us to use other contractors in the future besides those we currently have identified."
"If you need me to do anything else or if you are not the right person to talk to, please let me know."
Thanks.
