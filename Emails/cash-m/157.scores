Each Data Protection Supervisory Authority can be contacted; some mayreview.
We are not aware of one supervisory authority that can bind allauthorities in all states with its approval of a contract.
"But if you arenot required by law to pre-submit your contract, I question whether you wantto do so."
You may get multiple interpretations.
"We believe that you shoulddevelop your best judgment about whether your documents conform to the legalrequirements and submit the contract where you are required to do so, notseek advice from the regulatory authorities about the specifics of yourcontracts."
"After all, as we indicated this area of the law is still influx, and we would hate to see you lock into a position with anauthority--unless you absolutely had to do so."
