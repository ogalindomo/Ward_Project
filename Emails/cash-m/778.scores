There are no rules restricting the use of such testing in Japan and it isbecoming more common.
"However, it is still likely to viewed askance by potential employees above acertain level, e.g."
"those being hired as director, or because of their standingin the business community."
This is probably the same as for similar levelemployees in other countries.

"In general, we try to avoid any type of personality/psych testing becauseof issues relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibitspre-employment medical testing."
It does apply to US citizens working forEnron in foreign locations (i.e.
extraterritorially).
"Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertainthe purpose/goal of the tests."
Why do they want this information?
"Isthere another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g.,references from prior employers, etc.)?"
"As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues thataddress this type of activity as well."
I suggest that we obtain theinformation above as well as the opinion requested below and then determinehow to proceed.

The outcome of the testing is a confidential report that comesto me (as HR) and I then send to the participant(s) in the recruitmentdecision making process for their confidential consumption.
"PDI haveagreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance asto our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product."
Canyou review the attached and come back to me with your thoughts?
"I wouldalso appreciate a local (Japan) opinion on the legal issues associated withabilities/psych testing prior to employment (I know you guys shy away fromit in the US although it is quite widely accepted ""down under"")."
