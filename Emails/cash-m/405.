Hoyt,

I have reviewed the attached.  I think it looks good.  It strikes the balance 
of welcoming and also letting them know that changes will occur in the 
future.  Kriste, any other thoughts?

Subject: draft welcome letter

I tried to make this as innocuous as I could, it will not make the New York 
folks happy but I don't think we should go beyond this right now.  I have to 
print these Wed AM so please give me some feedback ASAP!
