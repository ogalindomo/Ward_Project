"Brian, Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you."
I think he has a good idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.
"Currently, it is done on an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation."
"Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?"
It would be an excellent start.
Thanks.
