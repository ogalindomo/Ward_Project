Again, not sure about these new procedures! 

The signing authority at the back of Mark's agreement says David Oxley. We 
have always had a member of Office of the Chair in London sign these, ie 
Frevert, Sherriff and I was hoping Mark Frevert's signature would do in this 
case as well.

Please confirm, thanks
Tara
