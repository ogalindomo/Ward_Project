"Michelle,Thanks for forwarding the COBRA e-mails to me."
"After reading them, I amconfused as to where we stand."
The people listed below are on Ecogas COBRAand I suspect that they have not been presented with the option of switchingto Enron COBRA.
"At the very least, I do not think it has been presented tothem in the light that Ecogas COBRA will soon be nonexistent."
Could someonein your shop  send (or resend) COBRA packets to the people listed below?
"Iwill send a letter to the same list to let them know that they need toswitch or lose coverage after January 1, 2001."
"This may be duplicatingearlier efforts, but I want to make sure that no one falls through thecracks after we dissolve Ecogas."
