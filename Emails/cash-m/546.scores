"Dee,Ozzie Pagan called me earlier today and informed me that Cogentrix's Tom McCarrin (sp?)"
had started to compile basic employee/employment information relative to the two North Carolina power plants that ENA is planning to acquire from Alamac Knit Fabrics.
I then spoke to Michelle Cash and she agreed with me that it would be best if you would call Mr. McCarrin in order to give him guidance as to the specific employee and benefits information that you are going to want to see.
I am told that he has not been given the Due Diligence Worksheet.
Mr. McCarrin's phone number is 704-525-4897.
Thank you in advance for your help in moving this aspect of the Alamac transaction forward.

"As you will note, it is quite extensive, and I rather doubt we'll receive helpful information by simply sending this document to Alamac."
"Once you have had a chance to review the type of information that HR needs to have in order to conduct due diligence, please call me so that I can coordinate this effort with Michelle Cash and Dolores Lenfest from HR."
