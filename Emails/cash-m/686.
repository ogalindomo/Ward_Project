I spoke with Bonnie yesterday, and she told me that she also had a call to 
return from you.   Just in case y'all didn't have the opportunity to discuss 
it, I did get names from her of those with whom she had previously worked.

She was hired at Enron by Jim Hughes, and is currently working with Bruce 
Lundstrom.  She has also worked with Anthony Duenner, who is now commercial, 
but who was at B&P and worked on the PGE acquisition.

At Reboul, MacMurray she worked with John MacMurray and Isabelle Barzun, but 
all of the attorneys with whom she worked at Milbank have since left the firm.

Hope this is what you needed...

Molly
