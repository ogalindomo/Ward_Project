Tim, I just got your letter about  the January trial setting.  When did we 
learn of that setting?  How do we accomplish the goal of keeping our business 
people free from depositions at year-end?  Can that be done?  Michelle

Michelle, I just spoke to Brian Glasser; he informed me that Clonch wants
1.2 mil, therefore, no settlement.  However,  Clonch and Cline have agreed
to meet again this coming Monday to discuss settlement.  Apparently, Clonch
is going to go back and look at his numbers.
