"The GIS version just adds a view words from the employment application alerting employees not to 'overstate' their education, skills, experience, etc."

I will have Mark Holsworth and Kriste Sullivan provide their comments.
Thanks.

I am attaching the security warning messages from both systems for your review.
Andrea and I believe it would be best to combine these statements and would appreciate your assistance in doing so.
"Michelle, as you will recall, you helped us with the statement for HR-GIS."
"I do not know who provided the SAP version, but it seems more similar to the general one on the Corporate LAN."
Please let me know if one of you can assist us with this.
We are under a pretty tight time crunch with July 1 looming fairly closely.
Thank you for your consideration and help!
