I am sorry to have left the details for so late, but here they are.  Pregos
at 7:30.  Unfortunately, Elizabeth cannot make it, Lisa will be flying in
from NYC so who knows when or if she will be there, and Deb has another
engagement, but will meet us for drinks before dinner, so be prompt.  The
rest of us will have a fabulous time eating and DRINKING and trying not to
cause a scene.  See ya'll tonight.
