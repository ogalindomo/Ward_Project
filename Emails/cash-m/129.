The HR Bluffer's guide is back again!!!!

The HR Bluffer's Guide to the Business is a great opportunity for HR 
professionals to learn about our business and HR operations without getting 
bogged down in the details.  These classes are a "quick and dirty" way of 
getting enough information about certain topics to make a real difference, 
real fast.

On Tuesday, March 6th at 11:30 - 1:30, Michelle Cash will present on the 
topic of Mergers and Acquisitions.  
This class promises to offer valuable information that could help today.

The class is free and guess what....We'll provide lunch too!!

You have no reason to miss this great learning opportunity. 

 Please RSVP ASAP...OK?
