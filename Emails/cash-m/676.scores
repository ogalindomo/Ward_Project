"Peter & Michelle,?"
Brian Hiebert forwarded to me Peter's questions regarding the risk of  asbestos litigation at Celgar.
?
"Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British  Columbia are required to contribute to an accident fund which provides  compensation for injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment."
"In  turn,?the Act?provides employers statutory immunity from?damages  in respect of any personal injury, disablement or death arising out of and in  the course of employment."
?
The accident fund would cover asbestos claims.
There are no  exceptions?which would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.
"The Act does?not prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg."
"manufacturers of asbestos, but employers, as stated, are immune from such  actions."
?
Compensation is payable if the worker sustains pulmonary injury by a  disabling form of asbestosis.
We will make the appropriate enquires about any  compensation paid to Celgar employees.
