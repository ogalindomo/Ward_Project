We have recently had an enquiry from the UK Inland Revenue regarding Dennis Pick's termination payment.
"They have asked that we supply them with a copy of Dennis's original contract of employment (we have the letter of assignment on file, but this is not sufficient for their enquiry)."
Do you know a contact who we could request the contract from?
Thanks for your help.
Victoria
