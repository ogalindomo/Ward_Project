"I suggest an email mailout, with the policy residing on the hr web site."
"It would be a good idea to place a link to the policy on all pages that involve HR data, such as PEP, comp data base, SAP HR, etc."
"Brian, what do you think?"
"MichelleAndrea Yowman@ENRON09/17/2000 04:21 PMTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Brian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Revised Data Protection Policy  Do you need any type of certification that the employee has read and accepts like the ""Certificate of Compliance""?"
Can we put it on the front page of ehronline and HROL?
Should this just be an email mailout?
Should this reside on the hrwebsite?

It seems as if it should come from your group and go out globally.
What do you think?
