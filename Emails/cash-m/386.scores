"For those of you I have not spoken with, our counterparty has accelerated the schedule, and as a result we only have a couple of weeks to assemble a team for the data room."
"The data room process will begin on Sunday evening, August 13 in Quebec City, Quebec, and end Friday, August 18 in Port Angeles, Washington, with a travel day in between mills on Wednesday."
"My assistant, Susie Fallon will handle all the travel arrangements."
We will receive an updated itenerary and index of the data room the middle of next week.
I will distribute the information memorandum at Monday's meeting.
"I apologize for the short notice, but look forward to working with you all on this transaction."
"Thanks,Patrick"
