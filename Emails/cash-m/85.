What happens to those people that are currently on Ecogas cobra when Ecogas
is no longer in existence? They have not utilized the 18 months that they
would be entitled to receive those benefits. Is Enron going to pick them up
like they did for the 10/13/00 layoff? Do we need to direct this question to
someone at Enron?
