Robin - Can you send me the detail on this.  I want to know exactly how the 
exotics are coming in.  (I will look at it tomorrow).  These positions look 
fine I just want to get more precise.

Kathy,

Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it 
looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't 
send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel 
file that Brian saved in the directory.

Thanks,
Robin
