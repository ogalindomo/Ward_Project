Hi Robin,

Here is the IM Positions TXT for the 17th. The deal ID column looks to be 
different than the one's I was sending before last week. Should these be 
numbered 1,2,3... as before? Please advise. I'll be calling soon to let you 
know we are official, so if there is anything wrong with the file you can let 
me know.
Talk to you soon,
 Brian
