Robin,
I just want to make sure that all of our txt files that I send you are being 
reported in the benchmarks
1)  Exotics:  I noticed that Canada's exotics positions were not included in 
the benchmark on Friday?  Where are they being reported?  
2)  Power:  Also are Canada's Power positions being reported now - I have 
been sending them on a daily basis for about a week now.
3)  IM:  Please send me what you report for IM as I want to make sure that it 
agrees to the excel file that I save to the Houston directory daily
