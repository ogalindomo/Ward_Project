Robin,
Please see the reconcilation I have prepared.  Our primary difference seems 
to be with the first quarter.  It may have something to do with origination.  
During Q2 I had Q1 restated so that the p&l was did not include orginated 
income.  The p&l numbers that you have provided seem to include originated 
income.
Kathy

Robin,
There is a significant difference (640K) in July.  Can you further break it 
out by intramonth and term.
Kathy
