Hey brother, the move is setup for Wednesday, November 15.  They are going to 
be packing and moving Chris from 8am-12am, then they will head over to your 
place.  I'll have Chris give you a call (@ 713-853-3512) when they are 
finishing up at his place, so you can head over to your house.

Thanks again,

Bruce
