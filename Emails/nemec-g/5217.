Since I will be out of the office on March 15, I am forwarding the amendment 
to the Exhibit A's. You will only need to access these attachments if we 
elect to reduce the volume on either contract.

Otherwise, I will leave the completed, intialed originals (termination 
letters, revised Ex. A and PA amendment) with Chris Calger when I am in 
Portland on Thursday.





Thanks
