I read the agreement and my only comment sounds like something Chris Hoekenga 
might say (so treat it with the same amount of respect).  Along the same 
rationale for defining Standard Pressure, we could define Standard 
Temperature as 60o F.  If it makes the agreement shorter or easier to read 
then its a thought (I really need to get away from BR for a while...)
