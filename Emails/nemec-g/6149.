The Northern Border guys would like to recognize their $500,000 in earnings 
associated with  the Kern Capacity that they syndicated in the 3rd Quarter 
and make it part of the Master Service Agreement between ENA and Crestone.  
This is the document that they proposed.  We should recognize some additional 
float given the lag in the payment date.  Gerald can you approve this from a 
legal standpoint?

Mark
