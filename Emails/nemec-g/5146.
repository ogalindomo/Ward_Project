According to Carol Carter, Co. 703 (Enron Compression Services) has a bank 
account from Hubbard, and Bisti and Bloomfield.  I was looking through the 
Hubbard deal book, dated March 31, 1995 to find out about these bank 
accounts, but unfortunately, couldn't find any information.

We need your assitance in finding out if Co. 703 can take this bank account 
to make loans to Enron Corp.  Please let me know if you can assist us in 
finding this information.  Thanks.
