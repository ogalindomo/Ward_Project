Due to heavy rains and water damage on the B-2 level, Studio B and the 
Cycling Studio have been closed for today.  The following modifications have 
been made for Wednesday's Group Exercise Class Schedule.
Cancelled:
12:00noon and 5:45pm Cycling Classes
12:30pm Fitness 101

Temporarily relocated to Studio A
11:30am Muscle Mania
No Change - classes will be offered as usual in Studio A
12:30pm Pilates
6:00pm Hatha Yoga

Maintenance is working to "clean-up" the problem.  We anticipate being fully 
operational on Thursday; however, if more time is needed to dry out B-2 we 
will keep you posted of any class time and location changes.

We appreciate your understanding.
