I will be taking a new job as of Monday, October 15th at Piper Jaffray.  As
many of you know my current employer, Brenton Investments (Brenton Bank)
was acquired by Wells Fargo & Company and my position will eventually be
eliminated once the conversion to Wells is completed.  Therefore, do not
send e-mail to my Brenton address any longer
 (matt.gillaspie@brentonbank.com) as I am not sure how much of the
remainder of this week I will be around my desk or even at the Ingersoll
office.  Send e-mail to this address (home --->  cattlepig@earthlink.net)
 until I know for sure what my work e-mail will be.  Thanks.
