Per your request, year-to-date 1999 gross operating revenues for Enron 
Midstream Services, LLC was $14, 158.95.  This amount is very small because 
EMS did not begin operations until the end of December 1999.   

Per Wayne Pierce of the Tax Department, EMS's SIC code is the same as ENA's.  
It is 422700.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
