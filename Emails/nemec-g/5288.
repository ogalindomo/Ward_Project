Subject: Confidentiality Agreement


Jean,
I enjoyed talking to you today and look forward to working with you and
others in your group.  We're pleased that Enron is interested in pursuing
discussions with regard to a potential acquisition of Entergy's majority
interest in Highland Energy.

Attached is a draft confidentiality agreement.  If the agreement is
acceptable, please fill in the information for Enron, sign it and return to
me.  Otherwise, call me or John Denman (281-297-5325) to discuss any
revisions to the agreement.  Once the CA has been executed, we'll forward an
information memorandum on Highland to you.

Thank you for your expression of interest,
John
