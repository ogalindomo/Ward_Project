Mandy talk - that's funny.

Same ol', same ol' for me, too.  My brother and his wife and my nephew
stayed with me for a few days.  We had Christmas Eve dinner at Mom's.
Garret (my nephew) and I had to rush home to beat Santa.  That was fun -
it's the first time in a while Christmas and Santa have been exciting -
guess a 6 year old helps with that.  Saw Mom again Christmas Day and Dad,
too.  Nothing big.

I'm so ready to get the hell outta this job.  I had an interview yesterday.
And I'm still waiting on Pennzoil to get back in town.  I hope I know
something before I go to London so I can just slide into something new when
I get back.

Any big plans for New Year's??
