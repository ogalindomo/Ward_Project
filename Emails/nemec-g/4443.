I forwarded Calpine's comments on our term sheet to you.  Debra is making 
changes to Enfolio

I have talked to Eric Ledaine in Calgary about early assignment features - he 
should get back to me soon. 

I will head up to your office after lunch. We still need to turn this around 
today. (sorry!)

See you soon.
