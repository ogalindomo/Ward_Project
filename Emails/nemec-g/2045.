Done.  
Does it look good other than that (i.e. are your ready for executables?)

Could you please change the reference to the ENA Global contract #33206000, 
this is a Colorado Interstate pipeline contract # not an ENA contract #.  If 
you have any questions please call me at (303) 575-6474.

Thanks 
Paul
