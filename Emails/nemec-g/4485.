Gerald, I think we need to again followup the January nominations with the
appropriate letter to Wildhorse about the nominations to NWPL.  If you
agree, can you please forward a draft to me.
Thx

Ken Krisa

After talking with Liz Orr, I think it's best to make the Jan nom at 2,500
MMBtu/d.  Any additional production would be applied to the Wildhorse
imbalance.
