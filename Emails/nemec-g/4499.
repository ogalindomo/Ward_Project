The final final documents.  I made two corrections:
1. The transaction confirmation in the address section from Calpine
Corporation to Calpine Energy Services, L.P.
2. The Enfolio agreement exhibit D - deleted reference in signature line of
Calpine Energy Services GP.

Attached are the executables.  Please note the a redline of the Capacity
Release and Assignment Agreement is also included.  I cleaned up references
to the Renewal Notification (which are now the Non-Renewal Notification)
that were missed earlier in Article 3 and Article 5.

Please note the Exhibit D of the Enfolio Master also needs to be signed by
Calpine.
