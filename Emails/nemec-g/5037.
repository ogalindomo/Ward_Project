Hey there!

Here's my personal e-mail address...work is barbara.waldrop@cox.com.

Thanks for the so called e-mail yesterday! Ha!  Actually, I will check again
when I get to work this morning.

Anyway, hope you got all your songs downloaded last night and got a good
nights sleep.  No more cramps for me last night.  I was very excited.

Have a great day at work and I will talk with you a little later!  Also, I
will find out what the definite plans are for Saturday night.  Like I said
last night, the whole little birthday party may never come around.  We may
have to be creative on our own!
