Becky Spencer usually does your time, but she is out on vacation.  Would you 
please send me all the time that you usually send to her, so Carolyn and I 
can get it entered.  It has to be in by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.   Becky thought 
she could do the time when she returned on January 2nd, but we were just told 
it had to be in tomorrow.  Thanks, Suzanne
