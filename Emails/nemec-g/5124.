Audrey,
Here  is the application form for the pipeline interconnect for Williams.? I  
would like to submit next week - that will get the ball rolling.? In my  
discussion with Williams, it could take up to 8 months from application to  
completion of construction - that is based on their current workload.?  Steve 
indicated he would hope it would take less.? Also need the  application to 
determine if they can really use the South Canyon tap or  not.? I indicated 
that we would like that if at all possible, but in any  case, we can share 
the instrumentation and communications equipment.?  Discussed lots of options 
and the need for start-up fuel gas and other uses from  time to time.? 
?
Please  look over this form and let's discuss.? 
?
Ken
