After I forwarded our confidentiality agreement to Buccaneer, Buccaneer (a 
partnership between Williams and Duke) has suggested that we use their 
agreement because it has been approved by both partners.  Can you take a look 
at their agreement?

Subject: Buccaneer Confidentiality Agreement




Hi John, 
In reviewing your confidentiality agreement with our lawyers, they suggested 
that we use the Buccaneer Confidentiality 
Agreement that the partnership (Williams/Duke) had approved.? I have attached 
ours below.? Just hung up the phone w/you.? Let me know if this works for you.

Thanks 
Jan
