Also, need to put assignment language in the PA. Kern allows for the 
assignment of TSA's. Go figure!

Subject: Question About PA

Thought of another question re: the PA for the expansion. Why does the 
agreement overide the GT&C tariff provisions for payment (last paragraph in 
Article II)? 

Also, can you extend the "management out" to Feb 21? My thoughts are that a 
few more days are needed on our part. Will you have already programmed the 
different scenarios such that it is not a rigorous processs to recalculate 
the rates?

After we sort out the answers to these questions, we'll send a red-lined 
version of the PA to you for review.

Regards,

Stephanie
