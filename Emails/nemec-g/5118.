Billy,

As requested I have attached the form agreement for firm intrastate 
transportation service. 
This form agreement should not be sent to outside parties without the legal 
department's prior approval.
If you have any questions give me or Gerald Nemec  (x3-3512) a call.  

Thanks,



Eric Gillaspie
