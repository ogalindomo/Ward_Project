Attached please find the revised Amendments (both clean copy and marked copy 
showing changes to 5/23 draft to reflect updated numbers provided today by 
John Scarborough).  As noted in my earlier e-mail today, I need:    

(1) Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, Section 1.01, definition of Offer 
Price (need revised Class C member interest offer price), 

(2) Exhibit A to Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (amount of ECS' capital 
contribution in respect of Gallup, presumably value of contributed assets),

(2) Flow of Funds Memo (need new number for Section 3(a)(ii) (amount ECHO 
wires to ECS), and

(3) Flow of Funds memo (need new number for Section 3(b) (amount ECS wires to 
ECHO).  

The Amended and Restated LLC Agreement and Flow of Funds memo are included in 
the closing volume previously delivered to you.

Thanks, NJD
