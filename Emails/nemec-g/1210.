I want to have the HSR filing and affidavit re-executed by Jim Derrick before 
we file.  The signature that is on the filing currently is over a week old.  
I think that is too stale.  If you think that we will be filing by next 
Monday, I will send signature pages to Jim Derrick tomorrow, otherwise I will 
wait for a day or two.
