No, we have not received any information from Gulf Power.  Gulf's technical 
group has proposed two or three different 
configurations that do not agree with our Substation Design and Description 
package that was submitted back in Nov.
or Dec. of 2000.   My understanding of the issue/s really revolves around the 
"reliability" and the turn around time if a 
breaker or something like that breaks.  Our design offers a much quicker turn 
around in the event of a failure (or lightning
strike).   

The approach that Gulf's technical group is taking is causing our technical 
support from ET&S to be consuming much more
resources and will end up costing ECS relative to the Project Management 
agreement with ET&S.  I'm concerned about this
because my understanding was that ET&S was providing some oversight and 
updates to ECS regarding the substation.
It now seems more like a technical debate / negotiation that I felt was 
already defined.  

Chris, I believe we may need to approach our counterparts at Gulf should this 
issue not be totally resolved by the end of this
week.

Have you guys received any information from Gulf Power concerning regular 
updates on the construction?  Jeff indicated that Gulf would be willing to 
provide updates monthly.  If we haven't heard from Gulf, we need to push them 
to provide this info.
