Gerald - I don't know exactly what I am doing these days and after lunch 
today,
I feel even more clueless.  I need you to know that I never wanted or thought 
in
a million years that this would be happening to us.  I also need you to know
that I have never felt so low, this is not easy for me AT ALL.  I can't bring
myself to sign the divorce papers.  This all seems so unreal to me.  I am 
sorry
I doubted your capacity to forgive me early on, but I just couldn't imagine 
that
you would ever be able to live with me again after knowing what I did.  I 
wish I
had done things differently and handled myself better.

It was good to see you and have a normal conversation like we used to.  I hope
you have a fun weekend.  See you Wednesday.

Lisa
