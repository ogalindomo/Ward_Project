I am trying to purchase El Paso capacity from the referenced counterparty - I 
would take assignment (via release program) of 11,418 MMbtu/day, Permian to 
Socal Border, for the time period June 2001 - October,  2002 (17 months). I 
would re-release the capacity back to him for the remaining one year term for 
November 1, 2001.

The demand charge for this capacity is roughly $.40/mmbtu. I would like to 
get your feedback on credit exposure (in case he goes under before I can 
release it back to him in November). This transport is currently deep in the 
money.

Please advise ASAP.

Regards,

Stephanie
