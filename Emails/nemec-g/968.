As most of you know, I will be out of the office from this Wednesday at 11:30 
a.m. through Friday, July 28,2000.  I am attaching a listing of pending 
projects showing status of completion.  While I believe all is under control, 
I am leaving you the attached in case you need to find any documents in my 
files for further action prior to my return.  Everything that I have pending 
is located in the hanging files by the window, under one of the following 
subject headings:

Storage
Transmission
Offshore
Assets
Third Party Transport

Pat should be able to help find anything you need in my files (computer and 
physical).

Thanks for your help.

Steve
