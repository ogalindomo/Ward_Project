Gerald:  I don't find any executer agreements with or pertaining to either 
entity.  We have a draft agreement with HNG Storage about our possible 
financing of their purchase of Energy South, but I don't have an executed 
agreement - that was in September.

Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any 
Enron entities have with the following companies:

Bay Gas Storage
Energy South

Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
information.  Thanks for your help.
