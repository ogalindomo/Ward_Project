I just spoke with Patrick Locke at Cannon Interests.  He indicated that a Jan 
4, 2002 payment date would be acceptable for the letter agreement amendment.

Let me know if you need any further information.  If not, please e-mail the 
new amendment and I will forward on to Patrick.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison
