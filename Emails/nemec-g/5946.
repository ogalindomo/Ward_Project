Subject: Thursday nite out!!!!




I just got my transfer orders from Division HQ.  128 days and I'm out of this
unit.  End of August--DEROS.  CONUS here we come!  You haven't seen a
short-timers attitude till you've seen mine.  The only time I'll even peek 
over
these sandbags is if Ms. Klum and ALL of Hef's girlfriends are playing jiggly
Twister and I've been hitting the T-stick a little hard.  Otherwise I'll be
bunkered down, researching where I'm going to be when I get back on the block
(any ideas, let me know).  That's right, no more working for the
government......I'll be a civilian again!  Captain Chrome-dome will be in
charge!

To celebrate, we'll do happy hour where they've got a good patio, several
well-aged 18-year olds, and Mother's milk on tap.  So join us, won't you?

WHERE:    The Harp
          1625 Richmond Ave  (between Dunlavy and Mandell)
          Houston, TX
          (713) 528-7827

WHEN:          Thursday, April 26th
          6:30 ish

WHY:      127 and a wake up, baby!

Shortly yours,

T-bone
