I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never 
turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar 
boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  

How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This 
is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.
