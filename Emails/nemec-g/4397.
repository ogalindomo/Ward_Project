Gerald,  

Here's Hanover's letter.  A big concern of mine going into this meeting is 
knowing Brian's and Al Lavenue's frame of mind at this point , we are going 
to leave at an impasse.  Several scenarios shake out of that:   1) legal 
action by Hanover against us   2) Hanover pulls their machines or just shuts 
them down which in either case I would assume we are exposed to legal 
recourse from our customers  3) all the above plus acreage dedicated to us is 
released and we are out of the Powder.  Lets discuss ASAP.  Thanks

Ken
