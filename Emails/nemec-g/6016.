Just got word that Uncle Joe Kureska passed away at 7:00 P.M. He had been
going down the last few weeks. Debbie said he had a real bad infection. He
told Dad the other day that he was really hurting bad. Don't know any of the
funeral arrangements as yet I'm sure it will be sometime this week. Well all
for now talk to you'll later. Love .........Mom
