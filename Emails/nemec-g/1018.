Hi everybody,

I have 4 spots left on this trip. It's a small group - only six divers
right now.   If you are interested, please let me know asap.  Full
payment is required by the end of July. Cost is $540 + dives.  This
includes roundtrip air on Continental betwwen Houston and Cozumel,
double occupancy accomodations at the Casa Mexicana which is the new 5
star hotel, one way transfer from the airport to the hotel and breakfast
everyday.

We'll be diving with Yellow Rose Divers and can do up to 10 dives over
the weekend.  If you want all 10 it's $325.  If not, we can work out
your schedule.

Hope you can make it!  It's Bobby Doyle's 50th birthday.

Kristi
