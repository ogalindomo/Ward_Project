Gosh, I'm not sure I can live up to that advanced billing....I'll try to be
fun, but you must remember the "hot" part is coming from a married guy!
Actually, I was planning on going out with 2 or 3 other girls tomorrow
night, but I'm sure we can move it up a few hours (no, I'm not always such
a pushover!)

Sounds like fun, let me know the details.....look forward to meeting y'all!
