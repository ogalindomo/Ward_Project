Hello Gerald,

I just wanted to drop you a line to apologize for not getting the letter
response out to you.

Do you know if Russell contacted the Canadian office about issuing the
Canadian draft agreements for review and finalization with the U.S.
contracts?  I thought that was his intent, but we have received nothing as
yet.

Have a wonderful Easter holiday!

I will try to address first thing next week.

Talk to you then.

Tx.

Ann
