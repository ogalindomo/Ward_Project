Subject: Precedent Agreement with Board Approval Language - delete previou s 
documents




Stephanie, I apologize for the confusion.? Attached you will find the correct 
revised language for the board out approval.? The only change that has been 
made to the previous version sent this morning is that Shipper needs to 
provide "written" notice by Feb. 15.? The termination fee can follow after 
that date.
