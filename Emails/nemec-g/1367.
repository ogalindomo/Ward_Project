Attached is a memo from Chris Martinez, Environmental Engineer for Western, 
which details the chronology and current status of the methanol spill which 
occurred during the hydrotesting of the Ft. Union pipeline.  As mentioned in 
the memo, the spill was reported to the Solids and Hazardous Waste Division 
of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality and they are  in agreement 
with the proposed plan for remediating any remaining contamination.  Also 
note that our estimated cost to complete the remediation is $25,000.

If you should have any questions or concerns please contact myself at 
303.450.8402 or Chris Martinez at 303.452.8418.

Thank You
