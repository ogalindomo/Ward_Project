to answer the rest of the questions.  In the section where it says
"current", the card should be signed by Robert Morgan.  The operator is
Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC. Where it says "former" it should be signed
by Redmond on behalf of LRCI, Inc.

Rusty, where do we stand on revisions to the permit app?  I understand that
the MIT went well.  Please call me to discuss plans to proceed with the
application.

Rusty,
The Pink card, Form MD-10-R-A, requires an effective date of change.  What
do you suggest as the date?
I assume the new Operator is "Bridgeline Storage Company, L.L.C.  Is this
still correct?
The signature blank normally will have the person's name typed above it and
then the phone #.  Should I use Brian L. Redmond, President of LRCI, Inc.
with a phone # (713) 853-1839 or Robert Morgan?
I'll send a copy of the pink card via fax.
Harry
