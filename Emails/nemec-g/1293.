Hi divers,I'm forwarding an email to you about the new dive club in Houston 
called the HammerHeads.? Enrollment is always open, so if you'd like to meet 
future dive buddies or just trade stories, all you have to do is show up. 

I'll keep you posted on other diving events as they occur.

I'm sorry I'll miss you all this month.? I'll be in California starting the
