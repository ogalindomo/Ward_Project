Gerald,

I finally got a chance to review the GTC and am sending you my suggested 
wording changes and questions in the attached.  Most of the changes I'm 
suggesting are driven by the changes that I think should be made to the 
Breach of Obligations and Remedies Section.  Let's find some time Monday 
morning to discuss.

I looked at the Product Description but did not make any changes because I 
think I need a better understanding of its use and legal effect.  The main 
thing I'm concerned about is its looking like a contract for the brokering of 
capacity, as opposed to the description of a means for executing a capacity 
release transaction with a Pipeline.  Let's discuss.

Steve
