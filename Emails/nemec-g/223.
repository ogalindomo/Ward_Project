Melissa,   I would prefer to have Brian Bierbach sign.  His title is Vice 
President.  Let me know if you need anything else.  
Thanks.

Gerald - I am preparing the affidavit, and we would prefer if it is signed
by a business person, rather than a lawyer.  What was the name of the
business person in Denver who was on the conference call when we
were arranging this deal?  Would it be okay if he signed? Sorry I can't
remember his name.

Melissa
