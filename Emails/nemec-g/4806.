completed your review, please forward your comments to me so that I might 
incorporate credit's opinion before we get back w/ them.

Brant -

Here you go.  Let me know if we need to change anything in here.  If not, I 
will have Randy sign if and we can get this off to Bill.

Thanks

Trevor

Any thoughts on the Triad LC?
