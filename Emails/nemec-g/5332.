Barry Tycholiz has told me Kern will deliver its proposed Assignment and 
Release agreement to CPN and us tomorrow morning.  It will be necessary for 
ENA, CPN and Keern talk tomorrow to discuss the agreement.  I'll pass the it 
along as soon as it is received.  

Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.
