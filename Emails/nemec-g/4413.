Attached is a revised book and model per our discussion in the meeting this 
morning.  Gerald researched the gathering contracts and found that they are 
mostly in $/mmbtu instead of $/mcf.  This knocks down the value of gathering 
all the entrada reserves down by about $2mm and thus total value is now at 
~$8mm.  The value of the Dakota gas is not impacted much.
