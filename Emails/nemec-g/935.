Hi everybody,

I wanted to let you know that I'm starting to get lots of inquiries
about the Cayman Madness trip since the deadline is quickly
approaching.  If you are interested, please don't wait until the last
minute.  Full payment for the trip is due no later than Friday, July
28.  After that, I have to release all extras spots.

There are 8 spots left on the Cayman trip.  The trip is from Thurs -
Thurs, Sept 29 to Oct 5.  Cost from Houston is $1268 which includes
airfare, double occupancy hotel accomodations, 2 boat dives daily,
unlimited shore diving, five big parties and tons of other diving
stuff.  If you can make it, please let me know asap.  I'll send you the
full details.

We'll be at the lakes on July 29 and 30.  You're welcome to join us.

Hope to see you soon,
Kristi Foster
