		 Subject: Revised Docs

Attached please find revisions per our conference call. Excluding all but 
one, we made Enfolio changes proposed by Michael. Our only deviation was to 
delete article 4.2,  sec vii, re: MAC.

Based on your QUICK feedback, we will send execution documents electronically 
so Janet can initial.

Please call me at Gerald's office if you have any questions.

Regards,

Stephanie
