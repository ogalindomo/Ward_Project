Attached please find a Service Schedule to the Crestone/ENA Master Services 
Agreement.  This is intended to cover the ENA purchase of Citation's gas at 
the receipt points under the Bear Paw Gathering Agreement with Citation with 
redelivery at the terminus of Fort Union.  I am not sure this is the best 
structure for effectuating this transaction and would like your thoughts.  
Another thought would be to have Citation Partially assign its gathering 
agreement to ENA and have ENA pay Bear Paw for the Bear Paw piece and use 
this schedule only for the Fort Union Gathering Service.  


Question:  How did ENA handle the Bear Paw gathering fee in its agreement 
with Citation? Did they take a partial assignment of the Citation/Bear Paw 
gathering agreement?
