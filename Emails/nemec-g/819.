Hello HammerHeads & Friends,

   This month's social/meeting is one NOT to miss. I say this for a couple
of reasons. A group of us got together to try to work out some details for
improving and helping the club run smother, but not losing the FUN of the
club. There were 10 of us who looked through the "surveys" and
"brainstormed" to come up with ideas and hopefully solutions. One of the
issues was the meeting "Day & Time". We that every schedule conflict can not
be resolved, but we hope this fixes most of them.  So the social/meetings
will be on the LAST THURSDAY of each month, 7:30-9:30 pm, ANNOUNCEMENTS will
be started at 8pm. This should allow for late comers and not conflict with
members' weekend trips. We also liked Surfers Paradise so will stay there
for now, because of the atmosphere and accessibility.
MARK your calendars , June's social/meeting will be:

29 June, 2000
7:30-9:30 pm
Surfers Paradise
7620 Katy Freeway, Houston , TX
(713) 681-5100
On Katy Fwy. At the Silber Dr. / Antoine Dr. exit, in the Mall with Edwards
Cinemas (IMAX)
(SEE ATTACHMENT)

We will go over ALL the information that was covered, and hand out some of
it printed up. Also, we will be having a couple of FREE DRAWINGS for a few
small things DEMA/HammerHeads has sent to us. So if you want to hang out
with us, WIN some free stuff, and find out where the club is trying to head,
come join us on the 29th  of June.
