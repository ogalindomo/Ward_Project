Gentlemen,

Pursuant to my phone messages, I have attached for your review the draft 
cavern monitoring services agreement.  
David, please advise as to our exposure and any suggestions/additions you 
might have that would be helpful to our position if Texaco damages our 
storage cavern in the performance of the services.

Gerald, could you please verify the entities & other missing information 
highlighted in the document.  I did a corporate information search on Lexis 
and was unable to find the entities as identified on the agreement.



Thanks,

Eric Gillaspie
