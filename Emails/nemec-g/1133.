Chris - As we discussed in today's meeting, can you please forward to me and 
Matt a copy of the ENA "pro forma" firm sales agreement that we would use for 
the type of sale discussed below.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Many thanks,

Stephanie

Stephanie, I just want to follow up on the fuel supply discussion we had for 
FAPSA (the paper plant in Mexicali).

I would like to recover the cost of the gas pipeline, which I'm including in 
the capital costs of the plant, through a fuel supply agreement that we can 
mark to market.

The ideal terms would be for 20 years, an Index price plus SoCal transport 
price, plus $0.22 / MMBtu to Enron project company for an amount of 
approximately 3000MMBtu / day.

I look forward to receiving a draft copy of a standard fuel supply agreement 
so I can familiarize myself with standard market LD terminology.

Thanks,
Matt
