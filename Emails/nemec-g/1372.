Attached below please find the most current versions of the listed documents 
for 20/20.  Please review and provide any comments as soon as possible.  The 
blackline is from the last version sent Norther Border not the version 
circulated internally yesterday.  

I am particularly concerned with the purchase price adjustment mechanism in 
Article 2 and would like assurance that that provision as written accurately 
reflects the valuation of the transaction.  

Thanks.
