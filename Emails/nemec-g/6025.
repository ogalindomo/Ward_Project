the effective date should be sometime after we file the conversion permit
application.  I would just estimate the date we will file, and make it
effective a week later.

Rusty,
The Pink card, Form MD-10-R-A, requires an effective date of change.  What
do you suggest as the date?
I assume the new Operator is "Bridgeline Storage Company, L.L.C.  Is this
still correct?
The signature blank normally will have the person's name typed above it and
then the phone #.  Should I use Brian L. Redmond, President of LRCI, Inc.
with a phone # (713) 853-1839 or Robert Morgan?
I'll send a copy of the pink card via fax.
Harry
