		 Subject: Alamac Steam Agreement

In considering the worst case scenario...

The Force Majeure provision seems reasonably broad in the Steam Purchase 
Agreement.  Would we be able to rely on this at some point to suspend our 
steam supply to AKF in the event, for unforseen reasons, we could not obtain 
an Interconnection Agreement or transmission capacity to transport power from 
Elizabethtown and Lumberton?
Also, if it were determined that we could not sell power from the sites, can 
we terminate or downsize the scope of the O&M Agreement?

Regards,
