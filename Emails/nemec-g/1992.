I need to get an idea of how many people will be participating in the party, 
so I can make the food order.  If you will be attending, please reply for a 
complete headcount, before lunch.  I plan on ordering (1)Veggie, (1)Greek 
(veggies & cheese, no tomato sauce), (1)Supreme, and (1)Mushroom/Canadian 
Bacon.  If you should have any questions or comments, please feel free to 
contact me.  Thanks, Keegan (5-3317)
