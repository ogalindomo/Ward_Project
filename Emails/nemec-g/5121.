Eric,

I appreciate the brevity of the revised rate sheet.  I marked it up to
reflect our desired changes.  I also requested our Attorney, Gerald Nemec,
prepare the Professional Services Agreement so we can begin utilizing your
resources.  Please note a "Tasking Letter" describing the scope of work and
estimating the cost will be required prior to PCS performing the work.

Thanks,

Nick, 713-345-8273
