Gerald-

Attached is NWPL's proposed facilities agreement.  We're still working on 
final scope/costs, but I thought you might want to take a look at the 
idemnification, governing law,etc.,etc.......

Also, I have a hard copy of the agreement Ken is working with Grand Valley 
Power.  Again, final costs have not been determined.  I'll deliver a copy to 
your office.
