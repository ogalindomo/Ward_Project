Dear Body Shop Member:
Prior to re-opening the Body Shop and while finish-outs are being completed, 
members will be treated to a "Sneak Preview Tour" of the newly remodelled and 
expanded Body Shop between the hours of 9am - 10am and 3pm - 4pm on Tuesday, 
January 16th and Thursday, January 19th.   We invite you to simply stop by 
during these scheduled preview tours and be "wowed" by the expanded and 
improved two level, 25,000 square foot facility.   No appointments are 
required.   We are extending this preview to only Body Shop Members at this 
time.   Looking forward to seeing you then.

In Health,
Lee Wright
Program Manager
