TexasAdmin.com offers this service on a subscription basis.? You may 
subscribe to either agency, or both.? This service is valuable for two 
reasons: 
? 1.??? It saves you time and money.? You do not have to attend the meeting; 
you may watch when it is convenient for you, from any location. 

2.??? It creates a visual record of important administrative decisions and it 
provides a valuable critique of the reasoning processes behind the decisions.
