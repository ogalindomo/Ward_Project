Gentlemen,

Please see the attached production report - note the comment under
"DOWNTIME" at the end of the report.  It indicates Wildhorse pulled out a
compressor last week at the San Arroyo Plant and our pressures have
increased.   We are trying to get more information and will pass it along
when we get it.

Ken Krisa

Attached is the production report.
We are still having high line pressures.
I will call you after I speak with Wildhorse this morning.
