Subject: Revised Cost Estimate w/o Income Tax Gross-up Charge for Temporary 
Meter & Regulator Station for Midcon Carbon Black

Gerald,

As agreed, I think that we need to send Midcon first two pages of cost 
estimate to cut down on questions.  Attached is the file.  Call with 
questions.



Thanks,

Rodney
