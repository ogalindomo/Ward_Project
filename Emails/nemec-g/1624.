I'm booked.  I have an e-ticket.

To pay seperately they have broken your locator number in two . . .
Gerald = MEW487
Eric/Jen = MJWMXZ

I had my reservationist get our seats together already.  I think they
are next to each other, but she didn't speak very clear English, so I
can't guarantee that.




NOW . . . . . . if I can be of further service with hotel reservations
you just let me know.  What are the plans for that?  Jen??  Try to find
some locals to sleep with or what?  Let me know.

Looking forward to it!
