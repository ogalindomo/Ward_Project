gerald,

here is my first pass at the changes with specific wording to be given back
to Universal.  I didn't do any words on Section 15 - thought you might look
at one more time and suggest the words.  Also, I did change the 13.f (4)
provision some - didn't like theirs at all.

Let's discuss as soon as possible.

Ken
