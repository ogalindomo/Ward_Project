I am so glad that I could help you have a good time last night.? I may have 
not been there in person, but I was certainly there in thought..."How can I 
screw over Barbara?"

Eggcellent!!!? Yes, I did have your watch.? However, due to lean times on 
the Nemec ranch, I was forced to see what the cash equivalent of your watch 
would be.? Does $10 sound fair.? Anyway I took the ten bucks, which 
thankfully acounted for both my beers last night.?? Chalk up another one to 
the Nemec leisure activity fund.

By the way, have you seen my watch laying around your house?? I am thinking 
that I left it over there Sunday night. 

Thanks

Okay, we have decided to have an EASTER EGG decorating contest! 
You decorate your own egg - don't go buy a decorated one! 
Judging will be at the BBQ & prizes will be won ... 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 
honors! 

So, be creative!
