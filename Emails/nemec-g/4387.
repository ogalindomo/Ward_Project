Dear U2 Fan,

As promised there are new developments coming onto the site regularly at
present.

Just up we have an exclusive U2.COM animated screensaver, featuring clips
from tracks off All That You Can't Leave Behind.

We've also just posted The Oracle, which promises answers to everything you
ever needed to know about U2. Sort of! Just key in your question and you'll
be surprised at the answer you get. It's Surreal Thing!

We're still running our competition to win a signed set of every U2 album on
vinyl and there's also a few days left to vote for your favourite track from
BOY - before we open the voting on the favourite track on another U2 album.

In January we'll be posting the first information on the new U2 tour - and
we'll e-mail you immediately the information is public.

Best wishes
