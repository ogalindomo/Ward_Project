Gerald,

Since my last email, we have found a file that has a field "pressure study"
for the 3 years prior to the execution of the Mesa Gathering Agreement.  It
does not have anything in the file that relates it to the negotiations with
Mesa, but I am pretty confident this would be the information that the
previous operators would have used to make some decisions.  We are still
unclear whether the data presented is wellhead "flowing tubing pressures" or
actual " gathering system pipeline pressures".  Some of the data seems to
match the FTPs.  We may have some data that could be used to compare against
tubing pressures during the same time frame.

I am currently making a copy of the file and will see if we can also find a
representative sampling of wellhead tubing pressures recorded during the
same timeframe.   Once you get this information, please call and we can
discuss further.
