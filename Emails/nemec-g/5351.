Gerald,

We are currently working on the audit of ECS Compression Services, LLC for the
year ended December 31,2000 and were given your name as the contact for 
internal
legal counsel.  Please find attached the legal circularization letter for you 
to
complete.  As we are to sign off by March 31st, please provide the completed
letter as soon as possible.  We apologize for the delay, as we were given your
name yesterday. If you have any questions, please call me at X6-6269.

Thank you for your help.
