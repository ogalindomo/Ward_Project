Mark,

When I was talking to Liz, she also mentioned that the sale to Retex is not 
official yet.  They were supposed to sign the agreements last week and for 
whatever reason they didn't.  She says they haven't been told yet when it 
will be signed or when the effective date will be.  She said she's pretty 
sure it will still go through.

Let me know if I need to probe for more information.

Theresa
