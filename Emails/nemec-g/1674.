As the father of two juvenile diabetics and a Walk Co-Team Captain (with=20
Shonnie Daniel) here at Enron, I am writing to request you to participate i=
n=20
Enron's drive to help raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's=20
("JDF") annual Walk to Cure Diabetes.  The Walk takes place at 9:00 a.m.,=
=20
Sunday, November 5, 2000, at Sam Houston Race Park.  The Walk itself is=20
extremely enjoyable and it is a festive occasion with hospitality tents,=20
food, music and lots of kids.=20
  =20
  You can participate by walking (and obtaining sponsors) or by sponsoring =
a=20
walker (such as myself or my children).  Last year, the ENA legal team=20
contributed over $5,000 to the Walk (and there is a dollar-for-dollar Enron=
=20
match), which put us in the top 5 teams at Enron.

If you intend to contribute   and walk, let me or Shonnie know and we will=
=20
get you the necessary forms. If you don=01,t intend to walk, your sponsorin=
g=20
contributions should be made by check payable to =01&JDF=018 and you can gi=
ve that=20
check to me or Shonnie.  If you want to participate in either way and want =
me=20
to call you with more information, there is a sign up sheet on my office=20
window across from the Ladies Room on 38.   =20

Juvenile diabetes is an auto-immune disease where the child's immune system=
=20
attacks and destroys his or her pancreatic cells that produce insulin.  As =
a=20
consequence, my children need daily doses of insulin to live, and they must=
=20
closely regulate their diet, exercise and blood sugar. This treatment=20
involves at least 2 insulin injections and 5 blood tests a day, and they wi=
ll=20
never "outgrow" this disease.

Heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, loss of limbs and nerve=
=20
damage are just some of the complications that are associated with diabetes=
. =20
As you can imagine, with such possibilities, there is also a significant=20
psychological price to pay with this disease.  The prospect of a cure =01)=
=20
funded in part by contributions from friends like you =01) does truly make =
all=20
the difference to the outlook of these young people by giving them hope for=
=20
the future.  Experts believe that with adequate funding of diabetes researc=
h,=20
a cure or at least less intrusive and more effective treatments are possibl=
e=20
within the next five years.

Thank you for your consideration of this worthy cause.
