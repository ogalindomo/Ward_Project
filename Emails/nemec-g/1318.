Hal,  We need to add the assignments of the Assumed Obligations from Seller 
to Purchaser as Closing obligations and attach an assignment and assumption 
agreement as an exhibit.  Also can you please have the exhibits revised to 
reflect the proper entities as we discussed yesterday and forward those.  
Call with any questions. Thanks.  Shonnie
