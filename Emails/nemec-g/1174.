Now available for use within the ENA legal department:

_ International Cellular Phone - may be used in over 70 countries; usage is 
charged at $2.49 per minute (there  is no monthly charge for the phone), 
which will be billed to the specific cost center of the user.

_ Power Adapters - give you the capability to use your laptop computer from 
your hotel room, office, etc. in  numerous countries.

Both of these items will be kept at my desk and may be checked out on a
