If you would like to contribute to the fund for Bob, please have your 
donation to me before 4:30 p.m. today.  We have decided to donate the money 
in memory of his Grandmother to the nursing home she had lived in for the 
past 3 years.  I will also be filling out the form for Enron's Gift Matching 
Program.  A small portion of the money will be for a plaque for Bob that will 
be engraved with language regarding our donation.    Bob does not know about 
this!  I will get the plaque over the weekend and we can present it to Bob 
sometime next week.

Update:

Today there will be a full dinner delivered to the Walker household from the 
ENA Legal Department.  The Walkers know there will be a delivery but do not 
know what it is.

I will still be accepting contributions for a gift from those who work 
closely with Bob that would like to do something on a more personal level.

Bob Walker's Grandmother passed away over the weekend.  The funeral was 
Monday.  We are going to get a gift certificate to Luby's for Bob and his 
wife to enjoy an evening dinner, and depending on funds possibly a plant or 
flowers.   If you would like to contribute, please see me.  A card will be 
circulated shortly.
