Hey there guys,

 Sorry to pester you, but I wanted to get an update on where you stand with 
these two (three?) agreements.  Gerald, I know I dropped off a new copy of 
the CIG/WIC agreement to allow us to install an RTU at the Lost Creek 
interconnect site.  Also, you were sent a copy of the Gregg agreement week 
before last.  Can you give me an idea of when I might be able to expect to 
hear back from you on these two items?

If I am just being spacy, and you already responded on the Gregg document, 
please let me know, as I can't find anything in my e-mail.  Thanks, and I 
appreciate it.

Regards,
Chris Sonneborn
