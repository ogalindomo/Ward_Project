Dear Jessica,

As you requested, this afternoon I faxed to you a certificate signed by the 
Assistant Secretary of Enron North America Corp. indicating that ENA was the 
sole member of Enron Midstream Services, L.L.C.  I hope this document 
satisfied your request.

Please advise if you'd like the original sent to you via intra-company mail, 
or if you need additional information or documentation.  

Best wishes,
Mary
