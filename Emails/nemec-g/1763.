Subject: November Nominations into NWPL

Here's the e-mail from Liz Orr regarding November.  Looks like we still have 
to nominate into Questar.

Let me know if I need to do anything.

Sorry, no good news.  Grand Valley still can not deliver to NWPL in
November, so no additional space has opened up at Foundation Creek.  It
looks like your contract must still go to Questar.  I'll keep you posted of
changes.
