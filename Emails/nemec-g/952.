Gerald/Eric-

This new Chevron contract should be IT, intrastate, max volume 
100,000mm/day.  This is probably an interim contract to bridge between the 
expired contract and a new term contract being negotiated by Jeff Austin.  
Let me know if you need more info.  I am out next week, back 7/24.

Cheryl  set up a new global record under 96043716 to replace the expired 
96016261 contract.  Both contracts are point specific.
Legal will need to prepare the actual contract for execution.  I can provide 
Legal with a list of all the attached points but the request and terms of the 
deal should be directed to Gerald and Eric. 

Let me know if I can be of assistance.
