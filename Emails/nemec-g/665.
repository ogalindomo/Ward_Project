From the donations I received for Bob, we were able to purchase an engraved 
plaque as a momento for Bob of our donation to the Baptist Memorial Center 
(the nursing home Bob's Grandmother lived in for the past 3 years).  Since 
this is a very emotional time, I quietly gave Bob the plaque and card right 
before lunch today.  You may drop by to see it at your discretion.

He was extremely touched!  

I am waiting to mail the donation until later this week because I have a 
feeling there is still one or two people who may want to contribute and have 
been too busy to do so.  Thank you again to everyone for keeping Bob and his 
family in your thoughts and prayers.
