GT,  I won't be able to come in for the game this weekend.  I am taking a 
scuba diving class and I have open water dives on both Saturday and Sunday.  
I am kinda pissed off at myself that I didn't realize this when I signed up 
for the class but now I am committed.  I will still sell the tickets to your 
brother and nephew if they want them though.  I can FEDEX the tickets to you 
by Friday or worst case, just have the ticket office leave passes for the 
seats at will call.  Let me know.

G,

G,

How's it going? Are you ready for some football? The tailgate is going to be
another wild one. Hey, my brother and nephew are coming into town. Do you
want to sell your tickets for a c-note and sit with me again? Also, what day
are you coming in? Let me know.

GT
