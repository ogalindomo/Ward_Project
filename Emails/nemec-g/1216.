Bill and Pat -

Attached is a revised scope of work for the Lost Creek SCADA project.  I 
believe that I captured all of the points we discussed on the phone 
yesterday.  Regarding the RTU installation at CIG/WIC, Lost Creek must have a 
separate building for our RTU and radio.  Please let me know if there are any 
further changes needed to the document.
