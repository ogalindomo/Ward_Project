Join Melissa Becker on eSpeak at ethink.enron.com, Tuesday, June 20 at 10 
a.m. Houston time.  Melissa, vice president of Strategic Initiatives, will 
conduct an "open mike" session on the worldwide SAP implementation.

Are you at a remote location or can't make the event? Go into eSpeak now and 
pre-submit your question(s) for Melissa to answer during the scheduled 
event.  We want to answer everyone's questions, but due to the high volume of 
questions we anticipate on this session, it would be helpful if you can keep 
your questions short and simple.  This will increase the opportunity for your 
question to be answered.
