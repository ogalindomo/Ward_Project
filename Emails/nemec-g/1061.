 Gerald,  I made a slight simplification to the Capacity Allocation
Agreement.  Please send me redlines from the originals for the Admin Services
Agreement and the Capacity Allocation Agreement.  After reviewing with Lee
we'll need to get our Cheif Executive Officer to sign.  I'm thinking we'll
need complete sets of the agreements since they are exhibits to the LLC.
