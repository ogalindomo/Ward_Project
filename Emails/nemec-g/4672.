Subject: Precedent Agreement with Board Approval Language




Good morning Stephanie:? The Precedent Agreement has been revised to include 
language regarding the board approval language that you and Kirk discussed 
(paragraph 1.3).? The only other change has been made to the first sentence 
in paragraph 1.5 (reference to Section 1.3 has been revised to 1.4).??? 
Please let me know if this language is satisfactory to you.
