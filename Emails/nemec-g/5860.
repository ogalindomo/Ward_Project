Brant,  We need to ask PCS Nitrogen if they are a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Potash.  If they are not, then Canadian law may prohibit them from providing 
a guaranty for a less than wholly owned entity.  

I will provide you my comments to the documents shortly after lunch.

 Gerald,

Any update on that PCS guaranty review?  Exposures are pushing past $20MM, a 
highly visible exposure.
