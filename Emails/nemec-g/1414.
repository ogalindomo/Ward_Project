Revised version attached.  The only changes from Friday's version are changes 
to deferred vs current Federal Income Tax (see the Wayne Piece e:mail which I 
will also forward to you).  Tax's best estimates given current information is 
that there should be $503,220 of deferred tax liability on ECT Powder River 
and a negative deferred tax liability of $8,609 on ECT Wind River at June 30, 
2000.  Please call if you have questions.
