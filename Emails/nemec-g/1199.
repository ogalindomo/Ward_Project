I have made the changes suggested by Arnold Eisenstein, Tom Rastin, and Jim 
Gill, as well as my own.  Can you look this over quickly before I send it 
back to CompressorTech?  They would like a response by Thursday the 17th.  I 
know it's short notice, but it took a while to collect the changes from all 
the others and I didn't want to send you something that was still changing.  
Our changes should be highlighted in the attached doc.

Thanks
Mark
