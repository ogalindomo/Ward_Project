Hey there!

Just wanted to see if you got to work okay!  Guess who was up in our studios
this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jenn
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be so
much fun.  Now you're sitting there saying, "crap, why did I bring that
up...I was just kidding around!"
