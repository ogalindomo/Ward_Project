Paul, 

Ive attached your spreadsheet with my comments on where the contract between 
Hanover and Enron disputes the request for changes from your people in 
Gillette with the exeption of one task.  Please review your spreadsheet 
against the referenced points and give me a call when you get a chance.  
Thanks

Ken
