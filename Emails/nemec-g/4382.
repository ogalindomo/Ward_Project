Scratch that Gerald.  A bit of miscommunication.   I need to get a copy of 
the CA just to determine who formally has access to the information.  It 
looks like the initial phase of peak load avoidance for TW will be to have 
Gas Control manually monitor the system and make the call themselves.  Who 
specifically has access to the power load info. and what obligations do we 
have?  I'm a bit nervous about turning the access to this web site loose.  

I have contacted Arnold who is now in the ET&S world (instead of EE&CC).  The 
resources we had in-house during the actual project engineering and 
construction were set up to provide the automated load monitoring as part of 
our price quote.  Since we are just now getting access to the info.  via this 
CA that Courtney was working on I believe we will be releasing some 
additional $'s to the system in place.  Arnold indicated that they won't be 
able to start until after the beginning of 2001.

Gerald, 

I work with Mark Knippa in Compression Services and we need your assitance 
for Gallup Project.  We just got access to a website, which monitors load.  
We need to revise the confidentiality agreement to specifically determine who 
can have access to this website.

I would appreciate it if you give me this information as soon as possible.  
You can either call me at 53269 or sen me the information via email.

Thanks.

Maria Tefel
