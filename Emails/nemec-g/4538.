Gerald-

I believe Ken is looking for a non-binding letter of intent.  He is trying to 
put a deal together for Lone Mountain.  He also mentioned needing a "typical" 
gas purchase contract to give them also.  Do we have a form for a non-binding 
gas purchase agreement?  I'm tied up this morning till after 10:00 AM.  I 
will touch base with you after that.

Thanks,

Audrey
