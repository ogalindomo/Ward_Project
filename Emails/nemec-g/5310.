Gerald,

Attached are rough drafts of the non-binding Murphy Medusa bid.  The bid is 
due by end of day on Tuesday 3/20/01.  I am waiting on some data from a 
pipeline consultant.  In addition, we are still running our models to 
determine the tariffs that we will submit.  As usual, the client has dropped 
some last minute requests on us (email this afternoon).  Hence, the nice bid 
schedule I developed was on track until last Friday....but hey, last life.  I 
will try to forward changes to you ASAP.  I now hope to have a "cleaned up 
draft" by Wed. 

As I mentioned, the contingencies listed in the cover letter are repeated at 
the end of the bid. 





Thank you for you support,

Kenn Loch
