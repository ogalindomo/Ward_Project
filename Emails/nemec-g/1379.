San Arroyo - Dakota production is up to approx. 3.4 mmcfd as of today.  Kent 
Harris w/ Wild Horse in Denver is calling Dan Reineke (our contract operator) 
asking him to increase production as much as possible.  Dan told him the line 
pressure has only been lowered for 24 hours, and if they could keep it low, 
we would continue to attempt to increase rates.
