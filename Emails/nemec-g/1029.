Subject: $2.8M wire to Transwestern


Mark,

Have you received the Letter of Agreement from Gerald regarding the payment 
of the $2.8 to Transwestern?  If not, can you check on that please.  The 
funds will be wired on Monday, July 31.  I can use the invoice from 
Transwestern as support, but as for the monthly amortization, I need the 
'letter" from Gerald for audit purposes.  

Thanks.
