 Hi everybody,
I'm going to miss this month's HammerHead meeting.  I'll be in
Washington DC for the Memorial Day weekend.  For those of you who may
not be able to attend either, I've attached some of the info that Kenny
Vassigh and OJ Strickland will be talking about during the meeting.
Hope you have a good time.  See you at the June meeting.

Meeting Details:   Friday 5/26 from 7:30 to 9:30 (NEW TIME!) at Surfer's
Paradise Restaurant/Bar (NEW LOCATION!).  Their address  is : 7620 Katy
Fwy., I-10 at Silber right off of  610.  New members are always
welcome.  Ask for the HammerHeads group.    BTW - We are going to change
our meeting day for month of June and possibly subsequent months to a
day during the week (WED or THURS perhaps).  This is because we are
having difficulty reserving spaces for groups on Friday nights (the
busiest night for restaurants and bars).  We hope this will increase the
effectiveness of our meetings without dampening the fun.  Please let us
know what you think.

OJ will have details on the National Dive-In Day event scheduled for
June 11th (Sunday).  The group will be  going to Athens Scuba Park.
It's located 75 miles southeast of Dallas (about 3 to 3 1/2 hour drive
from Houston.  This is a world-wide dive event.  Let's try to have the
largest group attendance!!!

Sixteen people have already signed up for the Cayman Islands group trip
Sept 28 - Oct 5.  I have reserved 12 more spots in case others still
want to go.  We're getting really close to the deadline, after which I
have to release all unreserved seats.  OJ will have the sign up sheet.
Contact me if you want more info.  FYI - Your space is not reserved
until I've received a $100 deposit check.

We'd like your input on how to improve the club.  OJ handed out two
surveys at the last meeting.  I've attached copies at the end of this
note.  Please fill them out - it's the only way we know what you'd like
to get out of the club. Otherwise you're stuck with our ideas. You can
either turn them in at the May meeting or you can email them to me.  We
also need to small group of volunteers who may be interested in running
for office (no commitment at this time) or just structuring the club.
We'd like to get together with this small group sometime in mid-June
(maybe the 15th or 16th) and divvy up the responsibilities to each
office.  We'll compile this info and share it with the larger group at
the June meeting.  Then if anybody is interested in running for a
position, we can have nominations/volunteers at the June meeting.
Elections to be held later (maybe in July?)  If you have any questions
or comments. please feel free to contact Kenny, OJ or me.
