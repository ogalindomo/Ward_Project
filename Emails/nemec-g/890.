see attached comments regarding the LLC agreement changes.  Mark, sorry we
didn't get together today - I thought I would at least give you my comments
to keep the ball rolling understanding I haven't had a chance to talk to
Chris (he is on vacation) since reading the changes.  Lets discuss prior to
me leaving for Calgary Wed afternoon.  Thanks, Lee H
