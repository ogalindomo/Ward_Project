Brian,

Attached for your review and comment is the Gas Gathering Agreement between 
HPL and Coastal.  I have highlighted certain provisions where I need more 
information from you or a business decision to include or delete and section 
needs to be made.  If you have any questions or comments, give Gerald a call 
at 713-853-3512 or me at the number listed below.



Thanks,

Eric Gillaspie
