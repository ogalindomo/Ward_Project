Hi Ken,

We made our first of the month nom into Questar for December.  As you know, 
the Mesa Tap compressor into Questar is down [drive shaft is broken], so this 
gas cannot move into Questar for the first.  I have spoken with Paul Lucci 
our physical trader, and he has found a market for the gas on NWPL for the 
2nd thru the 4th.  In talking with Wildhorse, they believe the compressor 
will be back up on the 7th.  Thus, Paul is trying to find a NWPL market on 
the 5th and 6th.  The gas on the 1st will be applied to Wildhorse imbalance.
