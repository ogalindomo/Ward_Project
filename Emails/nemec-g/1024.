The wells which have produced and we plan to restore to production are the:
 
1. San Arroyo Unit wells # 1, 2, 5, 6, and 40.
2. The San Arroyo Unit well # 3 had produced from the Entrada, but we 
probably will not try to re-establish production from it.
3. The Bittercreek # 1 is currently a Dakota producer, but previously tested 
(1998) 7.8 mmcfd from the Entrada, and is a candidate to recomplete to the 
Entrada at some point in the future.
4. The San Arroyo Unit #35 is currently a Dakota producer, but we may 
recomplete in the deeper Entrada Zone in a few months.

Call if any questions.
