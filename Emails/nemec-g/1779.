Mark,
Nicole and I reviewed the IT gathering agreement and only have a couple 
comments.
 Section 1.32 - remove the word "whill"
 Section 5.2 - Statement by Gatherer - I would request to have this statement 
by the 15th.

That would be all.  

Theresa

Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the ENA's IT Agreement on Lost 
Creek.  The revisions incorporate Chris Hoekenga's comments.  Please review 
and let me know if this looks acceptable.  If OK we can forward to BR for 
their final review.
