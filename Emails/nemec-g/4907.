At Gerald's suggestion, I modified my earlier draft of this memo that I'm
suggesting to provide to Gulf Power.  I do not address it directly, but the
intention is to support their effort with the PUC.  
Should I add something to strengthen that position from an ECS point of view?

I believe we want to get this out today if possible so let me know any 
comments.
