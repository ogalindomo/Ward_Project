Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the "non-walkers")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.
