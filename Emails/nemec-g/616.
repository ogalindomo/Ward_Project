Attached please find a simple Whitewing structure.  There are 4 outside 
investors in Osprey that must consent to any purchase of the structure of 
more than $40MM.  Thunderbird, which is a Delaware (i think) L.P., will be 
the entity within the structure that will purchase ENA's equity in the Wind 
and Powder River projects.  Let me know if you need further explanation.

Thanks.
