The Oasis Pipeline Contracts are still being routed for signature.  However, 
I received this e-mail from Stacey Neuweiler to continue business as ENA not 
HPLC.

Thanks You.

Per Tom Martin's request, please continue business as ENA, not HPLC for 
September 1,2000.  Until we know the future of Houston Pipeline, we will 
continue transacting as ENA.  Thank you very much for all of your help with 
this.
