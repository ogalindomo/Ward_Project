 On behalf of the Enron Litigation Unit, I would like to thank you for your 
enthusiastic response to our November 9, 2000 CLE in-house ethics seminar.  
At last count, 55 attorneys have RSVP'd.  

 Some of you have asked whether out-of-state credit is available for this 
seminar.  We will only be obtaining ethics credit of 1.00 hour from the Texas 
Bar.  However, we will be happy to make our registration materials, 
hand-outs, etc. available to those of you who wish to pursue out-of-state 
credit.

 All of us in the Unit look forward to seeing you on November 9.



Britt K. Davis
