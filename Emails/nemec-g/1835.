Hey, the movers look like they are going to be coming between the 15th and 
18th of November.  As soon as I get a firm date, I'll let you know.  I am 
going to try to be down there for the move as well.  I really don't want to 
inconvenience you more than I already have.

Oh, by the way, I am single again.  That's right, Jennie I broke up on 
Sunday.  Oh, the poor women of CO, they will never see me coming . . . 
literally (unfortunately).

Hey Bruce,

I have not received final word from the movers yet.  But they have told me
it will be between the 15th and 18th.  They have committed to delivering
our stuff on the 20th or the 21st.  Hope this helps.

Chris

Chris,

Hey, I just wanted to see if you had arrived at a firm date for when the
movers were going to come to do the pack and move.

Thanks,

Bruce
