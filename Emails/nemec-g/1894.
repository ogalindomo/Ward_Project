One last suggested change is in the product description:  we need to add the 
words "and any surcharges" after the word "fuel" as follows:   ."All variable 
charges including without limitation, fuel and any surcharges, are in 
addition to the Contract Price and shall be borne by the Buyer and paid 
directly to the Reference Pipeline."
