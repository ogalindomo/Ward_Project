Gerald,

If possible, I'd like you to attend this meeting with me next Thursday.  I'll 
let you know where it will take place and I will get copies the Coal 
Handling, Trucking and Ash Removal Agreements as soon as they arrive by FedEx.

Thanks,

Steve

I have confirmed Dec 21st at 1:30 in Houston with Kris Johnson and Virgil 
Hutchinson to start discussing the renegotiation/extension of the coal and 
ash handling agreements for both the Lumberton and Elizabethtown plants.

Kris is going to Fedex to us:
 1) the most current agreements with Cogentrix re the Facilities (apparently 
we don't have the most recent documents).
 2) the current property tax records 
 3) a recent environmental assessment that ReUse had done.
