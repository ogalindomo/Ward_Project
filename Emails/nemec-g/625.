 Attached are copies of the quarterly reports to the DOE for 1999 per our 
previous conversation.  Please note that Emerson has been corrected to 
reflect deliveries on TCPL/GRKL instead of NBPL.     Corrections are being 
forwarded to the DOE.
 Please call if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Juanita
