Unless there have been recent changes of which I am unaware, a "gas day" runs 
from 8:00 a.m. on one day until 8:00 a.m. on the next day.  Based on this 
premise, I need to get a clarification of what you actually mean when you do 
a termination letter stating that a contract will be terminated on the first 
of a particular month.

As the systems currently work, if a termination date is entered as the first 
of any month, the deal is rolled over in Sitara for the ENTIRE month.

If Sitara was changed to better read the dates from Global Contracts, it 
would still roll the deal over & allow gas to flow through the 1st (which 
would actually be until 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd).

When you terminate a contract on the first of any month:

Do you mean that gas should only flow through the end of the previous month 
(which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 1st of the next month)?

or

Do you mean that gas should flow through the end of the 1st day of the month 
(which would end at 8:00 a.m. on the 2nd of the month)?

or

Can it be either, based on the individual situation?  (If so, please explain.)

Please let me know your views on this issue.  I have requested the IT group 
to change all of the "1st of a month" termination dates in Global Contracts 
to the last day of the previous month in order to prevent Sitara from 
assuming that the deal is good for the entire next month.  But, before they 
act on this request, we want to make sure that we are interpreting the 
meaning correctly.

Thanks in advance for your help.
