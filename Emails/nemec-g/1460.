Laura's got 8 free passes to the 7:30 show at the Edwards Theater on Katy
Freeway for tonight's showing of "Meet the Parents" with Ben Stiller and
Bobby DeNiro.  If you guys are interested, get back to me ASAP (as in before
noon) and let me know how many tickets we need (all Gillaspies are invited).
We'll need to be at the show by 7pm since it fills up fast.

Hasta,
Rupero
