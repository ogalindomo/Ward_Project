Ken,

I will be faxing you the December Inside FERC Report.  Amazingly so, Questar 
is at a higher price than NWPL.  Questar is $6.14, NWPL is $6.01.  This price 
is higher than Transco Zn 3, Texas Gas, Columbia Gulf, TETCO, Tenn.....  
incredible.

In joking with Mark Whitt, he made the comment that maybe we should keep 
quiet.
