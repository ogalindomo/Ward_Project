Hi guys!

I had a great time last night--hopefully we can get together again sometime!  
It's nice to get out of the house and away from my studying.  I'm getting the 
pictures put on a CD tomorrow, but will only be sending them out to a select 
few.  And, of course, only the ones I approve of!  I don't want them 
circulating around the office too much--I try to keep my outside life 
separate from work as much as possible, ya know??

So, keep an eye out--you may be getting an e-mail over the weekend.........
