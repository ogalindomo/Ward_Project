No problem about bringing it up...but you can kind of see where my mind goes
when you ask something like that!  I have no problem talking with you about
anything, but never want to have the feeling that you are still working on
correcting something else and in the end I would be the one looking stupid.
Make sense?  I'm glad that you did what you needed to!

Actually, I don't think I have moved my body from my chair this entire day
except to go from one accounting office to another.  Actually, I have been
listening to the Beach CD again and that has kept me calm.  Very soothing
music (well...most of it)...kind of like Enya.  I like to listen to stuff
like that on days like these.   Keeps me calm.  I am actually waiting for my
lunch to get here.  Some people went out and Judi and I are having them bring
us something back.  I am ready for a little break.  Maybe I will head down to
the sales dept. now.  Wish me luck!  Should be quite humorous if she is there!
