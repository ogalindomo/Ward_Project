gerald,

here are the comments i received from iroquois on the ca we sent to them.  i 
am ok on the new york law, because i feel confident that any attorney we 
would use, should the occasion rise, would know new york law.  the only other 
comment is that they would like the material to be confidential for three 
years.  i don't know if this means that the entire ca needs to be a 
three-year agreement, or if we can have the confidentiality of the material 
exceed the limit of the ca.  i would have added it into the text, but was 
unsure where to put it.

Can I get this sometime early this weeek?

let me know.

jamie
