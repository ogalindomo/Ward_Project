Attached is Exhibit 1 to the Support Agreement.  This is the entire list of
Basis Trades in place with Enron.  Please let me know if you have any
questions or comments.  Subject to your sign off on this Exhibit and receipt
of your countersignatures, we are from PGET's perspective complete.
Assuming that we will not receive your countersignatures and sign off until
tomorrow, we are sending you the Support Agreement dated today but providing
that the capacity release will take place tomorrow.  Consequently, we will
need one more forebearance through tomorrow.
