Mr. Nemec,

Before I sign the confidentiality agreement, I would like to make sure that 
in the event of my death, illness, etc., that this agreement would terminate, 
in order that this agreement did not fall into my estate or over to my family 
members.

Please let me know if this application could be incorporated into my 
agreement.

Thank you,

Suzanne M. Badeaux
