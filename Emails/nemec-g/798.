Attached please find the new documents related to the Hubbard transaction.  
You will find the Termination Letter for the November 1997 CSA, the new CSA 
and Exhibit B to the CSA (as a separate document prior to having it being 
folded into the document).  I have sent the redlined copy of the CSA to make 
it easier to follow the changes we have made.

Please call me if you have any questions/comments.

Thanks
