Gerald,
Do you know if this document has been delivered to TW?
My guess is that it has not.  I will review, print, sign and have
Melissa deliver to TW unless I hear differently from you.

Who should this be delivered to at TW?
Steve Harris?

Subject: TW Gallup Rate Increase Letter

Attached is a letter to TW notifying them of the CDEC rate increase and 
requesting their election on the pricing adjustment.  Please review.  We need 
to get this to TW asap.
