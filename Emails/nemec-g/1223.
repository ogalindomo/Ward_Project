Melissa,

Please send Julie flowers to MD Anderson from the Upstream Origination 
group.  I would recommend using In Bloom. In addition, please forward this 
information to all the commercial business heads within Upstream.  It is my 
understanding that she can have visitors as of today.

Regards,

Jean

Julie came out of surgery yesterday in good condition.  I talked to her last 
night and she seemed to be in good spirits.  Her room number at M.D. Andersen 
is 528.  Her phone is 713-792-6488.
