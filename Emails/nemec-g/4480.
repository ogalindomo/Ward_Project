Subject: Enron-Calpine transaction conf call


I'd like to propose we all have a conf call at 1:30pm PPT to have final
review and discussions regarding credit and any contract matters as
appropriate.   We plan to have legal and credit people on the call with us.
Pls plan to have the same so we can all review issues together and draw this
matter to a conclusion.

Stephanie, pls send us updated docs per our discussions this morning.

Conf call in number:
888-387-4875

Participant code:
6002084

Thanks.  Call me if you have any questions.
Joe
