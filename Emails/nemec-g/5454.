Mark,

I have forwarded via overnight carrier four originals of a package
describing and quantifying all issues with Wildhorse (or Tom Brown Field
Services) related to the San Arroyo Gathering Agreement.  Please distribute
one copy to Andrew Edison, one copy to Gerald Nemec, one copy to Scott
Josey.  The other copy is for your review and files.

Please call or email me when you receive the package.

Thx

Ken Krisa
