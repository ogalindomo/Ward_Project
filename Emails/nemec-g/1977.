i was really tired this morning driving in, but i'm okay now.  are you
tired?
i had some really freaky dreams last night.  somethin about you makes me
restless when i'm trying to sleep.  what's up with that?
so you leave friday and come back in ten days?
you're gonna have so much fun.  i'm so jealous.
my ankle hurts.
