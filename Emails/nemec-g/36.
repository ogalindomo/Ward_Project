Subject: Tony Garza visit

 The Pipeline Joint Defense Group/TECALA, of which HPL is a member, has 
invited Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Tony Garza to come to Houston to 
meet with the group.   I have tentatively offered to include as part of the 
meeting a tour of the Enron Gas Control Room (can you do that, James?) for 
Chairman Garza and a small number of people from the Group (maybe about a 
dozen).  We would like a larger number of representatives from companies 
which are members of the Group to attend the general informal discussion with 
Chairman Garza, probably at either the Enron Building, The Met, or otherwise 
nearby.  Tentative dates are June 23 and June 30, probably in the middle of 
the day with lunch.
 Please let me know whether or not you would like to attend the meeting, and 
if so what date(s) work for you, and I will pass the information on to Roxann 
Neumann, who is coordinating the meeting.  If you think any others would like 
to attend, give me a call (36417) or cc:mail.
