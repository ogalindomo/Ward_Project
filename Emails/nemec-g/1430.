Subject: Texaco Gathering Contract

Jackie,

I recently rolled Texaco's gathering contract for .025/mmbtu for the next two 
years beginning at the end of their current contract.  Could you amend the 
contract to reflect this agreement?  Thanks EDG

Texaco contact - Margie Hadler 504.680.1403  

Let me know if I need to do anything.  EDG
