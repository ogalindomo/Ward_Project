My Dad's surgery has been moved to Monday of next week (10-16-00).  I will be 
out Monday and Tuesday.  I will also be out tomorrow (Thursday, Oct. 12) to 
take my Dad to the hospital for his pre-op stuff.  Please re-arrange my 
request for temps for next week and please request someone for me tomorrow.  
Thanks
