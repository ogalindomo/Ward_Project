After using a vacation day yesterday with my car trouble, I have 11 days 
left.  I plan to roll over 5 days, but I have to take 6 days before the end 
of the year.  I would like to take the following days off:

 Friday, December 8th

 Tuesday, December 12th

 Monday, December 18th

 Wednesday, December 27th
 Thursday, December 28th
 Friday, December 29

Please let me know if these dates are acceptable to you.  Thanks.
