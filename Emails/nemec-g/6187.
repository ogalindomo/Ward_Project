I have checked Unify Service Verifications and there is no activity on this 
contract.  I also checked with the File Room for documents because there is a 
reference in the Core Main comments section of the Global record referring to 
an unexecuted amendment that extended the primary term and added evergreen

Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current 
transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  
Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they 
would prefer to terminate or void this contract.
