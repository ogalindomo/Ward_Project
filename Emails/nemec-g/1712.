Flea Market    Sat, Oct 21
The one day a year event!  Don't miss out on fantastic opportunties to
find new and used dive gear.  The Houston Hammerheads will have a table
of members' gear to sell.  Part of each sale will go into the club
treasury to support the club and as down payments on next years group
dive trips.  For more info, check out Bay Area Divers website - they are
the sponsoring dive club.  www.bayareadivers.org.

Monthly Social  Thurs, Oct 26  7:30 - 9:30 pm
The monthly social will be at Surfer's Paradise, across from the theater
in the MarqE complex on I10 off of 610.  We'll have brief club
announcements around 8:00.  The rest of the evening is open to meet
fellow divers and future dive buddies. The crowd continues to be a
mixture of newcomers, intermediates and regulars.  Tell the host/hostess
you're with the HammerHeads - we're in the party room.

I'm taking my next open water class (and nitrox class) to the Reef on
Sat-Sun, Nov 4&5 from 9:00 am until about 1:00 pm.  This will be the
last local dive of 2000.  You're welcome to come, but bring your
wetsuit.  The water temp is getting chilly!
