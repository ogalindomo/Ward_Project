YES, this is our final memo......

It is time to gather the troops and plan for the  UNITED WAY Kick-off!!  We 
hope that everyone has picked up enough T-shirts for your area. We have 1500 
ENA employees to track in this campaign and we don't want to overlook 
anyone!  If people on your floor are asking about the shirts, tell them to go 
to the Reception Desk on the 33rd floor and ask for one.  ALL ENA employees 
should be wearing our T-shirts on Wednesday! 
Remind everyone to meet at the corner of Andrews and Smith at 11:00 AM.  We 
need a huge ENA parade to walk to the Hyatt and sit together as we cheer for 
our contestants.
We hope that you have made your own United Way pledge, so that you can tell 
everyone how easy it is ON-LINE!

PLEASE FORWARD THIS MEMO TO EVERYONE IN YOUR AREA.

HELP US TO GET THE WORD OUT TO ALL ENA EMPLOYEES!!!!!
