We hope that you were able to attend the Enron Wholesale Markets Law 
Conference earlier this month.  

We would appreciate it if you could provide us with any constructive 
criticism that you have about this year's conference -- accommodations, 
program, food, activities, support staff, office backup, schedule -- anything 
at all.  This  information will be very helpful to the team that organizes 
future events, and we'll be sure to pass it on. to them.
