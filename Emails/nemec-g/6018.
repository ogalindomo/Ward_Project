I am really glad you have decided to join us for Dinner.  We will gather at 
the front desk about 7:40 pm to walk over to Delores del Rio together.  If 
you are late I will leave directions with the desk and, you can walk over.  
My understanding is that it is a very short walk from the hotel to the 
restaurant.  Hope you enjoy it, I know we did the last time.

See you tonight.

Thanks, 

Bob
