Eric & Gerald,
Pinch me.  Does the attachment say that they are "agreeable"? 

Let me know if there are any issues.

Greg

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement for FPL North Texas Project


Hello Greg,

Before the end of the year, I requested that Bill initiate contact to you
regarding our North Texas Project.  The first step in the process is to put
a Confidentiality Agreement in place.  Our attorney has reviewed your
requested changes and is agreeable.  Attached is your redlined draft with
only a slight change to reflect the specific FPLE project company related
to our future discussions.

Please execute two copies of the Agreement and return to me by courier at:

Mike McBurney
FPL Energy (FEI/JB)
700 Universe Boulevard
Juno Beach, FL  33408-2683

561-691-7546

After FPLE execution, I will return a copy for your files.

I hope to make a Houston trip in the next few weeks and would like to meet
with you during that visit.  Also, I believe Bill may have requested an
East Texas area gas quality analysis and pipeline pressure information.
This feedback would be appreciated.

Please call with any questions.

thanks,
Mike(See attached file: Houston Pipe Line CA 1-05-01.doc)
