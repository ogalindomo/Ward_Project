If you can attend this meeting on my behalf I'd appreciate it. With such 
short notice, no problem if you can't.  I'll be in the office tomorrow 
morning, barring weather travel problems.

		 Subject: Alamac meeting

Happy New Year, everybody.

As we now have 18 days left to get the Alamac deal closed, I thought it would 
be a good idea if we met Tuesday morning to get a game plan together to make 
sure all the details are being taken care of.  If you are available, let's 
meet at 10:00 in Janet's conference room (the big one next to the GenCo 
control area).

See you at 10,

Heather
