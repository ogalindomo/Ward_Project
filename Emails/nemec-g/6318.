Gerald,

Here are the documents on the Questar open seasons that Stephanie discussed 
with you.  Since the precedent agreements are binding, we would like to put 
in some sort of contingency clause to give Enron a potential out.  
Unfortunately, we only have the PAs in pdf format, so we may need to just 
write in whatever language we need.

The Denver office will be meeting with Questar on Tuesday or Wednesday to 
discuss the open season details, and we can touch base after then.  

Have a good holiday weekend.

Phil
