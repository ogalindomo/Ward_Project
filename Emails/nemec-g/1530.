Gerald,

 Here are David Marshall's comments.  Can you incorporate them into the 
contract, or should I make a first pass and send it up for your approval?

Regards,

My comments re insurnace.

Enron corporately self insures the first $2MM of it's third party liability 
risk so I suggest amending the language to state that self insurnace is a 
viable option;
The insurance language as written says that our policies (except work comp)  
apply for the benefit of CIG as an additional insured for any liability 
arising out of the work, which presumably would include situations where CIG 
may owe us an indemnity per Art. 11 

Probably the best way to address insurance is to agree to the representation 
that we will maintain insurance coverage or self insure to the levels 
specified, and agree that the insurance policy will protect CIG to the same 
extent that we have agree to indemnify them in Art. 11
