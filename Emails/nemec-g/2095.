All:

ECS will be signing Christmas cards to send to our customers tomorrow 
afternoon (sorry for the late notice).  You are invited to join in the 
festivities at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main Street) at 2:30pm.  Grinches need 
not attend, as much merriment will abound.  Come early or come late  -  hope 
to see you there!
