Per my telephone conversation with Michael Brown early this afternoon, 
attached is a new Term Sheet to which I understand David will be attaching an 
Exhibit A that outlines notional Activity Costs.  If you want to provide a 
sample Capacity Charge when delivering this document, I suggest adding a new 
Section to the Proposed PPA section and attaching an Exhibit B.

As I mentioned in my voicemail to David, Gerald Nemec can help with whateve 
changes you need to this draft.  The temporary assistant who is sitting in 
for Pat, Rachel Bryant (ext 3-9282) know how to reach me if that is necessary.

Good luck,

Steve
