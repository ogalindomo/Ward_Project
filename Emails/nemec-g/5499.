Subject: Draft of Greeley Exhibit


Paul,
I am sending you this draft of the exhibit.  I think it has all of the
elements John discussed with you on the phone this afternoon.  I will run it
by him this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  If I have any other changes
after John has looked at it, I will send the revisions to ASAP.  If you have
any questions, please feel free to give me a call.
