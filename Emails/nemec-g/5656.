FYI,

Peter del Vecchio and his wife Nair are the proud parents of Dante Valentin 
del Vecchio.  Dante's surprised early arrival was last night at 10:20 p.m. at 
St. Luke's Hospital, weighing in at 4 pounds, 8 ounces and he is 17 inches 
long.  Dad was out of town (on business in Canada) but, did make it to the 
hospital in time (10:10 p.m.).  At this notice, everyone is doing well.
