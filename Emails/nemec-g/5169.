Dear friends,

Last year you helped me and the cycling club from Dell raise almost
$15,000.00 for the National MS Society.  This year our goal is to reach
$20,000.00

Once again, I will be riding the MS150 and I would like to impose on your
generosity by asking you to make a monetary contribution to the National MS
Society by supporting the bike ride.  I will be biking over 150 miles from
Houston to Austin and your monetary pledge will help MS raise money for
research, education and care of individuals with MS.

Every hour an adult is diagnosed with MS.  Multiple sclerosis is a chronic
disease affecting the central nervous system.  Please visit their web site
at   www.ms150.org   for additional information

How can you contribute?  The process is very easy.... You may do it on line
or call me or send me an email and I can make an alternate arrangement.  If
you would like to donate online, use the following link to get to the web
