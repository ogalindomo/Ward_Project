By the time of this meeting, I will be about $10,000 richer with a 6 ft. tall 
half-clothed showgirl on each arm.  So please send Kristi my greetings!    
When upon learning I will not be in attendance, she goes into a deep state of 
depression, inform her that she had her chance and that ship has sailed.

OK, I will reconsider, but only if she grovels.

Ryan,
The Outback Pub is on Fountainview between Richmond and Westheimer.  If
you're familiar with that area on Richmond, it's near Barry's Pizza and Dave
& Buster's.

See you there,
Kristi
