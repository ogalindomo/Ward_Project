Dan Reineke is proceeding with obtaining our San Arroyo production gas 
samples upstream and downstream of the San Arroyo Wildhorse Plant.
There are 2 rental compressors in the field which are maintained by K-N 
(Wildhorse) but rental is paid by us (Enogex) @ $1200 and $1150/ month. 
He is also in the process of confirming the information which he stated 
yesterday re: the plant rate capacity, compression capacity and exactly how 
our gas flows through that system.
