Gerald,
As you know, ECS is working several deals with EES pricing.  They provided a 
draft agreement that should represent 
what would be executed between the groups.  They are looking for comments 
from us relative to the draft which I believe
is good timing since we will be closing something prior to year end 00.  

I suggested that Bo set up a short meeting with their attorney for us to meet 
and discuss.
We should be hearing from them soon.

thanks
mk

At Greg's request I am sending you a draft of what we think a contract 
between EES and ECS would entail.  We look forward to discussing this with 
you further.  MDS
