That works for me.  Tell Jerry he can call me if he needs something while you 
are gone.

Mark,
     I received your email and forwarded it to Jerry for his review. I am
sure that he will be getting back to Gerald with his comments. However, one
quick note, I will be out of the office beginning May 2 and not returning
until May 14, but you will be able to reach me on my cell phone,
918-691-2373. I suggest that we let Jerry and Gerald dot the i's and cross
the t's on the agreement and then we can have it executed and do the
release the week of May 14 - 18. Please let me know how this fits your
schedule. Thanks, Terry

Mark,  Please reviewed the attached letter.  I revised based on our
discussion with WIC and CMS.
