F.Y.I., I think Scott was targeting 10 am on Wednesday for the referenced 
meeting, but I do not know the location.

I will be in Houston and look forward to a productive meeting.  I'm attending 
a Wildhorse Shippers Meeting for the San Arroyo area producers on Tuesday 
(tomorrow) , so hopefully I'll have some useful operational information to 
contribute on Wedns.

See you then, 

Dan
