Jerry,

Attached is the revised agreement with the changes to the previous version 
you received redlined.

Please note that under Capacity Target definition I have put a seperate table 
for each facility.  When we produce the seperate actual agreements for the 
respective facilities, I will delete the table for the other facility.

I am available to discuss at your convenience.  Best regards.
