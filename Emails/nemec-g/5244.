I should have Dave Gorte's comments early in the morning.

The numbering of the two DASHs (4 for development and 4a for divestiture) 
signify the fact that the two events are concurrent, yet reading the 
development DASH then the divestiture DASH may help to see the event sequence 
better.  It's a good idea from Chip.

Thanks, and good night.
