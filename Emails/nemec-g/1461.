It was great to see so many of you at the 75th anniversay celebration in 
Galveston this past weekend.  We hope that those of you who were able to 
attend the event enjoyed the dinner and had an opportunity to use your Garden 
Dollars at the attractions.

We were proud to be able to have the history display in the Enron Building 
lobby for a couple of days.  The photos from it will be on permanent display 
at the Bammel plant.  

We are searching for the logo that was displayed on the registration table at 
Moody Gardens Hotel.  We would like to display it in our 35th floor lobby.  
If you or someone you know has seen it, please let us know where we can 
retrieve it.  You can email Lillian Carroll or call her at 3-7271.  Thanks 
for your help.
