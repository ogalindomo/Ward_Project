The attached is a monthy table w/ a summary of line pressures and production.
Take a look and see if this is what you need.
Notice the sheet called "Summary by month and average", especially the last 
few columns with averages calculated.

Remember, most of the Entrada Production went off-line beginning in 1998, 
with final production in August 99.
Call me @ 3-1888 if we need to discuss.
