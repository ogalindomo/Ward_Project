Dear Mr. Nemec:

Eric Romero faxed you comments and proposed revisions to the Professional
Services Agreement between Enron and Project Consulting on 3/28/01 and wanted
to know if you have any comments on the revisions.

Mr. Romero will be out of the office Wednesday and Thursday, so please feel
free to contact me with your comments and I will give the information to him
upon his return.

Thank you.
