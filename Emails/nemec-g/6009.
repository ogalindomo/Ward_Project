Andrew and Chris,

Please see the table below that highlights the legal documents needed to=20
close the Stagecoach transaction.  We will have all of the ECS-TGP document=
s=20
ready for Chris and I to take to the TGP meeting this Friday (the numbers i=
n=20
the compression services agreement will be left blank per G. Nemeck =01) un=
less=20
either of you says otherwise).  We are having a tough time getting EES lega=
l=20
to get their docs. over to us.  (Seems like a common theme.)

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

John
