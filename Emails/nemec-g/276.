Remember the line Clint gave when the bounty hunter wanted to take him back 
and he told Clint he we just trying to make a living.

Clint responded "Dying ain't much of a livin boy!"

Remember that.  That was awesome.

Have you guys been following the race for mayor?  There are three candidates:
 the incumbent, Lee Brown, and challengers Jack Terence, and, I'm not making
this up, "Outlaw Josey Wales IV".

I think we all know what ballot to drop, don't we?
