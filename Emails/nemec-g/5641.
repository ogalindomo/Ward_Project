Mark,

Here's an updated status report.  Please distribute within ENA.  Dave Owen
will be here today and we are scheduled to be at BCCK by about 11:00 this
morning.  Jim is in transit to Grand Junction.

Our contract landman was out all last week so not much progress was made
last week on the acquisitions.

Is there still going to be a 10:00 conference call?

Ken Krisa
