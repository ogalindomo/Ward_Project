Gerald,
I have taken a stab at some hopefully minor changes to the initial Oct. 12th 
draft of a letter agreement from
Gulf Power.  I have taken the approach that we are signing up for the PX or 
PXT tariff with the defined requirements 
for availablilty.  That leaves this agreement to focus on the facilities 
hence the "Facility Agreement".  The PX tariff 
has minimum utilization (which stipulates a 12 month rolling minimum of 75%) 
but is not specific as to the penalty.
I chose to take out the penalty language since but recognize that the penalty 
is unknown.  We may want to define
this but I expect that they will define it at the highest level if we push 
the issue. 

I want to forward this back to Gulf ASAP.
