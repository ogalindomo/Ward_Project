     Gerald,

     Please review the attached files and provide comments by August 9.

     The siteag.doc is a proposed Compressor Site Agreement for the Powder
     River Basin.  This document was given to the ROW contractor by a
     landowner in the area.  In paragraph 6, I removed a sentence
     concerning the obligation to fence the site since we were instructed
     to only build a fence around the Main Station.

     The easement file contains a few modifications to accommodate future
     pipelines.  BLUE is where Ted (ROW Contractor) added something, and
     RED is where Ted suggest the wording be removed.  For example, Item
     #1, (the option) we removed because we are ready to obtain the
     easement, rather than only an option.  Item #16 was added to address a
     future line.

     Sincerely,

     Pam Sherman
