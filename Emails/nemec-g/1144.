Do you have an idea of when we'll see the first turn of the PSA?  I ask 
because it appears that Williams will not agree to the issuance of a press 
release until we receive special approval from the audit committee and the 
definitive agreement is executed.
Is it possible to have the PSA ready to execute on the 21st or 22nd and 
drafted such that we close upon completion of due diligence and receipt of 
HSR approval (early termination?). 

Thanks.  Eva.
