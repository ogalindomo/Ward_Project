Now available on the intranet is the EWS Legal Website, called "LegalOnline" 
and found at http://legalonline.corp.enron.com. 

The site was developed in accordance with our overall technology plan to 
provide a means of organization and communication within our department.  At 
the present time, there are a few areas still under construction - Phase II 
areas - and other areas that have been reserved for future growth.  The 
information currently provided is base information which will be expanded 
during the later part of this quarter.  Also, suggestions and comments are 
welcome through the "Feedback" area or by e-mailing me directly.  

So take the site for a test drive and let's see what you think.

Special thanks for assistance with this project goes to Ed Hearn, Michelle 
Cash, Nony Flores, Jim Grace and Jeanette Elbertson.
