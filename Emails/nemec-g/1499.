Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns' schedule
for comparison.

          Gators              Longhorns
Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas

Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was a 
lot
of fun.

So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.
