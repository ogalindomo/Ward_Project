For Feb, gas will be flowing into NWPL.

The VPP vol is 1,815/d, and the excess piece is 571/d.  The entire excess 
piece will be priced at Gas Daily - South of Green River, less $0.04.  I know 
we spoke
 about pricing the excess a portion at an IFGMR price, and a portion at Gas 
Daily, however, the volumes are small and using 50/50 pricing, then 285 would 
be at 
one price  and 285 is at the other, and this is really too small to track.  
So, I told the trader to price it all at Gas Daily.  When the volumes are 
bigger - the excess vols,
then we can break it out.
