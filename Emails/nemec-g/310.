Hello Gerald,

Attached is the estimate for the connection mentioned above to the Texoma 30" 
line (3080) in Gregg County, TX..  I have not qualified the dollar amount as 
to what type of communication package will be required for this installation.



I did not remember Eric's last name so could you forward this to him.

Thanks,
Reid
