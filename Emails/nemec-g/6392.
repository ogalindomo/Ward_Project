 Gerald,
 Here is the Term Sheet that has been submitted to Oakhill for some time.  

 It should reflect the following:

 7000 hp ( 2 units rated at 3500 hp each)
 Hanover is expected to package, install and finance for ECS under a 10 yr 
contract
 ECS will basically Lease - Purchase from Hanover

 Hanover will provide all Maintenance for the contract term for a defined 
cost.  (I'm working the cost with Hanover)
 
 Power provider = Rusk County Electric Cooperative
 Rate structure = special structure whereby RCEC commits to term fixed T&D, 
fixed Generation and fixed Ancillary Services
  (EES and ENA are basically a no bid on providing the power into SWEPCO & 
RCEC)
