Can you or your environmental guy attend this meeting?  If so, please call 
Heather Kroll and ask her to fax you a copy of the Phase II report.  I'm 
concerned about what the recomendation of installing monitoring wells at the 
2 cogen sites does to our current allocation of environmental risk. That's 
not a possibility contemplated by either the LOI or the current drafts of the 
2 separate Securities Purchase Agreements.  I'll call you from the road.
