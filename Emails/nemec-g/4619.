The Insurance Luncheon/Presentation  is TODAY.  Lunch will be served at 
11:30, with the presentation beginning around noon.  We have reserved The 
Houston Room at 601 Jefferson (The Kellogg Building), Level A.

Walking Directions:  Exit the Enron Building, go to the right to Pease (1-1/2 
blocks) and turn left.  The Kellogg Building is directly across from the YMCA 
on Pease.  Go down the escalator one level to Level A and the Houston Room 
will be directly in front of you.

You can also reach The Kellogg Building through the tunnel and skywalks.  
Take the tunnel to the Continental Building and then the skywalks will take 
you the rest of the way.

Shuttle Riders:  The Enron Shuttle will be leaving at approximately 11:15.  
The Shuttle will hold a maximum of 30 people, so hopefully the weather will 
clear up and some of you will want to walk the 1-1/2 blocks.  If more than 30 
people want to take the Shuttle, he will be making a second trip at about 
11:30-11:35.

SEE YOU THERE!
