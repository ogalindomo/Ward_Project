Subject: BWGP - BCCK and Gas Processing Agreement


Audrey,

I think it may be appropriate to schedule a meeting with BCCK again.  Review
of schedule, compression bids, equipment purchase orders.  I thought we
would have lots of stuff on order by now.

Also, I can't remember if I discussed with you - I would like to develop
with your and Gerald's assistance a third party gas processing agreement for
the BWGP.  May need within the next 2-3 weeks to signup Lone Mountain.

Let's discuss.

Ken
