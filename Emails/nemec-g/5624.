Hi.

I would suggest looking for this flight on line.  Jeff made the reservation
with his travel agent and this approach is more expensive.  I looked on
travelocity last night and the difference was almost 100 dollars less.  Ugh.
So frustrating.  Anyway, I don't know if you can get the same flight on line,
but it is worth a try.
