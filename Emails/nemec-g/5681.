Friends:

The attachment is an invitation to the initial reception for Young 
Professionals for Aspiring Youth, which is a new group that I'm helping 
organize.  Aspiring Youth is an after school mentoring program for middle 
school kids.  More information on Aspiring Youth is at  www.aspiringyouth.org.

The reception itself should be great.  Its at the Devin Borden Hiram Butler 
Art Gallery,  which is really fantastic.

Hope you can be there.

Please fell free to pass this on to whomever you think might be interested.

Additional Information about YPAY:

Aspiring Youth is a locally-founded 501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization that operates innovative programs for at-risk youth,
such as Aspiring Youth? After-School Programs, the Take A Student To your
Employment (TASTE?) Program, College for a Day Program and the "Positive
Youth Development" TV show. More than 500 students from nine Houston-area
middle schools will participate during the 2000-2001 school year.  For
additional information, please see Aspiring Youth's website at
www.aspiringyouth.org

The goal of YPAY is to involve Houston's young professional community in
these fabulous programs and demonstrate by word and deed what it takes to
be successful in the professional world.  Many of the children that attend
Aspiring Youth's programs have never met or seen a doctor, lawyer,
accountant, banker or engineer or have any conception of what it is like to
work in professional atmosphere.  Your participation in YPAY will provide
these youth aspiring to such jobs with badly needed positive role models
and better acquaint them for the challenges and effort required to achieve
success in the professional world.  In the process, you just might meet
some interesting people and have a good time.  A proposed mission statement
is attached below.

At present, we envision that YPAY will not only contribute volunteers to
Aspiring Youth's programs, but also have periodic social events and
establish a quarterly speakers series.
