Slight change.  Mark doesn't want this to be an affidavit, per se.  This=20
doesn't need to be a sworn, deposition-like document.  He wants a signed=20
letter/statement covering the following four points (in numbered bullets or=
=20
otherwise):

1. On 29 September, 2000, 3 units at the Bammel Site were scheduled to be=

running during the Baseline Period. =20
2. These units were NOT running during the Baseline Period due to an=20
unanticipated filming session for HPL=01,s 75th Anniversary celebration.
3. The units were left off during the Curtailment Period in an effort to he=
lp=20
reduce Reliant=01,s demand load.
4. In order to make up for lost operations during the Curtailment Period, t=

units were run after the Curtailment was finished.

do it.  Sorry for the confusion.  Call me w/questions.
