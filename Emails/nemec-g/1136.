Gerald,

I'm real happy to let you handle this totally yourself.  Let me know if you 
want or need any help.

Steve

I would like to set up a meeting with one of you to talk about EOL 
transportation business.  Lauri and I could come by and show you what we 
intend to do and some of the information we have gathered.  We will need your 
help to get a GTC / contract together that will cover the business we intend 
to do.  EDG
