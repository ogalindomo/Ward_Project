Dear Tom,

Regarding regulatory filings for HPL, I routinely send a P-5 report, with a 
cover letter from Gerald Nemec and a form signed by Barbara Gray (as Vice 
President, General Counsel, Assets, and Secretary of HPL), to the Texas 
Railroad Commission during April of every year.  The P-5 report for HPL is 
due by May 1.

Best wishes,
Mary
