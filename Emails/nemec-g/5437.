Dear Mr. Gerald Nemec,

I am a first year MBA student at the Wharton School. As part of a consulting 
class project, I need to survey the legal departments of big corporations to 
get a sense of how they are organized. Kate Lucus said that you might be able 
to help me.
I need to conduct a telephone interview with someone in the legal department 
who can answer questions with regard to the legal department's organization 
and structure. To make things easier and give you a sense of what we are 
looking for, I have attached a copy of the questions we are seeking to 
answer. I understand that you are extremely busy so I do not expect you to 
fill out the forms. I am sending these questions as a way of letting you know 
what we are looking for during the interview. I understand that in some cases 
you may not have an answer to all the questions, that is okay. We are seeking 
as much information as possible.
Thank you for your time and kind consideration.
Sincerely,
Wendy-Lynn McClean
