At your request, I have set-up a conference call with
AEC and West Florida Electric for 10:30 am on Monday.
I am not aware of your schedules and I attempted to send
invitations but my computer system seems to have trouble
with that process.  You may or may not have received the notice.

Please confirm that you are available and we probably need
to discuss prior to the conference call.  

Thanks
mk
