The Resolution Center is taking the next step of ensuring we are providing 
the service you, our customer, are looking for.  As of Wednesday September 
20th, with each call made to the Resolution Center, an email survey will be 
sent out upon closure of the ticket.  Please take the time to fill out the 
survey and let us know how we are doing.  We will post these results 
quarterly on our web page and show exactly how well we are doing.  We have 
attached a copy of the survey for your viewing.

Thank you again for your continued support.
