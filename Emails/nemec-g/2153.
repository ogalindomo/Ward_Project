Paul,


Attached is the Reserve Report form 9/00 with a qualifier of rr900, a letter
explaning why production has dropped, a spreadsheet with updated production
vs. line pressures and a net back calculation sheet (utilized for wellhead
pricing) . As soon as I get the updated LOE's, I will send them to you.

Jim
