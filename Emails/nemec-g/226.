that I have not been a good friend to you lately.  You deserve to be treated
better.  I know I am being totally selfish but at the same time can't seem to
stop myself.  I wish I knew of a way to make things between us better.
Sometimes I feel like this last three months has just been a dream that I am
going to wake up from and everything will be back the way it was before we
started drifting apart.  I can't tell you enough how sorry I am for not 
talking
to you before things got so twisted.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to find 
my
way back to you now.  I know you find it hard to believe anything I say, but I
hope you know that I loved you more than anything when we got married and I
still love you even now.  You are a wonderful, caring, beautiful person that I
am so very glad to have had in my life.  I will never forget you and will 
always
have a special place in my heart for you.  This may seem like this is easy for
me, but it isn't.  I have just been struggling with this longer than you have.
I never wanted this to happen, I wanted to love you for the rest of my life 
and
make our marriage a priority.  I am sorry I failed you.

As far away as it seems now, I hope we can continue to be friends someday.

Lisa
