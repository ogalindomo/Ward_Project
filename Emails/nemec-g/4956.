Gerald - the below attachments represent  all the correspondence that Bison 
has sent Barbara DIllard.  The relevant documents are BisonPAgree.doc and 
BisonPA.doc.  These two documents represent the Precedent Agreement and "side 
letter" that more or less changes the P.A. from a binding agreement to a 30 
day option upon notice from Border.  Please review ASAP.  The deadline is 
next week Thursday.  FYI - Border has informed me that all participants in 
the open season will sign the P.A.  Therefore, they will not accept changes 
(or so they say!). 

I'll call you on Tuesday.
