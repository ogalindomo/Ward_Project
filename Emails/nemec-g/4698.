Here is the information on the ski trip.  We still have room for two more
people if you know of some else who may be interested...

The house is rented for March 8-13th  (Lake view and Hot Jacuzzi tub on the
back)
The cost of the house is $280/person for the whole duration ( maybe less, I
am working on discount)
The plane fair is between $200.00 - $270.00 depending on who you fly with
There is a shuttle from the Airport to Tahoe for $45.00 round trip and we
may rent a mini van for moving around the city.
Food and lift ticks vary on how much you ski and where we go eat.
Casino expending money not included!!! ;o)

Let me know if you need additional information.

Are you still interested? Drop me a note!!!

Thanks,
