Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been
swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does
a flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am
planning on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.

I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than
the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty
intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will
probably go.

Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns'
schedule
for comparison.

          Gators              Longhorns
Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas

Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was
a lot
of fun.

So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.
