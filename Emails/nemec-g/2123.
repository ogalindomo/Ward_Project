Gerald,  Upon your review please forward any comments to me and Mike Smith.  
After meeting with Mark Knippa this morning, we are targeting tomorrow 
morning (12/7/00) for execution of the master agreement.

In addition to the Master, I will forward you the TA as it relates to the 
Blackwater deal later today.  EES plans to present executable pricing for 
Blackwater as early as tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks

Bo
