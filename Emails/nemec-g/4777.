Hi Gerald.  I'm the deal lawyer (Portland based) on our Pastoria power plant 
development project in California, which we are trying to sell to Calpine.  I 
understand from Ron Coker and Stephanie Miller that you are handling the 
legal aspects of the  transportation and other arrangements for the gas 
supply to the project.  Could we talk sometime today so that I can gain a 
better understanding of the gas transactions overall, and, specifically, how 
to deal with them in our purchase agreement with Calpine?  I could do a call 
between 1:30 and 3:30 your time, or 5:00 or after your time.

Thanks much,
Karen
