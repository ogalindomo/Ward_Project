I am inquiring about the status of the Oneok Westex Transmission, Inc. 
contract that was forwarded to you for your review on October 13, 2000.  I 
believe that Stacey Neuweiler wanted you to review this contract before it 
was used.  However, Stacey Neuweiler is no longer employed with Enron North 
America Corp. and I still have this contract as outstanding to route for 
signatures.


Please let me know the status of this contract.


Thank you for your prompt attention in this matter.
