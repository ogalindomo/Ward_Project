You are a little late, but you did remember.  The fact you remembered
at all is pretty good for a guy.  I had a great b-day with Will and
then later his family took me out.  I love being the only girl in
this family.  It sounds like you have been busy.  Anything
interesting going on in your life?  Have you been in town?  Take
care.  Thanks for remembering! I love you bro!!
