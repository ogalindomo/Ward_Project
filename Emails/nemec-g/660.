Last call for donations for Bob's Grandmother's fund!  We are donating the 
monies collected to the nursing home Bob's Grandmother lived in.  An engraved 
plaque will be given to Bob and his wife as a remembrance of our  (and 
Enron's matching!) donation.  I will be picking up the plaque tonight after 
work.

A heartfelt thank you to those of you who have contributed thus far.  I know 
Bob will be touched!  

-Becky


P.S.  To my knowledge, Bob is not aware that we are doing this.  Let's keep 
it a surprise if we can!
