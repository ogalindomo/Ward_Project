I know your letter stated that you would accept no changes. However, there a 
a few items we would like for your attorney to review.

I am leaving the office today around noon my time to catch a plane to Salt 
Lake (meeting with Candace). Let's discuss ASAP!!!

REgards,

Stephanie

Stephanie,  I reviewed the Confid. Agreement.  The attached riders need to be 
added to the agreement and the term should not exceed 2 years.

Let me know if you want to discuss or have questions.
