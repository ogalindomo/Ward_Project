Delivery

Please find attached the cost estimate for the subject project.  In addition, 
please find out from the deal maker the correct Income Tax Gross-Up Charge.  
I will include the Income Tax Gross-Up charge in the total cost on the Work 
Order Authorization as soon as you let me know the percentage.  If you have 
any questions, please feel free to drop by.



Thanks,

Rodney
