I was looking through some old e-mails and realized that Scott forwarded me
the same e-mail that he sent to Renee...the one that I forwarded to you to
show you.  I guess it really wasn't meant just for her.  I feel so sorry for
her at this moment.  When she got that e-mail, she called and told me that
she had just received the sweetest e-mail from Scott.  Well, I guess several
people did!
