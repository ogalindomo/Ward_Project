Good Afternoon all!

Just a reminder that I will be in orientation on Monday, April 23rd.  Levon 
Wilson at x39282, is my backup assistant.  There will be a temp at my desk, 
should you have any administrative needs while I am away.  I will return to 
the office on Tuesday, at my regular time.  Thank you for your attention to 
this matter.  

Regards,
Keegan
