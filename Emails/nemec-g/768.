Attached is a copy of the Timber Management Agreement with the revisions you 
asked me to make.  I still have not inserted the address of Southern 
Timbergrowers and I will probably come by later to confirm the italicized 
portions (things we needed to find out from Ms. Bywaters).  I hope this is up 
to your unyielding standards of perfection. If not, Eric has volunteered to 
prepare the agreement all over from scratch.
