Gerald, here is the address I have for Jere.  I was discussing this with him 
today.  
Lets get it over to them so we can get the monitoring system going.  He 
indicated
that Tri-State is in the process of changing/modifying how they monitor and 
charge
for demand or peaking service.  I'm real interested to see what this is.  

Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to
monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement).  The 
resources that
we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, 
EES and ET&S.  It's going to be money out of ECS's pocket I believe despite 
the fact
that it was part of our agreement with EE&CC for the turnkey construction 
quote.  I also
need to discuss with Courtney since he was heading up this effort.  

We may need to review exactly what our obligations are under the agreement.  
Oh, by
the way, TW is developing an expansion of Gallup to up the system to a full 
12,000 hp
from 10,000.

Jere, 

 I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.  What is 
your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks.
