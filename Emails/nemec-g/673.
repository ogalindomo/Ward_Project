Attached for your review is a draft of the Amendments to the Gallup LLC 
investment documents to reflect increased purchase price for ECS Gallup LLC 
interest sold to ECHO.  Please note that there are four blanks that need to 
be filled in (one on page 1, two on page 3 (from Flow of Funds memo) and one 
on Exhibit A (need value of contributed Gallup assets to set ECS capital 
contribution amount)). Let me know your comments.  Stephanie, I believe we 
can forward attached to Patty and her counsel for simultaneous review but 
will let you make that call.  

FYI, I am working from out of town on business but check voice mail (during 
day) and e-mail (at night). I should be back in office this Friday but can 
handle matters through these media until then.

Regards, NJD
