Gerald,
As we discussed, I am forwarding via interofice a copy of the Janauary 3, 
2001 letter which was sent by Engineered Carbons, Inc., A division of 
Ameripol Synpol Corporation regarding a claim for damages incurred in 
December 2000.   The claim may be an associated effect of the A/S pipeline 
event last month.  I have also attached Gas Sales contract 96018213 for firm 
sales at meter # 8055 to Engineered Carbons.

Any Triple Lutz coordination required?

Thanks,
Greg
