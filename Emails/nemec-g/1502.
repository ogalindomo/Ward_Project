		 Subject: Proposed Revision to PSA

Shonnie,
 As a result of discussion with our partner Williams,  one revision to the 
PSA is requested:
 
 In section 8.2 Seller's Rights.  line two insert "wholly-owned" between 
"its" and "subsidiaries".   This mirrors the language in 8.1 Purchaser's 
Rights.

 Thanks.  Eva.
