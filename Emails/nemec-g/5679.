Ken,  I have read through the agreement.  I think this agreement need some 
fairly significant revisions.  It is extremely one-sided as currently 
written.  I will write up my comments and get those to you early next week.

Gerald,

Have you had a chance to look at the Compressor Rental Agreement for the
Badger Wash Gas Plant?
