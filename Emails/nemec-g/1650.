 Patricia Casey, a partner in Haynes and Boone's litigation section, has 
offered to give a continuing education presentation "Guide to Principles of 
the Attorney-Client and Work Product Privileges" to interested Houston-based 
Enron lawyers.  The presentation will be held Thursday, October 12th in the 
Forum at 2 Allen Center, located on the 12th Floor from 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 
a.m.

 The seating in the Forum is limited to 60 persons, therefore, please RSVP to 
Robin Jordan via email or phone x33246 if you would like to attend this 
session.  Due to the number of in-house attorneys, if interest is high, the 
presentation will be given again.
