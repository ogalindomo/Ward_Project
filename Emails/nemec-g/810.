I have heard back from counsel to NatWest (Bracewell) and ECHO (Porter & 
Hedges).  They have had no comments on the amendment documents.  NatWest has 
requested from ECHO a letter containing the following:  (1) a request for 
NatWest's consent to the amendments, (2) a brief description of the reason 
for the amendments, and (3) confirmation that the amendments will not reduce 
the LLC's distributions which would have been made to ECHO absent the 
amendments.  ECHO's counsel has in turn requested Enron for a letter to ECHO 
containing items (2) and (3) above.  ECHO proposes to attach Enron's letter 
to ECHO's letter to NatWest.  If you are agreeable to such a letter to ECHO, 
I am happy to help the appropriate person from our group prepare it.  Please 
let me know.  Regards, NJD
