Thought I would send you these pictures! 

The first one was taken by surprise and then I thought I would actually pose 
for the second one!? They were walking around taking pictures for some 
unknown reason and then they sent them to me!

I know it's not as cool as the Quiet Riot picture, but then again...any 
picture with me in it is cool...Right?
