Steve,  Let's take out the reference to approaching the FERC in this letter.  
I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and 
while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response 
little reason to believe otherwise.  Suggest that any further delay would 
require us to explore all our options for access into CMS.

At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to 
go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.   Let me know if you want to 
discuss this further.
