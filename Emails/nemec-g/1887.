Make sure he knows that the 2nd contracts included the provision for Huber to 
take assignment of the contracts.  So they are legally bound and we are in 
the process of getting the pipelines approvals and drafting definitive 
agreements.  I will have my comments to you today on the contract and I would 
like to be able to get all the docs to Huber on Monday morning the 13 of 
Nov.  I will be in Houston on the morning of the 10th and am available to 
meet with you to finalize any last items.  Brian stone of Huber is planning 
on being in our office the 14th or 15th to discuss any of the details and I 
anticipate having all this done by the end of the month.  Please reassure 
Bill of that.
