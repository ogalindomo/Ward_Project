I made the call.  I called Lisa to get her to fax me some paperwork to get my 
car out of the wrecker lot.

We got our phone bill yesterday and there was a call to Great Britain on it.
It was made on Christmas eve at 12:47PM. I don't think we made it but am
just checking to see if any of you'll did. I think you'll all were still
asleep then. It was for 11 minutes for $11.00. Let me know. I need to yell
at the phone scompany.   See you'll later love MOM.
