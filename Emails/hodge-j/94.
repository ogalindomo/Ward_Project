Subject: ENA ESTIMATES UPDATE

DENNIS I SENT PAMPANO, DEERFIELD, AND MIDWAY ESTIMATES TO TIM THOMAS TODAY 
FOR HIS REVIEW - THEY WERE ALL ABOVE THE $1MM THRESHOLD REQUIRED BY TIM & 
MIKE SMITH'S REVIEW.  I TOLD HIM I NEED THEM BACK TOMORROW.  I'LL TRY TO 
FINISH CERTOSA BY TOMORROW, FOLLOWED BY CORBETT ON THURSDAY.
