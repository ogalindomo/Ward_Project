You are right.  Once this is assigned it cannot be used by ENA.  If everyone 
is fine with that, then there should be no issues.

If it is OK w/ Legal, then it is OK w/ me. The only question I have is that 
if we assign it to ENA Upstream, can they still do business w/ ENA..? (That's 
why we were doing a new one anyway...plus I don't think the old one had our 
riders)..., but again, if it is OK w/ you, it is OK w/me!

Jill,

Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with 
ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.  The GISB at issue was acquired from 
Columbia Energy Services.   In light of this there would be no need for a new 
GISB with Pioneer.  

To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.
