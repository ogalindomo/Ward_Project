John,

LIG is the only pipe that delivers to the LUS generation station and 
therefore does not have a transportation rate.  If you wanted to transport to 
the TransLa/LIG interconnect, you would need to get a rate from LIG.  The 
contact at LIG is Bud Elkins at 832-397-3405.

Can you find out the published rate on LIG without calling them?
