I will be reviewing the 2001 Budget with Louise and Dave on Thursday.  Louise 
has already hit me up about deal flow.  I need by noon tomorrow all of the 
Not-so-hot-list deals populated.  The form includes a 'Value Estimate 2001" 
categorie.  Make sure that you complete this section.  If it is accrual, then 
put "accrual".  Under "Comments", first insert the date and then provide you 
comments.  BE very descriptive on "Description" and "comments".  Need very 
specific detail in these sections.  If you add a new deal, add a row at the 
bottom of your current list so that all of your activity is grouped 
together.  Within the "Originator Name" area put your name as well as you 
business unit, ( Producer Origination, Mid-market, etc. )

Thank you for your attention to this

Frank
