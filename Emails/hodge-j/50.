Gil,

Note that our forward curves for Transco Zone 5 (summer only) show a basis of 
$.42.  Assuming a $5.00 gas price, the commodity and fuel is $.2437 making 
Piedmont's capacity worth $.1763.  So Keith's current bid of $.19 is in the 
ballpark.  I'm still waiting to hear back from LG&E.   Southern Co. plans on 
getting back with me on this early next week as is Tenaska/PECO as you know.
