Brian:

I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:

 1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price 
alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial
      resolutions to avoid the reopener.

 2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is 
defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.

Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to 
finalize this with you.

Thanks, Jeff
