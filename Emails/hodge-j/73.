Subject: Southern Natural Contracts

Enron North America acquires firm transportation and storage capacity on 
Southern Natural through the supply/asset management relationship with 
Atlanta retail marketer, The New Power Company.  The New Power Company, an 
Enron affiliate, is assigned capacity by Atlanta Gas Light for New Power's 
use in serving Atlanta residential and commercial customers.  Enron North 
America does not hold any other long-term firm capacity on Southern Natural.  
However, Enron North America does have interruptible transportation and 
storage contracts on Southern Natural.  The IT contract allows Enron North 
America to receive gas from all active receipt points on Southern Natural's 
system and deliver gas to all active delivery points on Southern Natural's 
system.
