		 Subject: Response Needed - Small Business Admin. Evaluation of Enron's 
Subcontracting Program

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."
