Jeff - Mary Klyasheff has passed on the review of the DynegyDirect 
Registration Documents to Fred Jacobsen at Peoples Energy.  I know that as of 
today he has not reviewed the documents.  Therefore, I am certain that we are 
farther along in the process.  Can you coordinate with Fred to figure out the 
most efficient and expedient method for review and approval?  His e-mail is 
f.jacobsen@pecorp.com and his phone is 312-240-7284.

As always, Thanks.

Gregg
