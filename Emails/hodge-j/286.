Jeff,

I spoke with Bill B in credit this morning - currently, his main concern with 
Stoneville is the collateral issue.  We had assumed that Stoneville will have 
no credit line and all potential mark-to-market changes would be taken care 
of through rehypothecation (just like Chase).  However, we need to address 
the credit risk of Stoneville between when the margin call occurs and when 
the rehypothecation occurs.  He was also concerned where these 
rehypothecation procedures would be documented.  Let me know, but as I 
understand it, the Chase agreement should be a good format for this master 
agreement.  Thanks.

Michael
