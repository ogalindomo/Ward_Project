Let's talk to John Hodge about that, They deal we did wih CP&L is strucured 
as follows:

April - October 01
Location:         Transco, Z5

volume:     up to 15,000 today
demand fee:    $0.09 per mmbtu  (demand fee charged on the entrie contract 
quantity regardless of quantity scheduled)
price:         Transco, NNY gas daily midpoint

I really do not have an idea of Transco zone 5 or Zone 6 demand and variable 
charges, but I know John Hodge will know.    Let's talk with him.    

Thank you!
