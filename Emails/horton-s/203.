Dear Board Task Force:

Please disregard the previous note with the same subject.

At meetings with EEI recently, they asked Jim Buccigross, Jim Templeton and I
if we could send them (Larry Brown) a letter indicating that the GISB
organization did not intend to impede the progress of EEI/CUBR in developing
Uniform Business Rules, and further that we would support such a product if a
new organization were created.  Attached is a draft letter, carefully worded
-- and probably not everything that they want.  I will try to set up a
conference call later in the week to discuss this letter, the status report
sent to you previously, and white paper, a strawman, and commitment letter to
be forwarded to you shortly.  Best Regards,  Rae
