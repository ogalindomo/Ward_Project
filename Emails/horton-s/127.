Stan,

I appreciate the support you provided as Project Cristobal progressed.  In 
addition, It has been a pleasure to work with you and your group on this 
project.  I still hold out hope that the project will be resurrected and we 
conclude this work on a positive note.  If not, I hope we have this chance on 
another opportunity in the future.

Thanks again.

Ron.
