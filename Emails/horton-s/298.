Last week we opened up the analysis of several more acquisitions.  Included 
in this group is a joint offer with ENA to acquire a 50% interest in an 
existing small CO2 business in West Texas and a  50% interest in a grassroots 
CO2 project in Wyoming.   Total initial investment for NBP would be about $28 
million.  This deal can go forward on its own if the Seller accepts the 
offer, or it can be brought into Project 20/20 if that deal closes.
