Effective immediately, John Millar will be officing with some of Stan 
Horton's Enron GPG staff to explore the opportunity
for EOTT to generate additional earnings via leasing our pipeline ROW for 
fiber optic cable.  Stan's group has
generated very substantial earnings through this initiative and we are 
excited about the possibilities for EOTT.
John will continue to be an employee of EOTT while he focuses on this project.
We will keep you posted on future developments.
