		 Subject: Audit Committee Coverage Under Corp D&O

In response to your inquiry, we have been advised by our insurance broker, 
McGriff Seibles, that our present D&O policy does not need to be amended to 
cover the 1999 Securities and Exchange Commission rules covering the duties 
of the audit committee
