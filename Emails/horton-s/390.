Dear Stan, Sheila, Mike, Jim and Jim,
Attached in .doc format is a script that can be used for the annual meeting.
Keith and I have found it particularly helpful in past years -- reminds us of
the time, introductions, people to thank, etc.  Feel free to use it as an aid
and modify your parts of the moderation however you need.  Thanks, Rae
