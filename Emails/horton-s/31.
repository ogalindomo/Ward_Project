The Gas NOPR/NOI is not on the agenda for the upcoming FERC meeting.  That's 
good news from the standpoint that it gives us time to present a proposal on 
pricing ROFR.

I also thought that you would be interested to know that Gay Friedmann and 
Lorraine Cross are meeting next week with McLane Layton (the potential FERC 
replacement).  So while Jerry Halvorsen reports that INGAA will likely take 
no position, it sounds like INGAA staffers are moving forward at meeting the 
candidates.  That makes me feel more comfortable moving forward with out 
Enron call with Ms. Layton.   (FYI - Cynthia also reports that El Paso 
actively backed Ms. Layton when her name surfaced during a prior FERC 
vacancy).
