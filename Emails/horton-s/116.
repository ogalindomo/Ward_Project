We just received the proposed Confidentiality Agreement for the Reliant asset 
disposition to be handled by Merrill Lynch.
The package will include Reliant Gas Transmission (used to be the NorAm 
system), the gathering facilities upstream of 
RGT, Mississippi River Transmission, Minnegasco, and the Ark-La LDC assets 
(does NOT include Entex).  No details
yet on transaction timing, preferred bid structure, etc.  however, I believe 
that bids for all, or any part of the package are OK.

Legal is now reviewing the CA.  The Information Packets will be forwarded to 
us as soon as it is signed. 

More to follow.
