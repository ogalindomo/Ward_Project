As we discussed and a reminder, we should quickly move to structure an 
employment agreement for David Hultsman.
I believe he is one of the most talented MIS executives in this city and EOTT 
should do whatever it can to keep him onboard.
Stan, if you concur, I will ask David to give me the some idea of what he 
would like to see in the way of terms and conditions.
thanks,  mike
