Dana-
Here is the list of required deliverables that I gave to ArthurAndersen when 
you were out of town on May 10th.

If you (or any of the cc's) have any suggested additions or changes to this 
list, please send them to Shelly.  Shelly will work with Lori to get the 
revised deliverable list to ArthurAndersen ASAP.

Lori-
Please ask J.R. Sult to commit to a completion target date.

Thanks
Mike
