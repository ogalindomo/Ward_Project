 Yesterday, EOTT submitted a non-binding bid for the stock of APL along with 
our comments on the stock purchase agreement.  Copies of both are attached 
for your review.  The offer price has been removed from the letter.  We 
haven't heard anything form the invesment bankers but did receive two faxes 
late last night.  The first was the receipt of the disclosure schedules.  The 
second was the waiver by Phillips of their ROFR on Seaway for the year 2000.  
This simplies the transaction immensely.
 I keep you informed of any news but wanted to extend my appreciation to 
everyone for their hard work during this process and the transition from 
Northern Border as a buyer to EOTT.
 thanks
