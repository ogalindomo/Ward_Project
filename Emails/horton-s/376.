Today I received a somewhat unpleasant letter from Mr. Mark Wilson at Koch.  
Koch is saying that it has been damaged by the delay in the registration of 
its EOTT common units and is making veiled threats of legal action against 
EOTT.  The tone of Mr. Wilson's letter is inappropriate in my view.  I will 
send each of you a copy of Mr. Wilson's letter and I will work with Bob Baird 
in framing an appropriate response from EOTT.  At this juncture, since it now 
appears that it will be at least several more weeks before we know whether 
the Phoenix deal will become "disclosable,"  it might make sense to advise 
Koch about Phoenix on the condition of strict confidentiality (Dana's 
suggestion).  Bob, could we do this?  If we could do this, Koch would be able 
to appreciate the dilemma posed by the Phoenix deal and how this impacts the 
S-1 filing.  SWD
