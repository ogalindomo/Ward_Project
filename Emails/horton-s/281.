As of this morning, we have not yet received a response from the Navajo 
Nation.  Also, per my follow up conversations with Larry Ruzow after the 
conference call on Wednesday, it appears that at least 3 task force members 
--one council member, the Task Force Chairman and the liaison between the 
Task Force and the President's office --will not be available for Tuesday's 
meeting.
