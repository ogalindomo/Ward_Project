I have just received an advisory that EPA Administrator Carol Browner and 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman will hold a press conference at 1:30 EST 
today (Monday 3/20) to announce Administration plans to eliminate the use of 
MTBE in gasoline.

I will report to you as soon as we receive more details about the 
Administration's proposal.
