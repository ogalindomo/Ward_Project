Stan:  You are right one target with your question: Does he have the desire, 
energy, determination, self-confidence and perserverance to drive through the 
many, many  changes that are necessary?  As David and Dana can tell you, 
these EOTT characters can really wear you down.
I assure that I will not attempt to bring Cttty into the organization until 
we are absolutely convinced that the answer to your question and my question 
is a resounding "YES"!.

Mike:

Cutty seems like he would be a good addition to EOTT.  He certainly has a 
diverse background.  The key question being..."Is he a 'change agent' that 
can lead an organization the size of EOTT"?
