Louie:  I think the letter to Mr. Trujillo is excellent, particularly as it 
follows on the strategy suggested by Zaman.  It signals that there is no 
sense in talking unless we can resolve compensation issues, but suggests 
there will be other issues we need to discuss.  If we want to emphasize that 
we cannot acquiesce in their terms and conditions, we could insert to the 
second sentence in the final paragraph of the letter: "It would seem best to 
schedule a meeting with the entire Task Force to discuss consideration and 
other key issues once the Nation has responded to this portion of 
Transwestern's offer."  Please raise any other questions you may have.  Lynn
