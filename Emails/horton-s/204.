Dear Board Task Force:

Attached is the white paper, revised with process information and three pages
on public-private partnerships as an intro.  The attachment totals 25 pages
in length.  It is a good document for introducing someone to GISB.  The first
three pages on public private partnerships highlights our credibility with
the FERC.  The executive summary and conclusion in the next part of the
report can be read separately -- for those who don't want to read the whole
report.
