Attached is a copy of the press release describing the gas rule. 




I've heard through the grapevine that pipelines (not GPG) are already 
complaining that there
is  "nothing in it for pipelines."   I think we should be cautious about 
being so critical before we have even seen
the rule itself.  After all, many of the items in the rule are there at the 
pipelines request (seasonal & term-differentiated rates).    

I hope to be able to send out a summary on Friday.
