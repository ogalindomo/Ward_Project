Spoke with David Harvin, a senior litigator at V&E.  He believes it would be 
prudent to call it an "apparent theft" in the two places where" theft" 
appears in the release.  Accordingly, this change should be made and the 
"analysts" script should be revised accordingly.  Please advise if there are 
any questions. Thanks.  SWD
