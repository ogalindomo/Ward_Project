Dear Board Members,

Attached in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format is a report from the Board Task Force
regarding its activities to date on GISB's scope.  The report includes a
recommendation and a brief synopsis of the meetings held so far.  This report
will also be included in your Board materials which should be distributed
shortly.

In addition, several companies have filed comments regarding the need for,
scope and governance of a new standards organization.  Because of the length
of the comments, they are not included in this attachment, but can be
downloaded from our web site (www.gisb.org).

For the comments submitted on May 22 regarding the governance meeting held on
April 26, Columbia Distribution Companies, Williams Gas Pipeline, Semco
Energy Gas Company, Skipping Stone, and CMS Energy responded with written
comments in addition to comments submitted previously by Reliant Energy and
Wisconsin Public Service Company.

For the comments submitted for the scope meeting held on April 17,  Alliant
Energy, CMS Energy, PSE&G, Reliant Energy and Semco Energy Gas Company
responded with written comments.  For the introductory meeting held on
February 14, twenty-nine companies provided comments.

Please let our office know if you have any difficulty retrieving this
information.  I look forward to seeing you on June 8 in Houston.

Best Regards,  Rae
