Dear Sheila, Mike, Stan, Jim, Keith and Jim,

Attached are the biographies for the speakers and moderators for our annual
meeting.  Sorry for the delay, but we didn't get all of them until this
afternoon.  Keith -- we are still missing Paula Miles and will try to get one
for her before the end of Friday.  Many thanks for helping us with this
annual meeting.

Thanks, Rae
