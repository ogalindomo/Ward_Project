As suspected, the Senate Environment Committee's scheduled markup of MTBE 
legislation will not take place on Wednesday, July 26. 

The next possible Committee markup dates include:  September 7, 2000, or more 
likely, some time during the week of September 11, 2000.

We will be working during the month of August to refine our proposed 
amendments, and to work with Senate staff and other stakeholder groups 
(refiners, environmentalists) to gain support for our positions.

I will keep you posted as developments occur.
