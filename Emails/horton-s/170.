Dear Board Task Force --
Attached is an agenda for the upcoming meeting on April 17.  It is patterned
from the agenda used in the Committee of the Whole meetings held in
Washington in 1993/94 where GISB scope was discussed.  Please let me know if
you have any changes.  Both Bob Gee and Jerry Langdon have agreed to open the
meeting.  Beginning at 1 PM and ending at 6 PM should allow many to get in
and out of Washington on the same day.    Best Regards, Rae
