FYI -
As you may have noticed EOTT shares have been trading down over the past 
several days (Friday's close was 12 3/4 vs. today's close of 11 7/8).  Some 
of the weakness may be related to concern over the Midland pipeline leak that 
occurred several weeks ago.  A message was posted on the Yahoo message board 
on 2/11 noting the EOTT has recently had "a couple of BAD pipeline leaks in 
West Texas/New Mexico".  I did not recieve any questions on the Midland leak 
until today.  In addition, Jeanine Kim with PaineWebber (Ron Barone's 
analyst) called today and indicated they had several calls on the leak and on 
the reported loss of one of EOTT's top traders in Midland.

I have not had any other calls pointing to other rumors that might explain 
the weakness.

The volumes traded over the last several days does not appear unusual, with 
today's volume reported at 44,400 units.
