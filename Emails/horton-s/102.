From Jenny Rub and Shelley Corman:

Attached is an updated version of the "Project Why" task force document 
incorporating suggestions we have received from Julia White and John 
Pravetto.  We have not received any other feedback on the scope document.  

Please note that the revised project document also includes a proposed work 
plan.   It is important that we finalize the scope/work plan early next week, 
as we have many project activities planned for March.
