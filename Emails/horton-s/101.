Dear Board of Directors,
The material for the meeting is attached and a printed copy should be in your
offices on Monday.  The material for the book was delayed to include one of
the reports, which completed by the task force yesterday night.  The .pdf
version attached here, will be posted and can be navigated easily using
bookmarks.  It is 40 pages in length, with six sections.  Please feel free to
call if you have any questions on the material.  Best Regards,  Rae
