I will be out of the office until Thursday, but I hope to have a response to 
many of the questions in this email on Thursday.  Overall, I think the work 
flow is fine, but I think we need more dialog with the insurance folks about 
how we respond to future leaks when we need ENTRIX personnel on site quickly, 
and about the scope of work that AIG would authorize ENTRIX to do in an 
initial site assessment.  I will cover these items in my response to the 
questions.

Rich Myers is working on a summary of expenses per work authorization order, 
but be aware that some of the orders are not related to TX-NMX sites.  Also, 
by the way, we get the top ENTRIX discount on hourly rates, so the rates that 
AIG pays is slightly higher than ours.
