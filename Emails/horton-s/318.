Stan:
 Attached is a redraft of the organization announcement, incorporating 
mention of Bob Hall's departure and including Danny McCarty's rewrite of the 
second paragraph.
 I also am including a draft of an announcement to Omaha and Houston 
employees regarding the meetings you have scheduled on the 17th and 18th, 
respectively.  We would propose to send it out, via e-mail, Thursday 
afternoon for deliver Friday morning.  I'd like your approval of the wording 
of the annoucement as well as the timing associated with sending ti.
 Finally, fyi, I've included what I propose to send out Friday, via e-mail, 
to all vice presidents of GPG companies and divisions, inviting them to your 
staff meeting Monday morning.
   d.s.
