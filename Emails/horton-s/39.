John,  Based on what Dana and I heard at Stan's Strategic session yesterday, 
it appears you have made significant progress in creating a substantial  
value opportunity for GPG re: subject.

Following up on Stan's suggestion, Dana, John Millar and I would like to meet 
with you at your earliest convenience to see how EOTT can also tap it to this 
opportunity.  I look forward to hearing from you.  thanks,  mike
