Stan, I just want to go on record to tell you how much respect I have for you 
as an individual and as a highly accomplished 
executive.  You have handled this current situation extremely professionally 
while also exhibiting a considerable amount of understanding and compassion.  
It is easy to see why Ken, Jeff and Joe hold you in such high regard.

  All of the management of EOTT is benefiting from your leadership and 
business acumen.  I am absolutely convinced that EOTT is going to reach it's 
full potential in the not too distant future.

Thanks for all that you have done and are doing!  mike
