Dear Editorial Review Board Members,

Attached please find the survey to be sent to our members on July 18.  The
survey was prepared by the GISB Future Technology Task Force as a response to
one of the action items on our 2000 Annual Plan. It was presented to the
Executive Committee at its June meeting and received the endorsement of the
Executive Committee. Please let me know if you have concerns with this
document, or if you have any changes to it.  If you have difficulty
retrieving this document, please call the GISB office at (713) 356-0060.

Best Regards,  Rae
