Phil:

As you requested on last week's conference call, attached is a draft position 
on pipeline safety legislation.  The draft includes background and positions 
on both re-authorization legislation (on which there has been a great deal of 
activity lately) and appropriations legislation.

Once you and the Task Force have had the opportunity to review this material, 
it can be used to brief Stan Horton and Bob Hill in advance of the INGAA 
Board meeting this coming Thursday in Calgary.
