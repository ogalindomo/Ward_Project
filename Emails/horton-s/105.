Subject: Environmental Training for Phase IV

In preparation for the start of construction, key employees for the 
contractor and the inspection staff have received training at off site third 
party locations.

The attached list indicates 25 project Inspectors and 7 contractor 
employees.  I propose that we send this list to FDEP.
