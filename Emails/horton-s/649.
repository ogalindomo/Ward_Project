Almost done with your drafts.  Took me a little longer to review and revise
Adam's first drafts than I had thought (there's a lot going on here, as
you'll see soon).

I expect to send them out to you sometime tomorrow. Since Debbie is a client
too, I think I'll just mail them to your home unless you prefer otherwise.
