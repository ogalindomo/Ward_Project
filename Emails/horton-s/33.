This morning, Cutty informed Bill Thacker that Cutty was leaving TEPPCO to 
join
EOTT on Feb 2, 2000.  Reportedly Bill was stunned and not very happy about
Cutty's leaving.  Thacker asked that we wait until tomorrow to announce this
development as he is "trying to determine what to tell TEPPCO troops."

Mary Ellen will you prepare an announcement for me to send out tomorrow that
announces:
1.  The hiring of Cutty
2.   The new role of Operations Governance
3.  The reporting  relationships of the District managers
4.  The leaving of AL Hugh
5.  The combination of the South Texas and West Tex/ New Mexico regions
6.  The new roles of John Oveson and Robin Border

thanks, mike
