Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much
