All:

This is to inform you that the as of today 02/26/01 the Gas group will be 
officializing a new book, NG-PR-OPT-PRC.  This book will capture the Options 
portion of the NG-PRICE-PRC.  Over the weekend the Option deals were 
tranfered to the new book and test Calc without problems.  For anyone 
manually pulling in data related to the NG-PRICE-PRC or NG-PRICE2-PRC you 
should adjust your procedures to insure that need data is captured from ERMS 
system using the new book and no duplicate data is captured.  On the ERMS 
system the book id is NG-PR-OPT.  


Errol:  To insure that credit does not capture old data related to the 
RisktRAC bookID NG-PRICE2-PRC can you please calc that book to zero for one 
last time.  You should use the same procedures previously used to isolate the 
Options piece from the book.  To insure that  we do not cause problems for 
the Cash Flow group please calc the options piece first and then the swaps.  
This will insure that the Swaps data is properly capture for the IR/FX 
group.  If you have any questions please call me at ext 54751



Regards,


Nancy
