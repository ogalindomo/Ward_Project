Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.
