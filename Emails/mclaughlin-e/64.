Richard,

Due to the release of the Options Manager in EOL, we need a new UOM set up in 
global for MM-L.  This MM-L implies that the options are traded in lots 
online but need to convert to MMBTU for valuation purposes.  Therefore, 1 
MM-L = 10,000 MMBTU.  Can you please let me know if you need further 
information to set up this Global UOM?

Thank you for your help!  Hope you feel better!
