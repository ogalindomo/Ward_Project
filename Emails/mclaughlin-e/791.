Sorry Dawn, QS7544 is not correct.  This deal is an option and is booked to 
NG-Exotic.  It should be booked to NG-PR-OPT.

Thanks,

Errol

Errol, can you look at these deals in tagg stage and let me know if this is 
how they are supposed to look?  These are the deals with the option having 
NG-PR-OPT, but the swap remaining the same as before.  If everything looks ok 
we will put into production this evening.  

Let me know...

QS7544 and QS7545

Dawn
