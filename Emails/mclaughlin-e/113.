The TDS flag and Rolloff % fields in PortCalc are now in production MetaCalc.

Please note that when copying a meta_id, these fields are copied as is, which
is similar to PortCalc's copy post_id behaviour.

Thank you,

Subject: TDS Flag in Meta Calc

What is the estimate on when the TDS flag will be in Meta Calc?

In addition to Gas, Coal will start using TDS next week.
