Subject: Physical Trader Matrix

I am sending the physical trader matrix for another update from risk.  I have 
added a column called 'Sitara Risk Assignment Desk' and populated the cells 
in yellow with what Sitara uses now when assigning hedges.  

Please update the list with the Sitara Risk Assignment Desk and also review 
the cells I populated to ensure accuracy.  

Thank you for all of your help.  Let me know if you have any further 
questions.
