Sorry the last message got jumbled.  Tell Mark to go ahead and archive the 
months mentioned below.  I will look for other files we don't need.

Thanks,

Errol

Subject: ERMS folder

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Thanks
