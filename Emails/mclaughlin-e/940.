Hey Errol,

I was just wondering if you have any information on these deals yet.  I spoke 
to you 
a few weeks ago about them, and you said that you'd get back to me.  We need 
to
have these deals invoiced and cleared up in TAGG before April Liquidations 
are 
run at the end of the month.  Could you please get back to me and let me know
what you know about them.

Thanks for your help
Stacey
