Hello everyone,

Hope you all are doing well.
I believe the Cross Timbers rebooking nitemare has finally come to an end!
All we need to do now is send out the revised confirms.

Accounting:
Below is a list of deal numbers that were either changed, killed, or created.
I believe this is everything.

Please let me know if I seem to be missing any deals or if you have any 
questions.

Best Regards and THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed to this 'project'!
