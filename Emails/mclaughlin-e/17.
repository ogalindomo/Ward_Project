Subject: Deals booked to New Counterparty

The attached file represents deals booked to New Counterparty as of close of 
business, December 8. In order to correctly report and manage credit 
exposure, these deals need to be rebooked to reflect the actual counterparty 
on the transaction.  



 Please forward this to the appropriate person within your organization who 
can rebook the deals to the proper counterparty, or call me at X35856 if you 
have questions.

Thanks,

Debbie
