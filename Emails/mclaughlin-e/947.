Hey Errol,

I was just wondering if you could please get back to me about those two deals
that I've been trying to get some information on from you.  May Nymex is 
being 
invoiced today, April liquidations are being run either on Monday or Tuesday
next week, and I need to know how I'm supposed to invoice for QX0898 and 
QX0899.

It is very important that this gets figured out as soon as possible as the 
customer
is wanting to settle these deals, and we have nothing to show for it right 
now.

Please let me know what you come up with.

Thanks
Stacey
