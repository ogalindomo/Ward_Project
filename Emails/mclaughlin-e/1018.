We have completed a audit of the current user access rights for the O:\EOL 
directory.  In our analysis we have determined that there are authorized 
users who no longer need access to this directory. 

In order to better maintain the EOL directory we will be removing your access 
to the directory.  If there are business needs that require continued access, 
please call Jennifer Denny at 3-5824.

Thank you for your cooperation.
