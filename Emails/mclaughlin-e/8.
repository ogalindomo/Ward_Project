There is a 30 minute meeting every morning on the 28th floor at 8:30 about 
systems issues from the prior night and to discuss what books were not 
officialized.  I have gone to this meeting this week, and I think that we 
should always have a representative in the meeting.  Here is what I propose:  
We alternate weeks going to this meeting.

Week of :
Dec. 4   - Jeff Gossett
Dec. 11 - Darron Giron
Dec. 18 - David Baumbach
Dec. 25 - Will Kelly
Jan. 1    -  Kam Keiser
Jan. 8    - Errol Mclaughlin

And then we will start over again.
If you can not go,  make sure that someone goes in your place.

Thanks

Irena and Elizabeth -  Can you please add these daily meetings to the 
appropriate calender?

Thanks
