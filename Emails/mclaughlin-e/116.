Kori,

Please make all adjustments that are needed for the Prepay books, in the 
January DPR.  These variances are causing a problem for Faith Killen's flash 
to actual process and Arthur Anderson has been questioning the variance from 
the total value in Schedule B versus the controls group schedule. AA loves to 
dissect the prepay books!

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks!
