Errol -

Here is Alroy's number.  I would call him as soon as possible.  Let me know 
what the verdict is and when you talk to him.

Thanks

Jeff,

I'm pretty sure that Errol hasn't talked with Alroy yet.  You can contact him 
on the tie line @ 7830 - 35568.  I know he is very interested in a spot in 
Houston, so any help you can give we would both appreciate!

Dave
