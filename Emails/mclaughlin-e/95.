We have a new version of the TAGG-Deal Capture Application in TAGG's staging 
area ready for user testing. The reason for the new version is to incorporate 
three new requests. The new requests are as follows:

Provide ability to capture external exchange deal numbers and associate them 
with a TAGG deal.
For TAGG deals that have more than 9 legs,  redo numbering such that leg 
numbers on Deal Structure Screen match  with leg numbers in Deal Capture 
Detail screen and  forwards 
detail report .
For physical NG deals, require  a link to a Sitara deal num before allowing 
deal to save in TAGG.

The attached document contains more information regarding the external 
exchange item mentioned above.


The current plan is to migrate these changes into  production the evening of 
Monday January 22, 2001. If you have any problems with the changes made to 
this version of Deal Capture Application or with 
the proposed migration plans, please contact Oscar Rivera(x5-3361) or Sanjeev 
Gupta (x5-3816) as soon as possible.

thanks,

Oscar Rivera
