Subject: OA variance as of Feb 28 GL

All,

The OA variance as of 2/28 GL is $80.0 MM.  Jim Little is preparing the 
region by production month schedule and this will be available by tomorrow.  
I would like to get with you tomorrow afternoon to go over our strategy as 
quarter-end and the AA audit are close at hand.  Let me know if 1:00 tomorrow 
will work for you.  Thanks.
