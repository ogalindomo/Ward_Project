Subject: Officializing Risk Books

Irena - Please forward to all in Risk Management:



In the last few weeks there have been numerous occasions in which certain 
risk books have not been officialized.  Most of these instances have been due 
to oversight; one instance was at the direction of Commercial.

I want to re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that all risk books are 
officialized at the end of the day.  This is the only mechanism we have to 
ensure that all trading positions are included in the Daily Position Report 
and daily trading limit calculations, both of which are reviewed by top Enron 
management on a daily basis.  This must be a top priority for Risk Management 
and we need to do whatever we have to do to make sure we remember to perform 
this function at the end of every day.  Furthermore, it is totally 
unacceptable for Commercial to direct any book administrator to not 
officialize a risk book.  If this occurs again and you are uncomfortable with 
dealing with the situation, please inform your Desk Controller, Steve Jackson 
or myself immediately and we will address the issue.

I realise every one of you has a lot on your plate and are working 
significant hours to get your jobs done.  However, let's do what we have to 
do to make sure that this basic responsibility of Risk Management is 
performed every day without any exceptions.

Brent
