Subject: Change to ENA/EES Deals

Can the following deals be rebooked using the current intercompany 
methodology:

 Buyer = Enron Energy Services
 Seller = Enron North America (or RMT if these are all financial)

Then what is now the counterparties on the deal will become the books. 

These are the only deals that are left that are booked the old way.  I was  
hoping to make things consistent.  Two of the deals (EH1958.1, EH4242.5) will 
roll off the end of May -the others have months to go.

Thanks for the help
