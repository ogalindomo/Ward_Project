Dave,

One more time on the skew test. 
Please run the calcs tonight for the ngpropt book along with the calls and 
puts calcs.
Use the last skew table that you got from John Griffith.
If everything looks good then we will move everything into production.

Errol,

Please provide Dave the Post ID for the ngpropt book for the COB 3-29-01
