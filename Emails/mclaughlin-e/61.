We pushed some option deals through the test environment.  Could you please 
look at the following deals in Tagg Stage.   

132456 underlying swap
132455 call option  I know the volumes on the swap look outragous on these 
swaps, but that is fixed now.
132458 underlying swap
132457 put option

132922 call option
132924 call option

I am attaching the transaction summary for your review.  Call me with any 
questions or if you need to know the option criteria.
