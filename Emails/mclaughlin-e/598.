I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told 
Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like 
Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.

I don't thing that is an option.  If we give you the ability to change names 
then you also have the ability to change other parts of the deals.

Subject: Credit Report

In order for our credit exposure to be recorded correctly, our group 
(Financial Confirmations) would like to be able to change c/p names for all 
desks going forward.  One person will be designated to handle all changes and 
an email will be sent regarding these changes daily.  Please let me know how 
you feel about this?

Thanks for your time,

Bianca
