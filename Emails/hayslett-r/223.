Attached is a PBA nomination for your approval.  This one is for Bobbie 
LaChapelle who has basically molded and created this new data analyst 
position within the department.   She has blazed the trail for others to 
follow and transition into a higher level of employee.   Her work is helping 
us in attempting to identify and correct more measurement data as it comes in 
from the Field RTUs.   This effort goes a long way in enhancing customer 
service levels and is especially value added work.
