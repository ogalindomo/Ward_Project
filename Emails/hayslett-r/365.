Attached is a calculation of your "Total Capital" deployed, building from 
equity, for the years 2000 and 2001.
Rick Causey has asked me to present  this "Total Capital" broken down between 
the following categories:
  
  Strategic Pipelines 
  Strategic Power Plants
  Strategic Communications
  Strategic Other (Subdivide as you like) 
  Merchant
  
Not included in the attached numbers are off balance sheet items. Please give 
a summary of any off balance sheet
items.

The capital presented is estimated from the plans recently submitted. I am 
not looking for total precision, just good
estimates. I need this information early next week. It will be used in a 
board presentation.
  
     

Thanks for your help,
