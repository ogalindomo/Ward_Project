Thanks for the "heads-up", Julie!   Stan would like for both Danny and Rod to 
send subs to our staff meeting on January 8th, and please let me know who 
they will be.

Thanks,
Cindy

Cindy:

Please note that I just received information from Cindy Olson on the Year-End 
2000 VP and MD PRC meeting.  It is scheduled for Monday, January 8th and 
Danny is required to attend as he serves on that committee.  Danny would not 
be able to attend Stan's staff meeting.  Thanks.
