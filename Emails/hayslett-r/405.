To all,

This is just a reminder that we need PEP forms and ratings on those 
associates under your charge that will be represented by Mark Russ.  
Wednesday, December 13 is the day that the Associates will be evaluated and 
rated on a Corporate level.  We would encourage you to submit this 
information to either Mark Russ or myself by  Friday, December 9th.  


Brad Richter:  Mo Bawa, Billy Braddock, John Choi, 

Richard Leibert:  Mark Dypiangco

Rod Hayslett:  Michael Ratner

Sheila Kahanek:  Nikhil Shah


Thank you for your prompt attention to this very important matter.
