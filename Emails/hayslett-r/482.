FYI
Attached is a a current worksheet of the ETS accounting organization. (Sorry, 
I haven't been able to prepare an org. chart yet). This still reflects Clean 
Fuels as dotted line; but we could easily "plug" Kerry and his organization 
into the structure in any one of a number of areas, but most likley would be 
with Jennifer Lev in consolidations. I would like to have nonregulated 
entities kept separate from interestate pipelines -as possible.
