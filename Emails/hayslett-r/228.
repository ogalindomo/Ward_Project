The attached model has the RAROC and COS model in the various spreadsheet.  
The rates I gave on the matrix and the COS rate track for the 500 MMBTU/d 
expansion at the $613,500M unleveraged.  We would experience negative 
depreciation for the first five years of the project.  Under the 70/30 debt 
equity scenario we would have a rate about $.58 and that tracks with the DCF 
model, and we would have escalating depreciation rates over the term of the 
project.
