We need a decision from the Business Units regarding the recommended (or 
standard) reporting / analysis tool for ENRON's SAP Data Warehouse.  This 
decision will be made by consensus (or at least by a majority of the Business 
Units).

We need both the correct Business and IT decision-makers to attend this 
meeting.  If you are not one of these people, please forward this invitation 
to the correct individuals in your Business Unit and ensure that they attend.

This meeting will take place on Thursday, June 8th from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. in 
Conference Room EB46C1.

We have arranged to have both the BRIO and Business Objects vendors conduct 
demonstrations of their end-user reporting and analysis tools, plus their IT 
development tools.

Following the meeting, each attendee will be asked for their recommendation 
on the "corporate standard" package.  NOTE:  Individual Business Units can 
select (and purchase) the reporting/analysis tool of their choice, if it 
differs from the standard selected.

Please RSVP on this invitation so we know how many attendees to expect.  
Also, let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you, Pat Cagney
