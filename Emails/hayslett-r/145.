Jeff Brockman will be in town 8/7 -8/9, but due to our group's size and room 
availability, 
we booked a 1:00-4:00 p.m. meeting. He will discuss what Enron Broadband 
Services has done with Acta 
Extractions and the BRIO products.  (Separately, I will be scheduling a BRIO 
demo to cover the  functionality 
of each level of the Reporting and Querying tool).
