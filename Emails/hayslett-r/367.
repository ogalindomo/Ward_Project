Greetings!

Due to overwhelming demand, we've added new functionality to our "Improve
Your Boss" assessment results.  In addition to your original grades (by
category), you can now see how you did on a QUESTION-BY-QUESTION basis.

We are providing this enhanced reporting free of charge.  To see this new
information, just login at:
http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/IYBoss/BossResults/

Your login is: rhaysle@enron.com
Your password is: 84ot8g

We hope you find this more detailed information beneficial.  Please let us
know if you have other suggestions to make this tool more useful to you.

If you should care to repeat the assessment process, you should be aware
that we are now charging "top-down" users $9.95 for each employee you invite
to participate:

In keeping with our vision, however, new assessments initiated "bottom-up"
by individual employees are still free.

On a final note, we are also undertaking a limited number of custom
development projects.  If you're interested in a customized employee opinion
survey, retention survey, or 360-degree feedback tool, please visit our site
and complete this short online inquiry form:

Thank you.
