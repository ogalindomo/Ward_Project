Beginning on Friday, we will meet in 49C2 immediately after the GPG staff 
meeting.  We will work on the many issues and items needed to complete the 
Definitive Agreement docs on the PetroNet deal.  Optional invitees are 
requested to send a delegate to participate to the extent necessary.  This 
project has a high GPG priority and your cooperation would be appreciated.
