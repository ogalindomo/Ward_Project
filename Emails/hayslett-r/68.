I have attached two additional files that I hope you will find useful in 
completing your effort.

 This document contains definitions for terms commonly used in this project.  
It is provided so all the data gathered reflects that same understanding of 
what was being asked for.  Please refer to page three for data gathering 
worksheet definitions.   NOTE: The specific definition for STRATEGIC - the 
last column of the worksheet - is still being developed.  This should not, 
however, interfere with or hold up your work effort.


This is an early draft of the Gas Control Activity/Task worksheet.  I have 
added columns that incorporate all the requested data items.

Subject: Project Why

Pursuant to Phase 1 of Project Why, I have attached a draft of the process 
assessments for ET&S Market Services for the Scheduling, Electronic Business 
Development, Gas Control, Invoicing/Accounting, and Contracts functions. Our 
next step will be to complete the additional columns. Call with questions.

Thanks. Julia
