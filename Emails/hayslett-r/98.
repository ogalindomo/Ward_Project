Hi Rod

It was great to hear from you last Friday.  Thanks for
keeping me in mind.

I have attached a Word document of my resume which I
briefly updated over the weekend.

It looks like I would be available to go to Houston
anywhere between Friday June 9th and Thursday June
22nd.

Let me know if this timeframe works for you.

Best regards

Mike
