Rod, your request for headcount numbers was forwarded to me from Wilson.  As 
of 11/06/2000 the total headcount for ETS is 2647.
This total includes all active, regular full time hourly/salary employees.  
The total number of employees increases to 2663 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.

The total number of Houston based employees is 607.  This number includes all 
active, regular full time hourly/salary employees whose work city is 
"Houston".  This includes 1400 Smith, 333 Clay, 2900 N. Loop and 15229 
Kuykendahl.    This number increases to 613 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

If considering Pasadena as part of "Houston", totals increase to 660 for 
regular full time hourly/salary employees;  666 including regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

Clean Fuels and the newly transferred EOTT employees are included in all of 
the above totals.  If you need additional information or a more detailed 
breakout based on different criteria, you may call me at 3,4878.

Thanks.
