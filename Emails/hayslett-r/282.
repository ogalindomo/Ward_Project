I have attached the resume of a good friend of mine who is starting to look 
for a job.  For the last year or so he has been running his own company, but 
prior to that he has worked in the energy business, primarily in power.  He 
is trying to get a better sense of Enron, better than I could tell him, and I 
thought you would be a good person for him to speak with.  Please let me know 
if you would be willing to meet with him and I can make the arrangements.

Thanks,

Michael
