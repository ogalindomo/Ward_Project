Rod,

It was a pleasure to meet you at the Birthday Party for Wendy Cherubini on
Friday, November 17th at the Woodlands Athletic Center. I found our
conversation to be enjoyable and informative.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how Thompson
Consulting my be of service to Enron. We offer a broad range of professional
services that I am sure Enron would find of value.

Please let me know when would be best for us to meet and I would try to
accommodate your requirement. If there are others you feel should join us in
the meeting please feel free to invite them and let me know.
