Rod, here is my input on the 2000 Goals and Objectives. My numbering will 
correspond to the list of goals and objectives which accompanied your e-mail. 
    1. Completed. Final certificate was gotten in Feb. 2000 and the west leg 
construction was completed and in service around 10/1.
    2. Partially completed. PD received on Phase 5 on 11/21 but the EIS is 
not expected til 1/01.
    3. No input.
    4. No input.
    5. Completed.
    6. As you know, CitrusNet was not completed. We have developed a good 
structure for the transaction being considered a sale and we have developed 
the necessary contract documents to accomplish the deal but at present we 
have no takers.
    7. No comments.
    8. I think this was intended to be the MOPS sale which I believe has been 
moved to next year.
    9. No comment.
    10. Efforts were made with a couple of potential buyers to work out a 
deal but nothing definitive was accomplished.
    11. A lot of work was done in connection with Project Cristobal but 
nothing was finalized with potential partners.
