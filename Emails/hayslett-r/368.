Rod--

I am leaving for Panama on Monday, will return on the 12th, and then leave 
for vacation on the 13th.  I plan to be back in Houston for good on December 
29th, but will also come in on the 12th after my flight arrives from Panama.  
If I need to be reached, you can contact my parents in Dallas at 972-255-6308.

If I don't see you on the 12th, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Christine
