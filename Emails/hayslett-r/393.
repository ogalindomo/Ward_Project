Certainly some of the goals and objectives from me and my group will be:

1.     Support and participation in meeting or exceeding operating company 
goals for UAF figures.  (note these have not been finalized yet so no numbers 
are in place)

2.     Support of project work and successful implementation of the new 
measurement system (PGAS)

3.     Continued support in the finalization or any ongoing projects involved 
with Gas Measurement Continuous Improvement

4.     Maintain or improve accuracy rates for GMS data to the Operating 
Companies from the current levels of 99% on station accuracy and 98% on total 
gross MMBtu processed.
