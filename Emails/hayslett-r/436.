I proposed that we allocate residual costs using a documented ETS "modified 
Massachusetts formula"
I think Tracy was "ok" with that approach.  
Rod?

Jim - Has there been any determination on spreading the SAP costs to the 
BUs?  We need to load the 2001 plan into SAP soon.

How do you want to allocate to the BUs the SAP costs that Company 0366 
receives from Corp?
