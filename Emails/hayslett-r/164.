Susan Bellinghausen and Pat Cagney would like to meet with each of you to 
discuss the GPG SAP Reporting needs.  Based on discussions at the ASE, 
"Project Jumpstart" is being initiated to develop a plan for addressing the 
reporting needs of GPG. Please plan to attend this meeting to learn what 
support is being offered and to provide your input into what you need from 
the reporting team.  EB 30C2 is a video conference room.  We are trying to 
get a video conference room in Omaha also.  We will let you know on Tuesday 
where the Omaha meeting room will be.
