Subject: Brian Schroeder - New Arrival


Maggie and Walt Schroeder, together with big sister Claire,
take pleasure in announcing the birth of Brian Christopher on
June 15, 2000, at 2:02 PM.  He weighed in at 5 lbs. 14 oz.
and was 18
 inches long.  Mom and Dad are still in a state
of shock, and have already forgotten what a good night of
sleep is.  Claire is acting like a two year old and has claimed
Brian as MINE! MINE! MINE!
