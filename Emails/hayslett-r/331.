We invite you to read the first newsletter issued by the C.T. BAUER COLLEGE

investment of $40 million made by Mr. Ted Bauer, Chairman and Co-Founder of

AIM Management Group, in the College that now bears his name. Please take

the time to read about the greatest event in the history of the College of

Business!
