Gentlemen,
Please find attached two excel CAPM models which use Crystal Ball, an Excel 
add-in, to perform Monte Carlo simulations. The first tab in each workbook 
have details, however, if you have any questions please call me @ x39946.  I 
am hoping that you can validate and/or offer suggestions on refining the 
model and it's assumptions. 

Thank you in advance,

RS
