Rod,

I mentioned that I have been working on eStrategy.  I thought I would share 
with you my contributions.  The Word doc is a template that is partially 
filled in with my ideas (in blue).  Slides 6-8 are my attempt to condense my 
ideas into a couple of diagrams and e-Strategy statement.  I have worked 
primarily with Mike Sullivan on this but several others have played a 
reviewer role so far.  Of course, this is very preliminary but I thought you 
may find it interesting as you have always enjoyed technology.
