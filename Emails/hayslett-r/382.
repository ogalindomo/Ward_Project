To all,

Mark Russ is representing one or more associate under your supervision.  We 
need as soon as possible,  your prepared feedback and evaluation on each 
associate you supervise.  

You may e-mail or send via interoffice mail this information to either Mark 
or myself.

Thanks for your prompt attention to this important matter.
