Please let me know if you can make a meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 19, at 10 am to 
discuss the potential LNG project in the Bahamas, the associated pipeline to 
Florida and the possible Florida power plant.  There may also be some revenue 
generating assets on the Bahamas side.  I will let you know the room number 
once I secure one.  For those who are not located in Houston, please let me 
know if you are available by phone.

Thank you,

Michael
