hi, all.

right now, i am in peru.  everything is great,now that
we have left lima.  beth and i have been in cusco for
the past 3 days.  so far we have taken a tour of the
cities major sites (cathedrals and temples), rode
horses around the countryside, and toured the sacred
valley (inca citadel ruins).  this country is more
beautiful than i could have imagined.  the andes are
something.

tommorrow, we leave for a 4 day 3 night trek on the
inca trail to macchu pichu.  the more people i speak
to the more excited i get.  here is to the city in the
clouds, trail mix and 4 days of not showering.
