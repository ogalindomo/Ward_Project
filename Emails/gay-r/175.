I just spoke to Mike Banks at Milbank who said payment has not yet been
received re: their invoice.  He has had some conversations with Robert
Novak and others at Enron and undertands that payment has been approved
but for some reason not yet made.  I would appreciate if you could look
into this to see what the status is.

Mike understands that we are in a holding pattern on the permanent
financing until the changes in the project are completed.

Regards
Bill
