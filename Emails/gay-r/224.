In order to provide more stability to the Unify Gas application, we'd like to 
start performing morning reboots of the database system starting at 6:30 AM.  
Please run this by your groups to see if it's okay with them.

This is a short term precaution until Sybase fixes the new bug we have 
identified (i.e. server hanging, people can't get work done which results in 
hour glasses).  The reboot should take approimately 25 minutes, which 
includes a prime script which caches a lot of the more frequently used data 
for better performance.

I'll give you a date it will start unless I hear there is some reason we 
can't do this.

If you have questions, please ask.

Thanks
