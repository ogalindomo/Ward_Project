As far as I know only the Hermes fee is refundable (less a small, unknown 
admin cost).  We may also have some fees payable, we will have to check.

Rob,
could you please tell me, in case of non funding, how much EPE/GASMAT/GABOL 
will receive back from OPIC and KfW related to the par-paid costs like, 
commitment fees, Hermes fee,etc.
