Hello everyone.

 You will be receiving a report that contains a list of all of your direct 
reports via inter company mail.  Please take a moment to review your list to 
ensure that we have included everyone for PRC purposes.  In the event that 
you need to make changes, please do so on the report itself and return it to 
my assistant, Ramona Perkins at EB 3659B, by May 30, 2001.  You may also 
contact Ramona directly at ext. 5-8165 to make any updates via telephone.  If 
you do choose to call her, please go ahead and forward your updated report 
back to her.    
 
 Thank you.
