		 Subject: Contract for California Consultants

I received a call from Sam Wehn, who is in our California office.  He needs a 
consulting contract written up for Gene Tackett, who provides public and 
government affairs support to our California development activities.  Who 
would handle writing up such a contract?  Please advise.

Eric
