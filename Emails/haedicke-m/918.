Janette:

Please make contact with the gem broker below and set a time where I can meet 
him and look at some topaz, emeralds and opals.  I want to look at loose 
stones.  I may need to talk to him before I go.

Got your voice message.  The guy with the gems in Sao Paulo is Gerson de 
Castro Mendes.  His phone number is 5511 5071 6660 (His English is excellent, 
so you can leave a message.)  His email address is: gemart@cepa.com.br 

Pat will let Gerson know that you will be contacting him directly.  Good luck.

Regards,
Randy
