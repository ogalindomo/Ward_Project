I just wanted to drop you a short note to let you know that Kevin 
McConville's deposition today in the Berry Construction case went off without 
a hitch.  Outside counsel reports that the deposition was really a 
non-event.  It lasted only three hours, and opposing counsel was not terribly 
effective.  McConville reportedly did an excellent job of sticking to the 
party line, and there were no damning admissions.
