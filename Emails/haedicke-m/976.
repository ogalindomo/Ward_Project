Mark,

Attached for Mark Frevert's upcoming trip to Dubai, please find a copy of one 
of the various DPC LNG Contract summaries that I prepared some time ago at 
the request of Rob Walls.  The summary is designed to feature DPC's 
take-or-pay exposures and various contractual and practical risk mitigants.  
I thought this would be much more user-friendly for Mark Frevert than the 
more detailed contract matrices that we also worked on, but would be happy to 
provide the detailed matrices as well if you think it would be of benefit.

Kind regards,
Dan
