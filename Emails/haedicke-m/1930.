Mark,

Attached is some cusory information and related news article on insurance 
coverage currently being touted in the market  for IP risks.  Coverage is 
avaialable for both offensive (enforcement) and defensive actions.

If you're interested in exploring specific applications for Enron Networks, 
I'm happy to arrange a meeting with the underwriter.  Jsut let me know.

Thanks,
