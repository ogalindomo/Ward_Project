In connection with the risk memorandum already provided you as to the Energy 
Marketing Services Agreement (EMSA) between EPMI and TECO's Frontera 
Generation Limited Partnership, Stuart Zisman asked me to forward you the 
current draft of a risk memorandum relating to the Qualified Scheduling 
Entity ("QSE") services relationships that EPMI would enter with third 
parties in the ERCOT Region.  Per my voicemail to you, attached is such draft 
risk memorandum.      

1.  Risk memorandum addressing the downstream (EPMI - Customer) contract, 
relevant to the TECO transaction:
                

Also per my voicemail, I am making available other materials bearing on ERCOT 
market context and the contractual position EPMI would occupy in offering QSE 
Services, including a draft risk memorandum treating EPMI's contractual 
relationship to be put in place with the ERCOT ISO, and relevant background 
materials referenced by the two risk memoranda.  Please contact me with any 
questions.  - David
