Dear General Counsels:

For Your Attention

With the launch of our legal portal - Enron Legal Edge 
http://legaledge.corp.enon.com, all our legal people now can easily access 
corporate records, research tools, core legal publications and many other 
business tools needed to perform our work from the portal anytime anywhere 
around the world.  I would like to take this opportunity to discontinue paper 
susbscriptions of many titles that are now available on the internet and on 
Lexis and Westlaw services.  I'll weed the following titles and make office 
space for Corporate Secretary's staff.  If you are interested in keeping any 
of the books in your office, let me know by Friday, 5/18.  I will have the 
books boxed and shipped to you. Your office then will be reponsible for 
renewal and update with your budget.  Any books not claimed by Friday will be 
donated to the public library or discarded.    

Discontinued Titles -  

US Code Congressional and Administrative News
