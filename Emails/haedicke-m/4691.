Mark,

My nephew is currently attending  his first year of law school. He is looking 
for some summer employment  opportunities within law firms or corporates.  
Does Enron's legal group  hire any summer interns? If so who could I send his 
resume to for consideration? If there is any other guidance I could give to 
him I would be appreciative. thanks 
Jeff
