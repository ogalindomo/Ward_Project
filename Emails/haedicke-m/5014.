I accept and look forward to starting June 1ish.   I would be delighted to 
join you for lunch.  I am playing golf on Thursday and that may cover the 
noon hour, so Friday might be better.  My plane leaves on Friday at 2:50 so 
will need to plan around that.

I wanted to confirm that we have extended you an offer of employment in the 
ENA Legal Department (a part of the Enron  Wholesale Services Legal 
Department) in Portland, Oregon in the Power Assets/ Origination Group 
commencing early June, 2001.  You would be joining us with your existing 
title and at your existing compensation.  Please let me know your response to 
this offer by May 1, 2001.

On a lighter note, we all hope to see you at the Law Conference and would be 
delighted if you could join us for lunch either Thursday or Friday.  Please 
let me know your plans.
