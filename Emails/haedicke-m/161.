Ken:  Just heard that the House Agriculture Subcommittee plans oversight 
hearings on the President's Working Group Report on February 8 and 9 with the 
first day hearing from the Administration and the second day hearing from 
industry.   However, the Hill does not expect to be asked to introduce the 
Administration's legislation by request until March, and, to date, they have 
seen nothing other than the Report .....although the CFTC has indicated that 
release of their position on CEA reform is imminent.

I am contacting the head of PG&E's D.C. office to ask them to join the group 
and will keep you posted of their interest.
