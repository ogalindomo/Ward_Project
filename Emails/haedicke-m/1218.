You need to suggest at least 5 reviewers, but no more than 7 to provide 
feedback on your performance in the PEP system.  The PEP system closes on May 
25, 2001 and all feedback must be completed on or before that date.  

Please logon the PEP system to select your reviewers now.  This will give 
your reviewers ample time to provide feedback on you.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at extension 57803.
