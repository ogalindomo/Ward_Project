Mark--As we discussed this morning, I am attaching a legal risk memo for the 
Fountain Valley Power development.  This memo addresses changes in legal 
risks which have occurred since the Nov. 1 DASh on initial project costs, 
including an amendment to the PPA which we just finalized half an hour ago.  
Please call if you have questions.
