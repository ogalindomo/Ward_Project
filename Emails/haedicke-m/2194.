Attached for your consideration is a memo drafted by a partner in the Lopez 
Velarde firm concerning the status of the prior Amparo proceedings that were 
virtually identical to the proceeding in which Enron Energia Industrial is an 
interested party.  Also attached is a chart describing all six of the 
proceedings and the status of each.

I have heard nothing concerning what actions are being taken to obtain an 
opinion from US counsel concerning the risks, if any, to Enron in providing 
an indemnity to the Inter-American Development Bank ("IDB") relative to this 
litigation.  If we are to enable the provide a proposal to the IDB within the 
next day, the scheduled closing date of November 16, 2000, is in extreme 
jeopardy.  Please advise of the status of the opinion.

Thank you.
