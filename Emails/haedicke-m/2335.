As I said in our conversation in New York, these will be more for trading
practices standardization. It just happens that disputes arise when confirms
are made.

I will see to it that our minutes are sent to you so that you may have
something to learn from us in relation to the Japanese practice issues.

Your minutes in turn will ensure that our efforts do not go astray from the
global standard.

Thanks in advance.
