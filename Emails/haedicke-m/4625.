 If you are aware of any reason why an arbitration demand should not be filed 
against any of these entities, please call me or e-mail me by the end of 
business on Monday March 5, 2001.  If I don't hear from you by then, I will 
assume that you have no objection to moving forward against these companies.

 Thanks in advance.
