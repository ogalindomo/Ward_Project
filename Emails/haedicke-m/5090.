Dear Mr Mark E  Haedicke,

It isn't too late to list your company in the 2001 UTILICON business 
directory!

As you are all aware we have recently changed the format of the UTILICON 
Portal, and as a result we have been calling for updated directory listings.  
The old Power directory is being expanded to include details of gas, water 
and telecom industry participants and suppliers!

So, if you already had a listing, this is an ideal opportunity for you to 
update all your contact details and company information to be included in the 
new edition of UTILICON.com.au's searchable online business directory!

If your company has not previously been listed, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE to 
increase your profile! UTILICON.com.au is the biggest regional portal for 
utilities, utility suppliers and customers, so you cannot afford not to take 
advantage of this great marketing opportunity!

All you need to do is email us for a directory listing sheet, simply complete 
all the company information and email it back to us by the 30 June 2001. To 
receive your directory listing information sheet contact us today!

For FREE Standard Listings: mailto:utilicon@terrapinn.com

OR STAND OUT IN THE CROWD!  For $500/$750 have your company logo and a 
description of your companies products and services listed on the directory.
