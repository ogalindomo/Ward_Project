Jeff, Bill,

Per your request, attached is a spreadsheet which details counterparty 
exposure in the West region.  The spreadsheet contains several tabs which 
detail each the Physical MTM and Financial MTM exposure.  Please be sure you 
are looking at the correct spreadsheets.  Also, these exposure amounts do not 
reflect the overall exposure with each counterparty, just the exposure for 
the West region.

Thanks
Russell
