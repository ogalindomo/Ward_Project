We have been working on structures much like this with the "Muni Initiative" 
that  Amanda  Martin started with Mike McDonald and Sandra McDonald.  The 
problem is finding a muni that is not currently a utility and a utility with 
out of the money QF contracts that is willing to sell them that also has the 
distribution system to serve the muni.  There is not much of a role for us in 
these deals in any event.
