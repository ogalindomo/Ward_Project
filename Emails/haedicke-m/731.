		 Subject: Update Legal, Credit and BAckoffice Status - Enron de Mexico

First of all, thank you very much for this last push. The list of pending 
issues with the Mexican counterparties has really come down in the last two 
weeks, and we really appreciate your efforts down here...You will find the 
status report on this file, which still needs some work to be done, but I 
believe now the ball is more on our customer's court than ours...Thanks again 
and we appreciate your continuing support. 

Kind regards.
