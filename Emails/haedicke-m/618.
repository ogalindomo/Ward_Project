		 Subject: Legal Status Report

Attached are blacklined and clean copies of the Legal Status Report for Enron 
Canada.  This Legal Status Report is intended to update each of you and may 
include matters of interest to some, but not all of you.  By copy of this 
e-mail to Kay, I ask that she pull from this list whatever she needs for the 
Legal Finance/Transactions Group Status Report.

Regards,
Peter
