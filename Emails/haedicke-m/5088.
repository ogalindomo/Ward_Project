Attached is a draft of the declaratory judgment action prepared by Baker 
Botts, our outside counsel on this matter.  A conscious effort has been made 
for the petition to be short and sweet.  However, we need to make sure the 
underlying facts and the history of the transaction are described properly.  

Please take a few moments to review this draft and forward me any comments by 
e-mail or fax (713-646-3490).

Thanks.
