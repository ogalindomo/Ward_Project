 The Sempra termination notices we discussed yesterday were sent out, by 
certified mail, last night.  Courtesy copies were faxed this morning.  We 
haven't received any response yet.
 Thank you all for your attention to this.  Please call if you would like 
copies of the termination letters or if you have any questions.
