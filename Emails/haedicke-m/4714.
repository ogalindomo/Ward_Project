The Pastoria DASH each of you signed last week has been modified at the 
request of Jeff Skilling and Rebecca Carter.  Late Friday afternoon, West 
Power was advised to value the gas transportation on a PV10 rather than VaR 
basis.  The impact of this change was to increase the cost of the gas 
transportation from $34MM to $102.3MM.  The $102.3MM is a worst-case scenario 
in that it assumes none of the capacity can be resold.

Also, RAC has advised that no new signatures will be required for the revised 
DASH.  

The revised DASH will be considered by the Enron Executive Committee this 
afternoon in a special meeting along with other projects.

Attached for you convenience are (1) the original DASH (DASH dev final 
dg.doc), (2) the final DASH before the Executive Committee 
(DASH_Pastoria4_030901) and (3) a redlined comparision of the final to the 
original (DASH_Pastoria4_0309091_redlined).  Most all highlighted changes 
reflect the substitution PV for VaR.  A few minor changes were also made.
