The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled an oral argument on Monday 
12:00 CST on our request for a stay of the district court's order granting 
the Universities' motion for a preliminary injunction.  The argument will be 
by telephone, and will be heard by a three-judge panel.  Mike Smith, Dennis 
Benevides, and I will be with counsel during the argument.  Please contact me 
with any questions (ext. 646-6412; cell 281-414-0364).
