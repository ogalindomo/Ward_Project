Attached is a power point presentation that the ag group prepared for our 
meeting with Sidley & Austin in Chicago yesterday.  FYI, I think the meeting 
went well -- S&A had some helpful comments about some of the prototypes we 
are considering and I think our commercial people value their ag knowledge.
