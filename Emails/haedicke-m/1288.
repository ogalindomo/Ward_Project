dear mark,

susan bulgazicz gave me your name as a starting point. regarding the sale of 
east coast power to elpaso.

elpaso purchased east coast power early in the year.  east coast power has 
126 boxes stored in offsite storage under the enron account number.  elpaso 
in now ready to transfer these containers to their offsite storage account.  
there will be a permanent withdrawal fee per container.  this is my 
question.   according to the terms of the contract,  which company, enron or 
elpaso, is responsible for these costs?

please advise.

thanks,
