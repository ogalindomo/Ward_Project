This decision upholds the FERC order that EPMI (and other marketers) properly 
terminated their prospective transactions with PCA during the summer of 1999 
when PCA defaulted (EPMI was not required to give 60 days notice before 
termination).

(April 17, 2001)


In the attached decision of the D.C. Cir., Power Company of America lost each 
of its various challenges to FERC's decision that the 60-day notice of 
termination regulation did not apply to the sales agreements with PCA that 
marketers unilaterally terminated in the summer of '99.
