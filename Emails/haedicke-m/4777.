Attached is a DRAFT  TBMA/ISDA document comparing S.420 and H.R. 333.
Please note that this is a draft document and should not be circulated to
hill or regulatory staff at this time.  The document compares each of the
relevant sections of the bill and includes comments on the preferred section
where the House and Senate provisions differ.  Please do not hesitate to
contact me or Frank Hampton  if you have any questions.  Many thanks!   --
