		 Subject: Corp Services Authorization Memos

Attached are 3 updated Word forms for requesting new US entities (Corp, LLC, 
LP).  Unless you have access to our automated HotDocs system for requesting 
Secretary of State corporate activities, please use the attached forms (and 
delete data files for older versions).  Although these forms are not as user 
friendly as our HotDocs templates, they have been conformed as nearly as 
possible to the HotDocs forms, and are now as automated as MicroSoft Word 
will allow.  I think you will find these a great improvement over our old 
forms.  Please forward these new forms to anyone in your group who might need 
to create a new domestic entity.

I continue work on HotDocs templates and Word forms for authorization of US 
mergers, acquisitions, name changes, and for similar activities for non-US 
entities, and will make those available to you ASAP.  In the meantime, if you 
have any questions or comments regarding Corp Services forms, please contact 
me via email or call me at Ext 37291.
