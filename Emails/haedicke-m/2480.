Julia & Mark --

FYI.  I am not sure who (if anyone) from your groups would be interested in 
this topic, but I wanted you to know that Bob Frank has arranged a 
presentation on the UETA / UCITA matter.

		 Subject: UETA/UCITA presentation - Thursday 12/14 10 a.m. - Room 4741

Jeff Dodd will be here this Thursday (12/14) from 10 a.m to noon, to discuss 
UETA, ESIGN and UCITA.  Jeff is a nationally recognized expert in these 
areas.  Basically, this is an opportunity to get a free primer and to explore 
how legal developments in these areas may affect your respective areas of 
concern.
Feel free to invite others who may be interested.
 
I have attached a draft agenda prepared by Jeff.
