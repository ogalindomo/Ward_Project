Mark,

Is there a single point of contact on your team focused on bankruptcy claims 
and non-performance under our commercial contracts?  Is there some sort of 
reporting that your teams prepares that could help facilitate our 
understanding of the current claims in our portfolio?

We have had an increase in claims as of late and I am having trouble tracking 
down the current status on each case.  Let me know if you can help.

Thanks,
Bill
