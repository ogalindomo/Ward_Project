The poll of members of the board resulted in the majority stating that they
prefer beginning the HCCPS Board Meetings at 5:00 P.M. instead of 4:00 P.M.

The September meeting will begin at 4:00 P.M. as planned; then beginning in
October the meetings will begin at 5:00 P.M.

Please note this change in your calendars.

Ernest Fruge
President, HCCPS Board
