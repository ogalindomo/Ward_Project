		 Subject: SO2 Derivatives

A Japanese trading firm has a keen interest in the above derivatives. I
would be grateful if you could send me the Master SO2 Allowance Purchase and
Sale Agreement and any other materials you may feel appropriate for novices.
They could be the first Japanese trading firm member of ISDA.
