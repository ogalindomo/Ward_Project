We are considering these gentlemen as potential arbitrators.  Judge Davies is 
a retired judge of the federal district in California.  William Webster, 
formerly federal judge and Director of the CIA, is now a partner with Milbank 
in its Washington office.  Please let me know if you have had any contact 
with Judge Davies or Mr. Webster, and also please describe generally 
Milbank's past and current representation for your operating company.  Thanks 
for your help.
