Attached is a revised report, reflecting the addition of Elba Island risk, 
the abbreviation of the metals vessel cargo risk, and a reordering of the 
risks from most significant to least significant. Please advise if you need 
anything else from Dan or me. Please note that the Elba Island description is 
more detailed this time around to communicate the risks, but could be pared 
down if you wish. Please advise.

Thanks, Alan
