Here is a draft of the risk memo for ESA.  John and I are still pinning down 
a few items and seeking to update some of the numbers.  I will get you the 
updated memo late Tuesday or early Weds.

In the meantime, of course, please let me know if additional infromation is 
desired.

Best Regards,

Eddy Daniels
