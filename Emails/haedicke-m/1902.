As all of you know Enron is kicking off its Fall, 2000 on campus recruiting 
effort soon.  After discussions with the Office of the Chairman we would like 
for you to help supplement the recruiting effort by attending the respective 
schools' presentations (listed below).  It is very important that we at ENA 
support the Analyst and Associate Program and be an active participant in the 
recruiting process.  These schools provide the basis for our talent pool and 
help us achieve excellence.  If you have any questions about your 
participation, please give me a call at ext 3-5275 or Celeste Roberts at ext 
3-0555.  Attached below are the schools we would like you to attend.  Thanks 
for your help.  Ted
