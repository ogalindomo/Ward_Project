I think it is both Rappaport and his target audience.  I think Dan needs to 
hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re 
electronic trading.  Silence by us could be misinterpreted by him.  Let me 
know what you think.

Do you really this the right avenue would be directly to Rappaport - isn't it 
his target audience?

Do we need to do this - do you think the other exchanges will do something?

Rappaport's comments are potentially very negative to us.  I think we should 
write him a letter in protest.    Mark
