Dan, initially Aleck Trawick was involved with our PPA position when this 
matter only involved what seemed to be a narrow administrative law dispute 
with respect to the Power Pool Council and its proposed rule changes.  
Frankly, I never envisioned that if we were to pursue or consider pursuing 
any remedies against Alberta, the Balancing Pool, the Power Pool Council 
and/or the Power Pool, that the matter would be handled by Aleck.  As you 
know Aleck is putting together a memo due today respecting certain of these 
issues.  After that, I would like responsibility for this matter and all 
litigation matters transferred to Robert Anderson and/or Dalton McGrath.

With respect to our conversation yesterday, the matter will be referred to 
Jim Derrick, General Counsel of Enron Corp., and has been reviewed with Mark 
Haedicke, John Lavorato, and Rob Milnthorp.  At this time in the year Jim is 
very busy, but Jim will review the matter and make decisions respecting the 
use of Canadian counsel sometime in the New Year.  From Rob Milnthorp's, John 
Lavorato's, Mark Haedicke's and my perspective, Robert's and Dalton's 
involvement in Enron litigation matters, and an increased profile for Mungo 
Hardwicke-Brown on commercial matters, will be integral to any decision 
involving Blakes.

In the meantime, please ensure that no new files for Enron or any of its 
affiliates, whether initiated out of Calgary, Toronto or Houston, are opened 
by Blakes without my prior knowledge or approval.

Regards, Peter.
