Subject: Eletrobolt Turbine Shipment

John:

We executed the transmission connection contract with Light (local 
distribution company) yesterday for the project.  Based on completing this 
agreement and our conversation, we are moving forward with the shipment of 
the turbines.  Initial loading of loose items will start this afternoon and 
turbines tomorrow with a planned departure of the ship on Sunday.  Let me 
know if you have any questions or comments?

Thanks,
Brett
