Mark:

In follow-up to our conversation at lunch Monday, I am hoping to take 
Thursday and Friday of next week off (December 14 and 15).  That will bring 
me down to having only a week left.  After that, I will be taking only a day 
or two on a "when it looks good" basis.  Let me know if  you have any 
concerns with that schedule.

Thanks,

Jeff
