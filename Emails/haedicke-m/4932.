Dear Subcommittee Members:

I am looking for a very senior "business" person with a solid knowledge
about the Brazilian derivatives market and that is fluent in English. ISDA
would like to invite him to speak in the Mexico Conference on May 8th in the
panel of OTC derivatives in Emerging Markets and Latin America.

As time is of the essence I would greatly appreciate it if you could please
submit your suggestions by Wednesday, April 18th

If you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Best regards,
