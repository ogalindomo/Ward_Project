Mark,

I received your voice mail and e-mail message re your summary for Jeff 
Skkilling.  I'll take a look at it and get back to you via e-mail before 
Monday.

I'm attaching a copy of (1) the working draft that examines the potential 
worst-case Enron Corp. and affiliate exposures under the Greenfield Shipping 
Company LNG ship finance documents (we expect to complete and release a final 
version of this memo early next week); and (2) several Payment Security 
Structure slides that were prepared by Bill Gathmann and Ranabir Dutt in 
connection with putting the structure together and explaining it to the Phase 
II lenders, ship lenders and major contract counterparties (including Oman 
LNG, AdGas and Greenfield Shipping Company).  Hope this proves useful!

Kind regards,
Dan
