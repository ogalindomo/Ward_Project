Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella 
in Public Relations.  The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark 
Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Americas be responsive when 
we are asked for information from our business units.  Please pass along to 
Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be 
responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter.  Kathie has 
assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do 
the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in 
paragraph form.  Michelle will send a reminder message to the contact person 
when the updates are needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

Under the direction of Mark Frevert, Public Relations has created a Weekly 
Electronic Newsletter giving employees the latest news in Enron Americas, 
Industrial Markets and Global Markets at the click of a button.  Our goal is 
to provide information about recent developments and events from the various 
business units straight from the source, YOU!  We need your cooperation and 
participation since EA/EGM/EIM readers want to know more about the Enron 
Americas.  Please help open the door for us by getting your direct reports on 
board and encouraging them to send us news.

Watch for a weekly reminder email, giving upcoming newsletter deadlines.  The 
deadline for the next newsletter is noon, Wednesday, December 6.  If you need 
assistance formatting your business highlights, Kathie Grabstald, the 
newsletter writer, will help turn your bullet points into paragraphs.

Sincerely,
Michelle Vitrella & Kathie Grabstald
