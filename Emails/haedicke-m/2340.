Enclosed are redlined and clean copies of the final versions of the Executive 
Summary and Policies and Procedures.  These have been revised per Lance 
Schuler's requested revisions.  Almost all of the changes are in the opening 
paragraph in each document.



Donna W.: please save the clean copies to your system as the final versions 
of our new policy.  Thanks -- Bob
