Paul:
I am not aware of any Enron entity considering the Y2K dispute resolution 
process you mentioned.  However, as you may have heard a recent federal law 
and a Texas law have been passed imposing a moratorium on Y2K lawsuits  for a 
certain number of months under certain conditions.   We are awaiting an 
analysis of the new laws from V&E and will forward that to you as soon as we 
receive it.  Please call if you would to discuss this further.
Best regards,
Mike
