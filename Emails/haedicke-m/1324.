I want to be involved as we are in the process of signing up employment 
contracts with Sami Arap, Louise Wantanabe and Vicki Martinez.  John Novak 
and I need to approve all the changes.  Thanks.

Mark

Kishkill is planning to adjust a couple of the legal guys salaries (Valle,

over competitors raiding us. How much do you want to be involved?
