Attached is a risk memo for your review in relation to the pending Project 
Crane pulp and paper acquisition.  The memo contains an executive summary of 
the transaction, as well as a more detailed discussion and outline of 
identified risks.  

Julia and I are on your schedule for tomorrow afternoon to review this 
document and the transaction.  In the meantime, if you should have any 
comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
