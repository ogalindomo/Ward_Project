Talked to Bill McCoy at Morgan, Stanley about the Richard Shelton affidavit.  
He was aware of the efforts made last week, but not directly involved, b/c he 
was out of the country.  Now that he's back, he said he would check into it 
further, but he's doubtful that Morgan will be able to take a public position 
on this.  Although the commodities group is definitely in favor of it, there 
might well be other constituents of the  Morgan Stanley/Dean Witter family of 
companies for whom such a position could be "too confining" in other 
circumstances when those other companies/groups might wish to take an 
opposite position.  He said he would look again at trying to get clearance, 
but he's not really hopeful.  He asked me whether Rich Shelton would have to 
actually testify, and I repeated what our counsel told us that 
cross-examination is likely but does not have to occur in Calgary.  He asked 
about our timetable and said he will call me back either way and will try to 
expedite it.  I'll keep you posted.

Regards,
Janice
