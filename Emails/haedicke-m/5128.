Mark,

We would very much like to consider using Black and Veatch for our Longview 
Project in Washington.  I understand that Enron is in the middle of 
litigation re a Puerto Rico project.  Despite our Caribbean problems, B&V is 
a large, credible firm with multiple project teams, including one that is 
well positioned to serve our needs in the Pacific Northwest.  

Are you aware of any issues in dealing with them?

Regards,

Chris
