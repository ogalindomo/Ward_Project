I certainly can respect your decision.  I hope you will change your mind
concerning the Gas Daily market.  Darryl Dworkin and Matt Handler have
worked that market for us for 4 years.  They have completely different
styles and personalities than the Gulf desk (actually more like Ray).

I hope that you will meet with these guys and then make your decision.  I
would hate to have that dinner cost Darryl and Matt an opportunity to work
with you.  I think they have always worked well with Enron.  Obviously, your
decision rules.

Thanks Again for the time,

Steve

I have received your E-Mail .

Steve,

I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events
that followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.
You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas
Dailys.


Thank You
