I will no longer be monitoring FERC issuances on a regular basis.  Tami Parr
is continuing to monitor California developments, and will distribute updates
and documents periodically.  If you're not already receiving postings from
Tami, and would like to, send her an email.  I can still provide occasional
assistance with FERC matters.

These are the relevant FERC sites:

CIPS--All issuances (orders, notices, news releases, meeting agendas, etc.):
