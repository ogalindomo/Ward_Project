Our first Gray-outs: These power outages are purely a failure of leadership


(Published March 21, 2001)=20
Add a new term to the electricity nomenclature -- the Gray-out. This is a=
=20
power outage caused by politics in Sacramento under Gov. Gray Davis, rather=
=20
than some unavoidable mismatch between supply and demand.

This is March. Peak demand is thousands upon thousands of megawatts lower=
=20
than it will be this summer. And yet the lights are going out.

These rolling Gray-outs trace squarely back to state government's failure t=
o=20
figure out a way to pay for all the power that California needs. The=20
generators who aren't getting paid are beginning to go temporarily out of=
=20
business. Day by day, less and less power is available for the grid, to the=
=20
point that a little bit of spring sun is enough to overtax supply and turn=
=20
out the lights. Unbelievable.

It's true that the governor is bleeding the state's coffers to the tune of=
=20
about $50 million every day to pay the big for-profit generators for their=
=20
supply. This is his short-term solution, until the longer-term solution --=
=20
whatever that is -- kicks in. But no, even that huge payment isn't all the=
=20
money needed to pay all the generators.

Neglected by the government plan are about 600 little guys that produce 20=
=20
percent of the electricity supply. These are generators dotted throughout t=
he=20
state known as Qualifying Facilities. A creation of the alternative energy=
=20
movement of the 1970s, these are plants powered by natural gas, the sun and=
=20
the wind. Unlike the big for-profit generating companies, these QFs are=20
contractually tied to the giant utilities, Southern California Edison and=
=20
PG&E. And the utilities haven't been paying them for weeks and weeks -- at=
=20
this point the QFs are owed $1.48 billion.

Not surprisingly, some of these generators can't afford to keep producing=
=20
power for free. Grid operators say that these QFs could be producing about=
=20
6,000 megawatts if they were being paid. Instead, they are producing about=
=20
3,100, and the amount is decreasing. Outages were triggered on Monday becau=
se=20
the grid was short about 1,000 megawatts of load. This math clearly reveals=
=20
how avoidable this disruption was. Call it a rolling Gray-out.

Bipartisan legislation has languished in Sacramento for weeks that would cu=
t=20
in half what these QFs have been billing the utilities. The savings are=20
possible by moving these contracts into long-term deals and out of the=20
higher-priced spot market. This piece of the overall solution has been=20
stalled while the governor has been at work on the others, such as returnin=
g=20
the big utilities to solvency and locking in power purchases long-term with=
=20
the big for-profit generators. Disregarding the little guys, however, is a=
=20
mistake that the governor and Legislature should correct immediately.
