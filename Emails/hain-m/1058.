Dale has a couple items to change on the MOU and then it is ready to go.  We 
should be able to get it to NPC today.

Don:

Where are you with providing comments back to NPC on the Interconnection 
agreement, did this get issued?  Also, where do we stand on the MOU with NPC?

Its important relative to our schedule that these items keep moving.

Please advise,
Jim
