Paul,
I am working with Ray Kindley on this matter.   I am replying for PGP and
it's members who are parties to the rate case, including Seattle City Light.


We received a hard copy of your three data requests regarding the Joint
Customer Testimony on either Saturday, March 10th or Monday, March 12th.  We
failed to date stamp initially, which is why I am not sure which day we
received it.  Today, I received amended versions of those data requests.
Because of the confusion I intend to respond only to the amended version on
Tuesday, March 20th, which splits the difference between the initial and the
amended version due dates.  Please let me know if there is any problem with
handling the responses in this manner.  Thank you in advance for your
courtsey.
