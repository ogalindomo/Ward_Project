Mary,

your thoughts on how we define who is subject to this rule would be 
appreciated.

Paul, FYI, there will be a call at 1 p.m PST with Briggs, Gannet, Wyden's 
office, and Eachus re: information access legislation.

Attached is the most current version of the legislation, which will be
included
in Senator Bingaman's bill that will be introduced this week.  However, if
there
are additional changes you think should be made, we can still incorporate
them
in a separate bill Senator Wyden intends to introduce in the near future.

    I incorporated the comments I got back from FERC last week, as well as
the
ones you forwarded to me, and put the revised version in the Democratic
energy
bill.
