There are increasing requests for IT development resources for databases and 
websites within the group.  There are two issues involved regarding this 
activity:  Enron Networks is now charging for such development, and the 
production of these many and various projects leads to high maintenance needs 
and projects are often abandoned after short use.

If you need a new database, it should be developed in one of the desktop 
applications that everyone has - Word, Excel or Access. Such 
documents/databases can be shared on the O: Common/Public Affairs drive.  If 
your needs are more complex than these applications will support, or if your 
needs are more global, an effort should be made to fit the data into the 
Project Tracking database.  Contact Elizabeth Linnell for this global 
database. 

Products/information to be published to the intranet should be placed on the 
existing Public Affairs intranet site. Having multiple sites is confusing to 
our customers and an ineffective use of resources, as well as expensive to 
develop and maintain.  Contact Earlene O'Connell regarding additions to the 
website.
