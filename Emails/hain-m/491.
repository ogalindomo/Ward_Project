>> Hs_an Tsang described the gleaming, painted giant stone Buddhas standing
in
>> their cave-niches along the Bamiyan Valley as he passed through there on
>> foot, on his way to India, in the 7th century AD.  Last week they were
>> blown up by the Taliban.  Not just by the Taliban, but by nature-denying
>> authoritarian worldviews that go back much farther than Islam.  The whole
>> world lost another bit of beauty, generosity, and inspiration last week.
>> May we keep our minds clear and calm in the present moment, and honor the
>> dust.

>> Not even
>> under mortar fire
>> do they flinch;
>> the Buddhas of Bamiyan
>> take refuge in the dust.
