I recommend that we consider filing a motion for summary rejection of the 
ISO's proposal on the ground that it is the product of an illegal board 
seated in violation of FERC's governance orders that is a highly politicized 
tool of Governor Davis, rather than an independent body.  In addition to the 
legal arguments for dismissal, we could also rebut the ISO's economic and 
market analysis.
