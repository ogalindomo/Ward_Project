  ISO Market Participants:
  Attached is revised draft New Facility Interconnection
Policy (NFIP) Tariff language reflecting changes since our stakeholder
meeting on Monday. These changes have yet not been reviewed internally
within the ISO, but we wanted to give you the most recent version for your

the draft Tariff language again after receiving your comments tomorrow.
