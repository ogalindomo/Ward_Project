Attached is our filing made yesterday protesting Entergy's proposed transco:

Rate issues are premature until Entergy has filed to join SPP
No support for its proposed Innovative Rates (for example, (i) Entergy would 
get 5% of a customer-funded transmission project as a development fee and 
(ii) extra 300 basis points for certain projects) and Exact Recovery mechanism
Request that Commission require grandfathered contracts to be addressed
Express concern of Entergy's request to continue the problematic source and 
sink limitations
