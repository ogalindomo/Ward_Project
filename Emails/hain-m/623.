  ISO Market Participants:
  Earlier today, I sent a message announcing a conference call
next Tuesday to discuss implementation issues surrounding the ISO's proposed
Market Stabilization Plan.  In that message, I implied that the ISO would be
filing the Market Stabilization Plan with FERC this week. The filing we plan
to submit to FERC this week is only the ISO's comments on the FERC staff's
own Market Power Monitoring and Mitigation Proposal. We do not plan to file
the Market Stabilization Plan until after the March 30 Board meeting.
  I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
