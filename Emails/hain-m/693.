We got through our firestorm for today.

A bunch of filings on Thursday is next.

I asked Jim if Joe Hartsoe needs to sign off on each filing no matter how 
small. He said that there is no hard and fast rule -- use good judgement 
basically.  Joe needs to know about each filing.  He should be given time to 
review the bigger pleadings, but for smaller ones a heads up may be all that 
is necessary.  Hope this helps.
