In the April 26 Order regarding the RTO West filing, FERC rejected the
Agreement Limiting Liability, reiterating prior holdings that FERC would
not approve a tariff limiting a transmission provider's liability to its
transmission customers.  The Filing Utilities have filed a request for
rehearing of that rejection.  A copy of the pleading can be found at:
http://www.rtowest.org/Index_Page_RTOWest_FilingUtilities_FERCDocs.htm

    The Filing Utilities attended a technical conference with FERC Staff
on this issue, and there is apparently some receptivity to amending the
order if the Filing Utilities can show there is a difference in
liability exposure between the Order 888 OATT environment and an RTO
environment.
    Please let me know if there is any interest in the IPP/marketer
group submitting comments on the request.
