Attached below is EPMI's request to FERC for clarification that SPP should 
not proceed with spending $45 million to implement a market design until FERC 
approves SPP as an RTO and establishes the independent board.  Our request 
uses FERC's ruling telling Gridflorida not to do this.  (We also filed a 
similar request in GridSouth last month.)
