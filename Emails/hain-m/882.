Please remove any items you have in the refrigerator immediately.  The 
cleaners will be here in a couple of hours and any unmarked items will be 
thrown away.  Thanks for your help with this.

Subject: Please Remove Your Items in the Fridge by Tomorrow


Please be advised that Servicemaster will conduct a thorough "spring 
cleaning" of our kitchen this coming Monday (3/12). 

This cleaning calls for all items in the refrigerator to be accounted for, 
otherwise the items will be thrown out.  To account for your refrigerator 
items, simply post your name on the container.  If there is no name 
associated with the item, it will be discarded.  Remember, your deadline is 5 
PM Friday.

Thank you for your cooperation!
