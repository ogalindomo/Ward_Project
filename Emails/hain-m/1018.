Reg Folks -- Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please 
make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are 
working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes 
anything.  Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve 
available.   However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the 
traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later).  For example, 
there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set 
point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many 
other methods too.)  In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can 
take out of merit generators. 

Let's make sure and keep the communication between our reg groups and with 
the traders flowing on these issues.  THANKS.
