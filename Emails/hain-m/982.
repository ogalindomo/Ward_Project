As agreed at last week's tariff integration group meeting, I will be
collecting and organizing the revisions/options we discussed for the RTO
West Tariff ADR provision.  I owe the compiled results to Sarah by Friday,
March 2, so would appreciate getting whatever you can provide to me by
Thursday, March 1, at the latest.

The assignments as I recorded them are:

Carl:  Fast-track option
Don:  Parties can agree to take all, or part, of dispute to FERC
Gary:  Default: baseball or not?
Mary:  Applicability to unaccepted service agreements.
Paul:  Preliminary required mediation?
Paul w/ Shelly:  Source(s) for mediators/arbitrators.

Attached for your convenience are the fast-track intereconnection and
regular ADR provisions from the TOA.
