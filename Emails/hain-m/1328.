Attached is a White Paper prepared by the Liability and Insurance SubGroup.  
I am sending this to the list that was on Stan's recent e-mail, as I have not 
had time to check the list on the website.  I had expected that Barney would 
be able to send this out, but he is out of town today.  Sorry for the delay.

Gary A. Dahlke.

A typo has invaded my email address in the Legal Work Group mailings going
around, so I am missing emails.  My correct email address is
"sberman@hewm.com"  Thanks.
