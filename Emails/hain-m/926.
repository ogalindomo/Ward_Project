> Over the last few months the ISO has discussed some basic principles for a
> new Demand Responsiveness program. This program, the Discretionary Load
> Curtailment Program (DLCP), is intended to attract significant voluntary
> curtailments before the ISO enters into emergency conditions.  The DLCP,
> which is a combination of a Day Ahead and Day Of, is an energy-only
> payment program and gives Loads the control that many need, to feel
> comfortable participating in a demand response program.

> We request that you review the attached draft description of the program.
> Any feedback would be helpful for us as we near completion of the program
> design.  You may send your comments to Glen Perez, gperez@caiso.com .  We
> would appreciate any comments you might have by Monday March 12th.
