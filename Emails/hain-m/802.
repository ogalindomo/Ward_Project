RE: Regulatory Affairs Washington Staff
      ? First Meeting Scheduled for Thursday, March 29th at
        Noon

Members have asked that EPSA begin coordinating regular meetings for the 
regulatory staff of our member companies here in Washington, D.C.  Like we do 
for the legislative affairs staff, EPSA would plan twice-a-month informal 
meetings to provide opportunities to share information and discuss strategy 
and tactics.  The group will not develop EPSA policy.

The first meeting of the group will be held at the new EPSA office on 
Thursday, March 29th at noon.  Lunch will be provided.  The office is located 
at 1401 New York Ave., N.W., 11th floor.  The agenda will include 
organizational issues, including future meeting format and schedules.

If you are planning to attend, please RSVP using the form below to Jackie 
Gallagher either by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).
