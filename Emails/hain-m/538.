Mary,

Good luck to you!  I think I remember you saying that you could just as
easily live in New England.

I'm glad we worked together enough for me to get to know you!  I've been to
the NEISO several times, and you'll likely run into other TCA'ers out there.
I look forward to seeing you again sometime soon.  And if I or others at TCA
can be of assistance (either formally, or informally) feel free to let me
know.

Best wishes!
Ellen.



I am going to be the Senior Regulatory Counsel at ISO New England starting
on April 9, 2001.   My last day in the Portland area will be March 31,
2001.  I enjoyed working with you and wish you the best of everything.  My
new address will be:

Mary Hain
Senior Regulatory Counsel
ISO New England Inc.
One Sullivan Road
Holyoke, MA  01040-2841
