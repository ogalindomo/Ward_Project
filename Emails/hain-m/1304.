Paul-welcome back.  I have taken the following positions that may (or may=
=20
not) come up at the RRG meeting. Even if the issues don't come up, I wanted=
=20
to give you an update:
 =01=07  The security coordinator (SC) should be part of the RTO.  In the N=
W, the =20
SC contracts with the utilities.  The proposal is to have the RTO contract=
=20
with the SC . In the East, Tabors studied SCs and found they allowed the=20
transmission owners (TO) to discriminate. However, there, the SC is employe=
d=20
by the TO. I need to know more about how the NW SC contract is structured a=
nd=20
talk to Tabors before I would feel comfortable giving up on this issue.  Do=
=20
others have opinions on this?
=01=07 I support moving the load integration agreement (LIA) and generation=
=20
integration agreement (GIA) into the tariff.  I am developing momentum for=
=20
this.
=01=07 Concerning governance, I drafted a paper opposing state agencies vot=
ing for=20
board members. I also oppose  a member class for a catchall member class.  =
I=20
would also oppose a class for the state commissions if they are given the=
=20
right tovote for directors.
