On 3/14/01, FERC upheld a provision in a utility pro forma interconnection 
agreement, which provides that the terms and conditions of the IA would be 
superseded by any pertinent interconnection provisions required by an RTO, if 
the utility joins an RTO.  (APS case)

We have been monitoring RTO proposed interconnection procedures and IA 
provisions and commenting as necessary.  We need to be mindful of this order 
as we negotiate IAs for our sites to the extent that such a provision is 
included in the draft IA.
