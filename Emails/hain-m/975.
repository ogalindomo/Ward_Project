I assume that this is being done to meet the needs of Richard Sanders' legal 
team?

I have attached a revised version to the complaint that I sent out last 
night, along with a redlined version.  In addition to some wordsmithing and 
the like, please note footnote 1, which is new.  We are still researching for 
California cases that support the FERC cases we have cited (for proposition 
that economic hardship does not constitute force majuere).

This needs to be filed today, so please give me your comments quickly.  
Thanks.  Ron
