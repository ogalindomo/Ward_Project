		 Subject: State Controller Kathleen Connell Press Conference



> State Controller Kathleen Connell held a press conference today to voice
> her concerns over electricity power purchases' effect on the State's
> general fund and in response to a letter received March 12 from Department
> of Finance Director Tim Gage and Chief Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill
> requesting a transfer of money from the General Fund.
> 
> Connell stated that Current financial information related to the purchase
> of electricity and the general fund is as follows:
> *State's general fund surplus has dropped from $8.5 billion in January to
> a current estimated level of $3.2 billion
> *Receipt of a letter from the Department of Finance Director and the Chief
> Legislative Analyst requesting an additional transfer of $5.6 billion to
> the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties to cover power purchases
> *To cover this transfer, Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4
> billion
> *Connell: "We started this year with a generous budget surplus; the energy
> crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the
> electricity purchases would put the [General] fund at risk."
> *Debt issuance has not occurred to reimburse the General Fund for power
> purchases, while disbursements from the General Fund increase daily
> 
> Controller Connell sent a letter to the Governor today, calling for the
> following steps to be taken:
> 1. DWR to notify the Controller's office of any purchases made and any
> contracts negotiated to date
> 2. DWR to notify the Controller's office of any future purchases and
> contracts within 7 days, regardless of when the invoices are submitted
> 3. Information on purchases in excess of $55 million  should be submitted
> within 24 hours
> 4. DWR should prepare new General Fund cash flow estimates for the next 30
> and 60 days, and for the end of the fiscal year
> 5. DWR should take action to ensure that bond sales are completed by the
> end of May 2001
> 
> The Controller is also ordering an audit of the DWR resources to determine
> the amount of money being spent by the Department.  Currently, Connell
> said, "I have to rely on press reports as valid to determine the amount of
> money spent in power purchases."  She said she needs "acknowledgement of
> the total amount of liabilities made" by DWR.
