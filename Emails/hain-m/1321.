Gary,

Your list does not appear to address the issue of RTO liability for
costs caused by issuance of invalid operating instructions.  This issue
is very important to the parties (generators and Scheduling
Coordinators) who will be obligated to comply with the RTO Tariff.

I've raised this issue several times now at RRG meetings, but it
apparently has not yet taken hold at the Legal Work Group.

I have not been able to raise the issue at the meetings of your subgroup
because of conflicts with other NWRTO meetings, and I will not be able
to attend your future subgroup meeting (again, due to conflicts with
other NWRTO meetings), so I've attempted to frame the issue through the
attached, hastily-drafted issue paper.

Please contact me if you need additional explanation of the concerns
stated in the paper.

Thanks,

Carl Imparato
