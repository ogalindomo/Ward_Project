Attached please find a revised version of the revised version together with a 
redline version of the proposed complaint.  We have incorporated many of 
Bracewell's changes but our approach, on behalf of Sempra Energy Trading, is 
to state the legal argument first (that the CalPX's use of the tariff is 
wrong) followed by the equitable argument that its doing so was unjust and 
unreasonable.  We feel that this presents a stronger argument for retroactive 
application.
