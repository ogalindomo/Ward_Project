RE: EPSA Draft Comments on FTC Request for Comments on
                Retail Electricity Competition Plans
? Conference Call on Monday, April 2nd at 2:00 p.m. (EDT)
? Comments Due April 3rd

On February 28, 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a request for 
information regarding the outcome to date of the different regulatory and 
legislative approaches states have taken to the introduction of retail 
electric competition.  The FTC is examining various state retail competition 
programs to determine which features have resulted in consumer benefits, and 
which have not.  EPSA's comments do not answer every question in the 
Commission's notice, but instead take a broad view of competitive markets to 
date.  A draft copy of EPSA's comments is attached for your review.

Comments are due at the FTC on April 3rd.  We will discuss the attached draft 
during our West region conference call on Monday, April 2nd at 2:00 p.m. 
(EDT).  To access this call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the 
EPSA/Samantha Slater call.  Please forward all comments to Samantha Slater 
(sslater@epsa.org or 202-628-8200) no later than the close of business on 
Friday, March 30th.  If you have any questions, comments or concerns about 
the draft and cannot participate on the conference call, please contact 
Samantha Slater before Monday's conference call.
