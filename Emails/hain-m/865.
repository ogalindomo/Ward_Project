		 Subject: Status of California Cases


Jim/Richard:

Per your request, I have attached a memo that describes the status of Enron's 
participation in cases concerning the California investigation and related 
market issues established since FERC's December 15, 2000 order, including 
cases for which the date for intervention has not yet passed.  Please call me 
if you wish to discuss or have any questions.
