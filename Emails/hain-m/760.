I have looked through this for the East (outside of Northeast) and have 
alerted our folks to retail filings and the commercial people to several IAs 
and agreements that may be of interest.  I don't see anything else in which 
we need to intervene.

P.S.  Dynegy (Coral, etc.) is filing a request for rehearing of the Southern 
source and sink approval.  EPMI intervened, but did not take a position due 
to our pending sale of Caledonia to Cinergy (which FERC approved on Friday).  
We plan to look into filing a complaint against Southern for selling parking 
type services.  I am working with Kevin and will keep you all informed if we 
proceed.
