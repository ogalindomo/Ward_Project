In a recent organizational memo, I mentioned what a great time this is to b=
e=20
at Enron.  I believe that more strongly than ever, given the new markets we=
=20
are entering, the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou=
nd=20
the world that best fit with our core competencies, and the phenomenal grow=
th=20
of the company, perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first=
=20
quarter.  But, there are challenges as well: California, and its regional a=
nd=20
global implications, and the general market conditions that have brought ou=
r=20
stock price well off its recent highs.  With respect to each of these and=
=20
other challenges, there are invariably opportunities: for example, the=20
enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale=20
electricity markets in the context of California; and, in the context of a=
=20
lower stock price, a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will=
=20
bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future.  One way=
=20
that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit=
=20
more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron.  We in Government=20
Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to=
=20
instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few=20
years.  We have always done our part, but there is always more that can be=
=20
done.

To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, I recently met=
=20
with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government=20
Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively.  We looked at group=
=20
travel costs, outside services, and other budget items.  Attached for your=
=20
review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy,=
=20
which I believe, will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost=
=20
savings.  Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr=
on=20
Europe. (Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied=
,=20
where applicable)

Further, as a result of our review of the budget, we have identified saving=
s=20
across the North American group in excess of 1.5 million dollars (USD).  Th=
is=20
is in addition to almost 2 million dollars (USD) by which the Enron Europe=
=20
Government Affairs budget has been reduced, as well as significant reductio=
ns=20
that have occurred in the South American group. Finally, I have also decide=
d=20
to create a global government affairs hiring committee, which will evaluate=
=20
the need for any proposed hires (new and existing positions).  The purpose =
of=20
the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and, assuming it=
=20
is, determine the most effective way to fill the position.  By encompassing=
 a=20
cross-section of the Government Affairs group globally, it is my hope that =
we=20
will arrive at better hiring decisions.  The hiring committee will consist =
of=20
Aleck Dadson (Toronto), Sue Nord (Houston), Jim Steffes (Houston), Paul=20
Dawson (London), Doug Wood (London), Nick O=01,Day (Tokyo), Sergio Assad (S=
ao=20
Paulo), Linda Robertson (Washington) and myself.   The committee will meet =
on=20
an as needed basis.

I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide=
=20
more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support.=
 =20
I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback.=20

Thank you
