Hi Sarah,  Here is the compilation of ADR-related "options.".  I haven't yet
received anything from Mary or Don, so these sections are not included in
this version.

I started to incorporate the various pieces of this into the ADR provision
itself, but it quickly became clear that was not going to be a productive
task until we narrow the options.

I will not be in Portland next week, but will dial in if that option is
available.  Thanks, Paul
