At Mary Hain's request, the following are times Andrea Chambers and I would 
be available for the call:

- today 3/15: very problematic; possibly after 3:00 Denver time but will have 
to confirm;

- tomorrow 3/16: pretty open until 4:00 Denver time

- Monday 3/19:  OK except between 12 and 3 Denver time

Let me know what works for you; I apologize for being very tied up today.  JM
