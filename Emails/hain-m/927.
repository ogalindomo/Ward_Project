Good Morning,

We will be rolling out a new version of Deal Entry & Deal Blotter this 
afternoon to support California scheduling & volume management.  For most of 
the users, there will be no impact except for a few new fields that can be 
ignored in Enpower's Deal Entry.  Below is a list of the changes:


Deal Entry (These fields should only be populated for California deals)
1.  Added Settlement Entity - Identifies where the power is scheduled and 
settled.

2.  Added Sched Coordinator - Identifies the coordinator responsible for 
scheduling the power.

3.  Schedule Type - Defines the type of schedule used in California.

4.  Market Reference - Defines the market when the power will flow.

Deal Blotter 
1.  Deal Blotter will be defaulting these 4 values if the deal is in 
California.

Thanks,  David Poston
