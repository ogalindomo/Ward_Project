Please start drafting the intervention, as you've described and send me an 
estimate for the RCR.

Robin Gibbs called and said that he agreed that we should intervene and 
support Mirant on the ISO credit issue.  He said that Mirant's complaint is 
consistent with the jurisdictional issues that he and Richard have been 
working on.  Let me know if you would like an RCR estimate.   Ron
