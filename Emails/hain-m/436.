Hello, everyone!
?
As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on  March 23 may 
recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work  process be 
restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near  term we 
should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional  work 
efforts once the critical path items have been more fully  developed.
?
In response to these suggestions, we have substantially  revised the RTO West 
meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the  entire month of 
April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO  West Stage 2 
Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link  below:

?
Please note that this revised calendar for the most part  
reflects?cancellations of meetings of work groups whose work has been  
temporarily suspended.? The areas of primary focus for the near term are  the 
congestion model and work on suspension of existing transmission agreements  
among Filing Utilities and the corresponding transfer payments and conversion 
of  rights.? Those working?in these areas may schedule additional meetings  
in April as needed.? There will be?one additional area of work during  April, 
which will involve taking an integrated approach to dealing with issues  
around tort liability, commercial liability, and credit worthiness and 
credit  risk.? Gary Dahlke sent out an e-mail?on this topic some weeks ago 
to  the people who participated in the Stage 1 work on the Agreement 
Limiting  Liability.? So far there are no scheduled meetings?for this 
additional  work effort, but we expect there will be some meetings scheduled 
during the  month of April.
?
Please be assured that the areas in which work is being  temporarily 
suspended?will be addressed; it is just a matter of marshalling  everyone's 
resources in the near term to the most critical tasks.
?
Thank you all very much for your helpful comments and  suggestions.
