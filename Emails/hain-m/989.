Subject: Re: Hendricks v. Dynegy


I have recommended this before and continue to believe that it should (and 
could successfully) be pursued.  Could someone forward the Hendricks 
pleading?  On instruction from Richard, I would be happy to start the 
lobbying campaign at FERC (and possibly the SG's office as well) to secure 
such a supportive pleading.

Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in
the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file
a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field"
of wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered?
