It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion regarding the 
Lobbying Questionnaire that I sent out on Feb. 20, 2001 and which is due on 
March 9, 2001.  Please note that it is NOT necessary to gather your expenses 
attributable to your lobbying activities rather I just need an allocation of 
your time/hours spent engaging in such activity during the year 2000.  I 
apologize for any confusion.  Thank you - Tara Rafter
