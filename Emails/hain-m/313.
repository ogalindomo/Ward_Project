Hello --

I just wanted to confirm that the work of the PRRQ has been suspended until
further notice.  (At a minimum the meetings in April will not take place.)
In April, the RTO West Stage 2 Development Process will focus on congestion
management, contract conversion, liability issues, and limited seams work
(although there might some other isolated activity as well).

Thanks!  I look forward to when the PRRQ restarts!  Kristi
