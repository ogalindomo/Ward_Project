As part of our continuing communication we would like to inform you that a 
memorial scholarship fund has been established in memory of Chad Garren, who 
died during Tropical Storm Allison Friday night. "The Chad Garren Memorial 
Scholarship Fund" will benefit a student at Weatherford High School, 
Weatherford, Texas attending Texas A & M University. Chad was a Global 
Technology intern, working in ETS.  If you are interested in contributing to 
this fund, please send your donations to Community Relations EB1635a. Checks
