Mr. Murphy,
Jay Waldron has asked me to follow up with you regarding his email
yesterday, in which he explained that PGP and Seattle City Light will be
responding to your data requests on Tuesday, March 20th.  This response date
was a split between the due dates for the initial requests and the amended
requests.  Your verification that there will be no problem with handling the
responses in this manner would be appreciated.  Thank you in advance for
your courtesy.
