Mary:

Good luck in your new job. If you ever come through Boston look us up. We
are in Cambridge in Harvard Square (land of economic consultants). I have
done quite a bit of work on the New England market in the past, especially
on market design issues, and have always enjoyed it. Are you from New
England? I remember you went on holiday in Maine last autumn.

All the best,


Seabron
