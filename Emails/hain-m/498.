Hi Folks,
?
Just passing this on:
?
If you know of anyone who fits this description please pass this on and to
your lists, if possible.? Thank you.
_______
? More to the point, I need your help.? The Senator's office wants a list of 
as many women we can find who were prosecuted for out of wedlock 
sex/illegitimacy and lost their children.


? PLEASE FORWARD A NOTICE TO ALL LISTS WHERE WE MIGHT

FIND THESE WOMEN, ESPECIALLY IF THE CASES TOOK PLACE IN NY.


? Ask them to call the NY office & give their names, brief particulars, 
address, phone & e-mail. This could include not only the adjudicated ("You 
were convicted of a crime?!" said the assistant) but anyone who was coerced 
or their children.

Senator Roy Goodman
Albany office:? 518-455-2211
District office: 212-298-5515.
