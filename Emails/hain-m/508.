I read of your news today regarding moving on to the NE ISO. You'll do 
great.  I wish you only  the best and want to thank you for all of your 
efforts and hard work on behalf of the company.  Please feel free to call 
upon me if there is anything I can do. I hope we can stay in touch. (you will 
see alot of Dan Allegretti). Thanks again... and I mean it, even if  you're 
not inclined to believe me totally at the moment.
