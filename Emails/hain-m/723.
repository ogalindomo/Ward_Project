To Members of the RTO West Stage 2 Provisions and Requirements Content
Group:

Hello!

As you know, the next meeting of the Provisions and Requirements Content
Group is Wednesday, March 21st, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at the
Portland Airport Hilton Garden Inn.  I have prepared and attach an
agenda for your review.

I am also attaching the summary of the GIA Exemption Small Group
conference call; the 3/3 Provisions and Requirements Working Document
(this has already been distributed but for ease of reference I am
sending it again); and the final discussion paper regarding generation
interconnections.

Thanks!  I look forward to seeing you next week, Kristi
