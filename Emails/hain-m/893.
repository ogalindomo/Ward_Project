Subject: Notification to PX Participants



Participants:

Last Friday, January 26th, the Special and Correcting Invoices for the
Southern
California Edison (SCE) default were due and there were some Participants
who
failed to comply with Schedule 2. Section 4.3.2. of the PX Tariff which
states,
"All payments by the PX Participants shall be made to the PX Clearing
Account
via the Fedwire System for funds to be received at the PX Clearing Account
no
later than noon PPT on the Payment Due Date."

Additionally, Schedule 2, Section 5.5 of the PX Tariff requires the PX to
identify such Participants to all other affected PX Participants by the most
expeditious means available.  In accordance with Section 5.5, here is a list
of
PX Participants not in compliance with Section 4.3.2. for the SCE default:

   American Electric Power Service Corporation
   Arizona Public Service
   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
   Pacific Gas & Electric
   Sacramento Municipal Utility District
   Salt River Project

Each PX Participant's pro-rata portion of the shortfall from the
Participants
mentioned above will be communicated to them individually in the next couple
of
days.  If you should have questions, please call Clark Cheng at 626-537-3243
or
Chris Anderson at 626-537-3377.

Thank You.
