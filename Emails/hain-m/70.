The officers of the Natural Gas Roundtable would like to invite you to
attend a NGR luncheon on Thursday, June 14.  We are very pleased that Rep.
J. C. Watts, Jr. has agreed to be the guest speaker for this lunch and he
will discuss national energy, energy security and price stability.  You do
not need to be a member of the Roundtable to attend.  Attached is a notice
with more details regarding this luncheon.  If you would like to attend,
please RSVP to me by noon on Tuesday, June 12.  Hope to see you Thursday!
