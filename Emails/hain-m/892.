Asem/Bill,

I have talked to Mary Hain regarding our non-ability to gather information 
out of our Harvester from certain parties, in particular WAPA, WALC, PCW, 
Idaho.  She has some contacts at  all of those.  Could you give me a brief 
summary of who you have contacted and exactly what the hold up is?  And some 
input as to how you would like us to approach it from legal.  This will be a 
friendly push, so hopefully we get a friendly response!  

Thanks,

Diana
