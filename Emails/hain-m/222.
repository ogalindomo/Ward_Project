ATTORNEY GENERAL DEMANDS RELIANT ENERGY RECORDS FOR PROBE OF POSSIBLE 
PRICE-GOUGING, ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AFFECTING ELECTRICITY PRICES
Also Demands Energy Records From the Mirant Corporation

(SAN FRANCISCO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today demanded that Reliant 
Energy and the Mirant Corporation produce documents subpoenaed in the 
California Department of Justice investigation of possibly unlawful or 
anti-competitive behavior affecting soaring electricity prices in the state.

"There must be a short-circuit here because Reliant is claiming cooperation 
with our investigation while refusing to turn over documents," Lockyer said.

The Attorney General asked the San Francisco Superior Court to order Reliant 
and Mirant to produce subpoenaed documents that were due March 19. The 
Attorney General told the court that both power companies have failed to 
furnish documents despite being given assurances on the confidentiality of 
their sensitive and proprietary information. 

"Reliant's sole basis for refusing to produce confidential information is its 
claim that the Attorney General may not share such information with other 
governmental agencies that the Attorney General may enlist to aid him in his 
investigation," the Attorney General stated in the complaint. "The argument 
simply lacks merit."

"Reliant has sufficient guarantees regarding the confidentiality of its 
information," the complaint said.  "The Attorney General has stated that he 
will not share confidential data with governmental agencies which have acted 
as Reliant's competitors in the market or agencies with whom Reliant is 
negotiating energy contracts. Disclosure of confidential information by any 
subordinate officer is a misdemeanor and punishable by that officer being 
disqualified from acting in any official capacity in the department. Any 
government agency receiving information from the Attorney General to aid him 
in his investigation would be bound by the same requirement."

Similar arguments were made in seeking subpoenaed documents from power 
company Mirant.
