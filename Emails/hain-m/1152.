Has this already been taken care of? I didn't get an e-mail or hard copy, so 
I thought I would follow-up.

Let me know!

Thanks,
Grace

Mary, I understand you received a copy of the NPC interconnect facilities 
agreement for Priscilla.  Would you please e-mail a copy to Don, Dale, Stan 
and I.  If you only have a hard copy, please see Grace and she can make a 
copy for all of us. Thank you.
