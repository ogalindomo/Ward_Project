Yes, this question pertains to generation owned or controlled in California.  
Since Enron does not own or control any generation in California this data 
request would not apply.

Concerning your Data Request to Generators #2, I believe this question was
sent to us in error.  Enron Power Marketing does not own any generation in
California, so these questions do not apply.  Please let me know if I have
read the question incorrectly.
