Try Lynn Richardson for a primary contact. BUT, she would not be my first 
choice for reliable good information.

Subject: WACM Transmission Losses


Attached is a spreadsheet showing your entity's loss obligation to WACM for 
the period March 1 through 10.  You have already received March 1-5 
accounting last week.  However, I changed the tracking slightly and now all 
the days of each month appear in one file, so that March 6th through the 10th 
is the only new data you are receiving.

Please ensure that you are calculating and delivering the concurrent losses 
with the parent tag.  As of this time, there were no prices posted for Palo 
Verde nonfirm for March 9th or 10th.

Please let me know if you have specific feedback about something in the list 
or if you have any questions.  Thanks.
