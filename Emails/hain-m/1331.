Legal Work Group
Please find attached a ppt presentation prepared by John Buechler as a follow
up to a commitment made  at the Governance Workshop. Listed below is an
excerpt of the email that John outlined what he has done to respond to the
request.

Attached please find a summary of the "Board Qualifications" topic that I was
asked to prepare for the Legal Governance WG at the workshop.

I have taken my slides on the NYISO, PJM, ISO-NE and MISO, added Desert Star
from Dennis' presentation and a review of their by-laws, and added the IndeGO
provisions from Eric's presentation.

Then, I have compared the provisions among these entities and attempted to
identify the similarities and differences among them.  I then pose a number of
Issues for consideration by the NWRTO WG relative to Board qualifications.

For information and reference, I have also included the slides showing the
present Board members of these existing ISO's.

Please let me know if this suits your purpose.

Thanks

John Buechler
