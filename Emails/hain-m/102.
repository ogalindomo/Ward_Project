Good afternoon, Mary.  I work in the San Francisco Enron office and we have 
received some mail addressed to you.  Both envelopes have the same return 
address of - Spiegel & McDiarmid, 1350 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, 
D.C. 20005-4798.   I tried to locate your address on People Finder, but 
didn't have much luck.  If you could e-mail or call me with your location I 
could forward these on to you.  Thanks!
