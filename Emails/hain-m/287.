Calif. Gov. Davis, SoCal Edison to announce deal

(Adds background,

LOS ANGELES, April 9 (Reuters) - California Governor Gray Davis and Souther=
n=20
California Edison have reached an agreement after a weekend of harried talk=
s=20
aimed at a deal that would provide state money to the cash-strapped utility=

in exchange for its transmission lines, a spokesman for the governor said.

Davis and John Bryson, the chairman of Southern California Edison parent=20
Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), scheduled a news conference from 3=
=20
p.m. PDT (6 p.n. EDT) in Los Angeles to discuss the agreement, the governor=
's=20
office said. No further details were immediately available.

The announcement came as bankruptcy proceedings began for the state's large=
st=20
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news),=20
which on Friday sought protection for creditors after declaring that it had=

Shares in Edison International closed up 8 percent on Monday on expectation=
s=20
that the two sides were close to reaching a deal under which the state woul=

Southern California Edison power transmission grid is a 12,000-mile (19,200=

The lines carry electricity from power plants to substations, where the=20

distribution lines to homes and businesses.

The utility's 88,000-miles (105,600 km) of distribution lines serve about 1=

The utility has carried the lines at a book value of $1.2 billion. Under a=

$2.76 billion, or 2.3 times the book value.
