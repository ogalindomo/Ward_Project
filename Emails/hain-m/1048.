Hi Mary, I have left voice mails with both Debi LeVine (Director of
Contracts) and Roger Smith (Senior Regulatory Counsel) of the CAISO.
Roger's no. is 916-608-7135.  I reached Debi through the operator at
916-608-7100.  If I hear back, I will briefly describe our mission re: the
RTO West tariff integration group, try to get a contact that we can work
with, and then either refer them to you or try a 3-way call if they are
interested in following up right then.  Paul
