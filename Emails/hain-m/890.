 I agree with Howard but we have some additional information about the PX's
attitude towards the FERC proceding vis-a-vis the bankrupty court which we
will  relate at 3.  Pleading needs to be revised on settlement judge point
at a minimum.

Subject: Re: Response to PX Answer to Chargeback Complaint


Thanks for the draft.  We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11.
It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and
that even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately
overlaps the role of the bankruptcy court.
