> GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES STATE AGREEMENTS TO SPUR ENERGY EFFICIENT
> BUILDINGS 03/20/2001 
> 
> SACRAMENTO 
> 
> Governor Gray Davis today announced that the California Energy Commission
> has signed 12 grants and contracts totaling almost $9.2 million to install
> "energy smart" technology in commercial and industrial buildings
> throughout the state.
> 
> "Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will
> translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most - and
> beyond," Governor Davis said. "With these grants in place, California will
> continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency."
> 
> The agreements signed by Governor Davis will account for about 93
> megawatts of projected savings from buildings outfitted with demand
> responsive building systems technology. Demand responsive building systems
> work by using software that automatically dim lights, reduce air
> conditioning use, and cut other electrical loads. They operate in response
> to signals from the Independent System Operator (ISO) or from an electric
> utility or service provider.
> 
> Under the agreements, commercial electricity customers will agree to shave
> peak loads by 10 to 30 percent upon receiving the signal from the ISO.
> They will be paid by the ISO to curtail electricity load in their
> buildings in real time.
> 
> In addition to these grants, the Governor also announced that an
> additional eight megawatts of electricity would be saved through grants to
> the K-Mart Corporation. K-Mart will use a $2 million grant to replace old
> lighting fixtures with energy efficient ones in its 85 California stores.
> 
> The demand responsive program and the innovative efficiency and renewables
> program covering the K-Mart grant are parts of AB 970, which was passed
> last year. The bill is designed to reduce at least 220 megawatts of peak
> load by June 1, 2001. 
> 
> The Governor has proposed an additional $70 million in his New Demand
> Reduction Initiative program that would yield an additional 160 megawatts
> in savings from demand responsive building systems. 
> 
> For more information, please contact the California Energy Commission.
> 
> Demand Responsive Contracts:
> 1. Sacramento Municipal Utility District, $882,750, target savings: 10
> megawatts
> 2. Roseville Electric, $956,000, target savings: 10 megawatts 
> 3. Pacific Gas and Electric, $1,411,026, target savings: 35 megawatts
> 4. Seiben Energy Associates, $340,245, target savings: 1.3 megawatts
> 5. Apogee Interactive, Inc., $422,915, target savings: 5 megawatts
> 6. Enron Energy Services Op. Inc. , $1,500,000, target savings: 7.5
> megawatts
> 7. San Diego Regional Energy Office, $1,085,476, target savings: 3.125
> megawatts
> 8. Global Energy Partner, LLC, $1,540,000, target savings: 15 megawatts
> 
> Grants:
> 1. Cisco Systems, $40,460, target savings: 1.2 megawatts
> 2. Alameda County, $260,964, target savings: 1.2 megawatts
> 3. Hewlett Packard, $445,693, target savings: 1.8 megawatts 
> 4. Foothill College District-De Anza, $283,140, target savings: 1.3
