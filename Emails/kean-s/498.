A number of parties protested Entergy's Source and Sink filing at FERC based 
on arguments similar to ours (discriminatory treatment of PTP 
customers/Generation only control areas approved by NERC).  As you can see, 
TDUs and utilities joined in on this.:

Dynegy Power Marketing
Aquila Energy Marketing
Peco Energy Co. 
Municipal Energy Agency of Miss.; Lafayette Utilities System; and the 
Lousiana Energy and Power Authority (who pointed out that Entergy's proposal 
could,  perhaps, only work in a big, regional system and that Entergy had 
left SPP)
Coral Power, ELCON and Enron
VEPCO (who now owns an approved generation only control connected to Entergy 
and TVA.  VEPCO alerts FERC that Entergy already refused transmission with   
a sink at the new control area, even though Entergy asks for a May 22 
effective date.)
Louisiana Energy Users Group
Tenaska Power Services
El Paso Merchant Energy (asks FERC to promote gen. only control areas as 
"hubs" in order to move more toward the gas model)

Finally, ComEd filed comments stating this is an important issue and FERC 
should resolve this before the summer.  ComEd did not take a position on 
whether Entergy's filing was good or bad.  Maybe ComEd's filing will get FERC 
to deny Entergy's request before the summer, rather than setting it for 
hearing!  (There so far are no filings in support of Entergy.)

Let me know if you would like a copy of any of these.
