This Canadian environmental advocacy group filed at FERC a protest of HQ's 
continuation of market based rates (EPMI also filed a protest).  They note:

FERC's traditional Hub and Spoke market power analysis provides "false" 
market share percentages
The Quebec governmental has undermined the Quebec regulator, the Regie, of 
the exclusive jurisdiction in transmission regulation.  They cite an issue 
with 100 km of 735kv lines that were built using "emergency powers" to avoid 
the regulatory process.  In addition, they discuss a 1/99 Directive that 
absolved HQ from providing ionformation to the Regie.  Their conclusion is 
that the Regie is unable to question the prudence or usefulness of 
transmission equipment investments by HQ.  (Full protest attached.)
