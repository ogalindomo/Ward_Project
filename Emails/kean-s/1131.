Sue: Thanks to you too. It was a pleasure having you as a key player on our 
convention team and as a fellow host/hostess at Enron events. We did much 
more at these conventions and the demands were greater because of Enron's 
growing business as well as political interests. Heidi and Carolyn Cooney 
were outstanding. Their experience in organizing our participation and 
satisfying each Enron participant in getting access to events is just short 
of miraculous or maybe just exceeding it.  I was especially pleased that Rick 
participated so actively as well as our other collegues especially the folks 
from Omaha who made the Nebraska events such a success. I know that Heidi 
will appreciate your thanks. To repeat: she and Carolyn deserve some special 
recognition for a superb job, Joe

Heidi--thanks for all of your good work in organizing our participation at 
both the Republican and Democrat conventions.  While I know that you've 
worked with Enron on many events in the past, I recognize the difficulties in 
dealing with some new "cooks in the kitchen" this time around.  Your 
professionalism and courtesies to the first timers in this process, including 
me, is much appreciated.
