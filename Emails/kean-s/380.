Please see the attached email.  Interventions and protests are due on the 
merger application by May 3 (60 days from the day we submitted the 
application (March 3)).  Comments on the joint Open Access tariff are due on 
March 24, but we anticipate more activity on the application rather than the 
tariff.  We'll keep you posted on both proceedings as pleadings are filed 
with FERC.

Please call or email me if you have any questions.
