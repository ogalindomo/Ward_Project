 I talked to our CPUC attorney, Jeanne Bennett.

There is a CPUC tomorrow at which a vote could be taken
It is not on the agenda now, but that doesn't stop a vote
The CPUC could decide by majority vote to take up the issue at the meeting 
and then vote to enact the ban on direct access -- all without any notice to 
the public
We will have a representative at the meeting.
Jeff is contacting coalition members to work the legislative angle.
There is another CPUC meeting on 2/22
