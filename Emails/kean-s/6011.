I know this is a long way off, but I have a great idea for you  for Mother's 
Day (it'll work for Father's Day too).? Get a webcam and  
microphone,?and?download a copy of Microsoft NetMeeting to your  computer.? I 
will see to it that?Mom and Dad will be?similarly  equipped. ?See where I'm 
going with this?? Mom and Dad will be able to  talk to you and see you.? 
They'll love it.??  
?
Let me know what you think.
