Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

Kathy,
Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern 
Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive 
Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian 
activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the 
Executive Committee.
Very truly yours,
Buddy and Eileen Leech
