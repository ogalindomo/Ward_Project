Here are some minor edits.  What's the timing of the release? I can work on 
it a bit more tomorrow on the plane to Houston if that would be useful.

Best,
Jeff

Here is the revised letter.  I changed the last sentence in the 1st paragraph 
to reflect Mike Day's comments.  I guess if it is okay with everyone, we will 
have Mike Day and Sandy come up with a mailing list.
