Enron's proposal (attached to the SERC letter) was not limited to non-firm, 
since we just said "transmission".  TVA has told us by letter and now has 
refused firm requests that list ENSE as the sink.  We may want to think about 
trying to get TVA, through SERC, to agree to let us sink at ENSE on firm, 
based on SERC's acceptance of this compromise (except, per NERC, with the 
right to park more than we had proposed here).  In any event, we should think 
about these issues before responding.  There is no deadline for a quick 
response to the SERC 12/13/99 letter.
