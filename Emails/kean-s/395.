Thanks to all of you who have commented already on earlier versions of the 
attached white paper.  Remember, this is the message we want to use now as we 
are telling various audiences our strategy for the regions.  Please edit on e 
mail and send comments back to me by end of day London time Wednesday if 
possible.  I am en route to Houston on Wednesday.

I am also recruiting Frank Sayre to help me with the Central America section, 
which is weak.

Once I hear from you I'll revise again and send new draft by Thursday.  Who 
should be on the next distribution list besides all of you?
