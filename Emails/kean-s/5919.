Attached is my draft revision to Alan's letter to Sen. Wyden on information 
release.  

I have already spoken to Josh Sheinkman in Sen Wyden's office about this 
issue and promised more detail as well as a face to face meeting with experts 
if necessary.  

Also, Chris Long just got a call from the Senator's office indicatiing that 
he wants to place a call to Skilling to discuss this issue.  Should we 
arrange a time for the call or avoid th emeeting.  I need to call back today.

Tom
