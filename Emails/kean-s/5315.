SBX 1 (Soto) - The windfall profits tax bill passed out of the Senate
Revenue and Taxation Committee on a party-line vote.  Language is
forthcoming, however the bill is missing major components as those have
not been worked out.  The bill is structured to provide a tax rebate to
consumers thereby making it revenue neutral so it only needs a simple
majority vote to pass.
