Steve,

Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.

We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
overall message.

Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.

Thanks,
Dan Marcontell
