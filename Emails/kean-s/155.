Do we really want SERC ADR or should we push for Howard Hawk's NERC group to 
address instead?

Subject: TVA -ENRON dispute--SERC executive Meeting

On Thursday 10/7/99 the SERC executive committee met to discuss the ENRON-TVA 
dispute as directed in Howard Hawks letter.  They will respond officially to 
Howard as early as today.  The results of the meeting as transfered to me 
verbally are that :
 1.   They did not directly discuss the position letters presented by either 
TVA or ENRON.
 2.   The SERC executive committee discussed the process for the next step 
and the recommendation that will be sent  to Howard is that the SERC dispute 
resolution process be utilized to resolve the issue.
 3.   A member group "independent"  will be appointed to implement the ADR 
process with in SERC ASAP.  The   SERC ADR process has not been used 
previously but is is a defined written procedure which, I understand, is   
voluntary.  They are faxing me a copy of the procedure today. 
 4.  ENRON does not and should not take any official action until we get 
Howards letter.  This is a heads up only.
