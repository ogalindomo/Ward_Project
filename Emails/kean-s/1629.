The Grid Florida (nee FLTRANSCO) RTO filing was completed today.  In order
to provide the documents to you more efficiently, we are making them
available for download on the Florida Transco website in a single zipped
file.  Within the file, you will find each of the individual documents
filed with the FERC in Adobe Acrobat format.  The Zip file is available on
the website homepage at: http://www.flatransco.com/  Individual files are
also available by clicking on the Filing Documents button at the same
location.

One of the files (Attachment P) is unusually large. It is only 15 pages
long, but nearly 3.8MB unzipped.  There are graphics in this file, but I
will be looking to see if we can improve the efficiency of this file also.
Please contact me if you have any problems with the files.
