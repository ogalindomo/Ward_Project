Ginger, would you please distribute this e-mail to everyone in Government 
Affairs.  Thanks.
 

As you all know, Enron has been actively participating in an industry-wide 
collaborative effort, working to develop recommended Uniform Business 
Practices (UBP) for Retail Energy Markets.  This effort was in direct 
response to the Coalition for Uniform Business Rules (CUBR) report, which was 
published in September 1999.  THE UBP released Volume 1 of a two-volume final 
report on November 22, 2000.   Volume 1 includes recommend business practices 
for the following topics:  Customer Information, Customer Enrollment & 
Switching, Billing & Payment Processing, Exhibit - Billing Services 
Agreement, Load Profiling, Supplier Licensing, Market Participant 
Interaction( MPI):  Governing Documents and Performance Standards, Exhibit - 
Outline for Master Service Agreement, Disputes Between Utility and the 
Supplier, Customer Inquiries, Exhibit - Customer Account Maintenance and 
Glossary.  Also included in the document is an Introduction and a Preface.  

We would like to promote the use of this UBP report as a key item to be 
included in Enron's advocacy efforts for state restructuring legislation and 
commission implementation proceedings.  This report can be downloaded and 
printed from the following website:  http://www.ubpnet.org/workshop/index.htm
.  If you would prefer to receive a printed copy of this report, please 
e-mail me with your request and we will make the necessary arrangments for 
the report to be printed and distributed.  

Volume 2 which will address unbundled electricity metering will be published 
by year-end 2000.  I will let you know when this portion of the report is 
available.

Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding this 
report or if you would like assistance in promoting the use of the UBP report 
within the various states.  Vinio Floris, who has recently joined our group, 
will also be working with me to promote the use of this report.  Barbara 
Hueter is also devoting time to this project by participating with other 
Suppliers in developing and implementing a consumer outreach program.
