Subject: Summary of Enron's filing in UC/CSU case

Attached is a summary of the Enron's motion in opposition to  UC/CSU's motion 
for an expedited hearing schedule.  The documents will be filed later today 
and circulated to the working group.  Once this filing is made we will turn 
our efforts to preparing our answer to their complaint, and continue 
developing our strategy on the counterclaim. 

Thanks to Bob Williams, Mike Smith,  Evan Hughes,  Jeff Dasovich, Dennis 
Benevides, Peggy Mahoney,and Tom Riley for their efforts in this matter.
