Since it will not be possible to reach Ken Lay before tomorrow, Jim advises 
that the actions will not be taken before Monday morning India time.  In the 
interim, your approval and comments on the attached draft statement/Q&As 
would be appreciated.  I will be out of town until mid-afternoon Sunday, but 
checking e-mails and can be reached on my cellular phone (281-948-7273).

Thanks,

John
