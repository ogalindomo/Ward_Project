Steve - 

I am extremely interested in looking at Enron regulatory/government affairs 
and I would appreciate the chance to talk with you if you have some time this 
week.  I remembered your name from my first stint in EBS Latin America (I 
worked on a few regulatory issues as part of the origination function) and I 
would be interested to hear your thoughts on career opportunities within your 
group as well as anything that I can do from a personal standpoint.  If you 
have some time, please let me know.
