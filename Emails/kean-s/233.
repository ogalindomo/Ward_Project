Attached please find the final executive communications document 
with completed phone numbers for the millennium rollover weekend.

The Y2K Corporate team and all Enron business units will be monitoring 
the Y2K event the day prior to and following the rollover.  

Each Enron major site has developed contingency plans, and every 
Enron location will be contacted for status checks as the century rollover 
occurs.  

We look forward to reporting our Y2K success.
