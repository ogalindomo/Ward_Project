Dear Steve,

Thank you for your call on Friday.  I appreciated the opportunity to speak to 
you openly.  It has been a bumpy ride here in DC since the summer, but the 
turbulence has subsided and our new pilot has brought us to terra firma.

I can't say enough good things about the leadership Linda brings to this 
office.  Compassionate and wise, she's able to sort through mountains of 
information and prioritize.  She's effective at bringing people together and 
our new open office space facilitates better communication.  She hosted a 
happy hour after work on Friday for the entire team and invited some of 
Bracewell's people for good measure.  

It is wise strategy to bring John Hardy and his team into Federal Government 
Affairs.  John's intimate knowledge of our key international projects and his 
astute political skills make him a valuable asset to the team.  He works well 
with Tom Briggs and I believe together they can pull the international issues 
together.

These and other changes are good news for the DC office.  In addition, as 
Chief of Staff I commend you for the much needed changes in our accounting 
system (XMS), the upgrade to our software, and our wonderful new computers.  
A sincere thank you!!

As always, your behind the scenes people -- Maureen, Ginger, Elizabeth 
Linnell and her team -- are supportive and respond quickly to requests.  I 
can't say enough about these highly intelligent, dedicated individuals who 
certainly make my life easier in Washington.

Steve, please feel free to call upon me anytime.  I value your support, as 
ever.

PS --  Linda has obtained West Wing White House tour passes for the Philippe 
Bibi family and has so informed him.

Best regards.

Lora
