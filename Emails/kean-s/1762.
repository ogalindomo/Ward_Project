I just noticed one minor error.  I think that you are trying to highlight 
that Terry Winter, the Chief Executive Officer of the ISO voted against the 
proposal.  In the text, you say the Chairman of the ISO.  There is no 
Chairman of the ISO.  There is a Chairman of the Board of the ISO -- Jan 
Smutney-Jones -- who has consistently voted against the price caps since 
June.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
