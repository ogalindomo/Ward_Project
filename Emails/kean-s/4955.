Yesterday evening, FERC issued an order granting Mirant's complaint against 
the ISO's plans to implement the Circuit Breaker proposal without FERC 
approval.  The Commission said that the ISO must file proposed tariff sheets 
if it wants to implement the Circuit Breaker proposal.

In an Order issued May 9th, the Commission granted Mirant's complaint against 
plans of the NYISO to automate a step in its market mitigation measures to 
eliminate the current one-day delay in mitigating conduct that would 
otherwise set non-competitive market energy prices in the next day's 
Day-Ahead Market (DAM).  The NYISO must file proposed tariff sheets under 
Section 205 if it wishes to implement its modified market mitigation 
procedures.
The Order is attached in "TIFF" format.  If you are unable open it, the Order 
should be posted on FERC's website later today.
