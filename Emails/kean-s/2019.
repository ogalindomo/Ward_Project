HERE are the good parts:

CMUA asks FERC to order quick release of bid and other inf to the market 
participants; cites Australian rules, England & Wales, and Alberta -- 
Miracles do happen!

Opposes 5% deviation band for underschedu;ing -- recommends a fixed band with 
a minimum of 2 MW for "smaller" SCs
As an alternative -- asks for an 8% band. Does not address the pplication to 
generation.


The bad parts:

Thinks the Governor should appoint three of the Board members and the other 
three should be appointed by the WSCC Board of Trustees. (the ISO CEO makes 
the 7th) Wants the Board to report back after 2 years to see how RTOS might 
fit in in CA.

Still wants to return to cost-of-service rates.

Opposes opportunity costs as factor in evaluating bids above $250

Wants costs allocated properly -- in other words re-allocated away from the 
munis.
