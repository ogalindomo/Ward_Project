I just received further info on the status of FERC Commissioners from Dave 
Lugar at QG.  This info is based on his conversations with people close to 
Abraham.  Unfortunately, this came in too late to make it into my memo 
delivered to Ken at 11:45.  According to Dave, DOE sources are saying that 
Pat Wood is the pick for Chair.  However, Wood has told the Bush people that 
he may want to see through dereg in Texas and therefore would not be 
available for about five months.  The White House is thinking about lettting 
Hebert stay on during this period and let Wood come on board late spring or 
summer.  DOE sources also are hearing Nora Brownell's name in the mix.  
Governor Ridge is said to be opposing this selection.  John Quain is in the 
running, and Ridge apparently is supportive.
