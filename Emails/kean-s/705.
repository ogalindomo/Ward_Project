Subject: Summary/translation of article


Steve:

Sorry for the delay but please find attached the translation of the article
as requested.  I would be curious to know when/where this article was
published.  If my guess is correct, it was published at Correio Brasiliense
(main Brasilia newspaper) but not really an  important national newspaper.

Hope you are well.  Kellie and Nelson are looking forward to meeting with
you in Houston Thursday. Let me know if there is anything I can do for you
in the meantime.

Best Regards,
