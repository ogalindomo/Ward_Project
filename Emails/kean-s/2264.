STATEMENT BY WILLIAM DALEY

Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are now reviewing the 5-4 decision issued tonight
by the Supreme Court of the United States.  The decision is both complex and
lengthy.  It will take some time to completely analyze this opinion.  We
will address the Court's decision in full detail at a time to be determined
tomorrow.
