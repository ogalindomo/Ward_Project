Update - we had a good session today to continue to resolve open issues.  One 
thing that resulted is to have a meeting with management to discuss, among 
other things, management's tranfer plan  for the assets, interim operations 
between signing and closing, operating entities that Enron could be deemed to 
control, disputes with EE&CC, and the purchase and sale agreement and the 
related disclosure schedules.  I believe that the meeting is being set up for 
Wednesday.  I can see how it is imperative that the General Counsels be at 
the meeting, although I am sure I do not control the invitation list.  You 
may want to talk to your business heads.  With this schedule, we are to have 
a good set of disclosure schedules by that date.  The latest plan 
contemplates circulation of the revised purchase and sale agreement and draft 
disclosure schedules by Monday night.  Tuesday would be a day for questions 
in advance of Wednesday's meeting.  Attached is a draft of known open issues 
with EE&CC.   Thanks for all the help.  Lance.
