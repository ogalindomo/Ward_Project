The Woodlands, TX here we come!!!!!!  I hope everyone is ready for the next 
Government Affairs - The Americas department meeting.  The meeting is 
scheduled for Thursday, March 30 at 9:00am and should conclude by 4:00pm.  
For those staying over night, I will be putting a rooming list together and 
will need to know your plans for attending this meeting by, Friday, March 3.  
I know this is somewhat short notice but I'd like to get this finalized

greatly appreciated.  The location of the meeting will be:

The Woodlands Resort provides transportation service to and from the 
airport.  The shuttle service operates every hour on the hour from 6:00am - 
10:00pm.   Please let me know what your travel arrangements are and I will 
forward it to the transportation department.  Once I have forwarded all of 
the transportation requests to them, any changes that need to be made will 
need to be made directly with the transportation desk at 281-364-6256.

Attached is a draft agenda for the meeting (Pamela Lesh and Lance Schuler,
