Steve, please accept our condolences for the loss of you father.  The 
Governor and I put family first and in this time our hearts and thoughts are 
with you as a son.  We look forward to meeting with you at another time.  
Paul did a great job and we thank ENRON for having a good strategy and good 
people to manage it.  Stephen Reynolds
