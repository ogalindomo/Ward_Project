Do you have a list of ongoing projects the Southern Cone Gov't Affairs group 
is engaged in?  Please forward to me if you do.( If something does'nt already 
exist, perhaps you could pull something together at your earliest convenience 
) Also, any information as to relative priority of these projects and level 
of resources ( both internal and external ) you have committed by project 
would be helpful. I look forward to getting down to Sao Paulo soon to visit 
with you and your group. Hope your move goes  uneventfully. Thanks for all 
your help.
