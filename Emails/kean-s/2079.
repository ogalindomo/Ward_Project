With the move to RTO configurations, are you interested in seeing this report 
based on electric's RTO affiliations, still listing activity by electric but 
designated under RTO affiliation?  If so, there would no longer be a 
separation between EAST and WEST.  Please advise if you are interested.  (The 
report can remain as is, as you wish).

Attached is the Weekly Electric Report for week ending November 24.
