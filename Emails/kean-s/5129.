Steve, Mark

Please find attached a draft Q&A on our power marketing position in Japan.  I 
thought you might find it useful background in case you meet with John 
Sherriff while he is over in Houston this week.  I understand that John is 
now minded NOT to make an internal announcement about the proposed changes.  
However we will need to make changes to the EJ website and to the standard 
media pack.  Let me know if I can help with anything else.
