Adrian has incorporated my edits, so I send it to you for any FINAL changes 
you recommend.  Please contact Adrian directly--I am leaving town and he is 
anxious to complete this and put it in the public domain.

I'd look carefully at the last 2 1/2 pages on alternatives to price 
caps--state and federal reforms.

If this is turned around tomorrow, have Adrian send it to one of you for 
distribution to Linda Robertson et al. 

Thanks,

- Rob
