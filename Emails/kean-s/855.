Subject: Re: Congestion Management Chart

Ginger:

Would you please forward the attached Congestion Management Comparison chart 
to everyone in Government Affairs.   This chart was recently prepared for us 
by Tabors Caramanis.  

Although the people dealing with wholesale issues will have the most interest 
in the chart, I believe there are others who are also interested in the 
congestion management debate.

Thanks

Sarah
