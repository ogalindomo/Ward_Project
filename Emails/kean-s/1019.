I've made the changes we discussed this afternoon.  I've double checked the 
formulas, but have not yet double checked every number.  Also, to e-mail 
this, I had to convert the table to plain numbers, so we lost the number 
formatting with commas and parentheses around the negatives.  I'll continue 
working on this tomorrow, but it already looks better.
