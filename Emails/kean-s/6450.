Dear Steve --

It was good talking with you before Christmas, and I have been trying to
follow the California power story closely since then.

I would like to propose going ahead with the plan we discussed for a
one-month trial.

Our fee would be $5000.

For this amount, Doug Gamble or I would send you some material twice a week:
a few jokes, anecdotes, or funny reactions to the ongoing story.
Additionally, we will work with a cartoonist the White House Writers Group
works with regularly, and we will try to send you two or three
editorial-type cartoons over the month of January.

To make this work, it would be helpful if you could send Doug and I a daily
email of news clips related to the story, or any article or report you would
like to which you would like to draw our attention.

If this arrangement is acceptable to you, please let me know by email or
phone.

This could be a fun project and I look forward to working with you on it.

Daniel
