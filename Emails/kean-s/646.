Further to my e-mail yesterday, advising of the approval of the GasBol - 
Transborder Firm Transportation Contract for service to Cuiaba, I have 
received letters today from the Superintendent
APPROVING the following firm transportation service contracts:

GTB-Transborder
Transredes-Transborder
Transredes-Chaco
Transredes-Maxus

The approval of the Transborder contracts will be effective 10 days after we 
file an official translation of these contracts.

The approval of the remaining contracts will be effective 10 days after we 
file a signed original of such contracts.

Congratulations to all involved!  Ray
