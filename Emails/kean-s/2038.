     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The western Indian state of
Maharashtra will review its power agreement with Enron Corp.'s
Indian subsidiary after the price of electricity has almost
quadrupled, Associated Press reported.
     The second phase of an agreement with Dhabol Power Co., the
Indian unit of the Houston-based natural-gas and electricity
company, will be reviewed, AP reported, citing Maharashtra's chief
minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh.
     Enron was one of the first big foreign companies to enter
India after the Indian government opened up the economy to foreign
investors in 1991.
