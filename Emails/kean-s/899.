Attached is the latest draft Q&A document, which I've edited and attempted to 
organize into topics.  There are a number of questions that still need 
answers.  I've also attached a draft of the key messages.   Please let me 
know if you have any additions, comments or changes to either document by the 
end of the day Thursday.

Thank you.
Karen
