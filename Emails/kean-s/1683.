Jim,

The pilot RTO Info Database is attached as per your request. Please 
understand that this is a preliminary Draft of the database. 

The database is pretty straightforward. The first page contains a list(with 
links) of the current RTO in the database.
Document links for the talking points/Key issues have been completed for 
DStar, Florida, and Southeastern.
The others will be completed shortly. 

I welcome any suggestions/concerns as I will be changing most of the fields 
of the database on an ongoing basis.

DH

p.s. If you have problems entering text or making changes the password to 
unprotect the workbook is "Achilles"
