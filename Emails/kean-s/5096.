The attached document was transcribed by Maureen McVicker (per Steve's 
request).  It is a summary of Ken's conversation with Speaker Hertzberg last 
evening about the state of California's energy crisis. 

In terms of Ken's meetings in CA next week, a list of individuals that Ken 
will meet with has been finalized.  Ken's office is in the process of 
scheduling those meetings and as soon as the meetings are confirmed I will 
provide everyone with the complete schedule.  

Jeff Dasovich is the point person for pulling together the materials for 
Ken's briefing book, and for coordinating the meeting schedule with Rosalee.  
A prebriefing will take place in Houston between Ken, Steve and Jeff early 
next week.   

If you have any questions about Ken's tour through CA next week, please 
contact Jeff Dasovich directly.
