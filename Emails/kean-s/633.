On 6/2/00, Enron participated in EPSA's comments on FERC's Notice of Interim 
Procedures to Support Industry Reliability Efforts for the summer 
(attached).  On 5/17/00, FERC issued streamlined market based rates filings 
for industrials with on-site generation to sell into the grid, decreased 
approval requirements for utility deals with customers to interrupt load, 
more FERC hotline staff, and better updates of ATC.  In addition to FERC's 
proposals and requests for additional ideas, EPSA commented:
Need robust competitive market to incentivize new generation
Overall big requests--eliminate CBM, require independent ATC calculations, 
require independent Security Coordinators, and native load under same tariff 
Specific suggested fixes for this summer:
 (1) Require transmission providers to give written notice to FERC and post 
within 24 hours of using CBM the specific details of the "emergency"
 (2) Require random FERC OASIS audits of TLRs and ATC 
 (3) Require retention of data confirming system conditions existing at the 
time of a TLR  

FERC has not acted on these comments yet.
