Assemblyman Rod Wright held a meeting today to discuss the following
legislative activities:

Governor Davis has become energized this week and is actively
negotiating with the IOUs.

QF legislation will be heard next week.  The legislation should codify
the payment formula which was developed over the past several weeks
during negotiations between the IOUs and QFs.  The legislation will not
address how the QFs will actually be paid, and it will specify that no
payment will come from the DWR.

Assemblyman Wright hopes to move a stripped down version of ABX 18 next
week to address the IOU under collection.  A sticking point is
determining what type of security the state will take, hydroelectric,
transmission or warrants.  He also intends to hear various interruptable
service measures.

Senator Debra Bowen is scheduled to hear SBX 5, the $1.2 billion dollar
energy efficiency measure, and SBX 33, the California Transmission
Corporation measure.  This is subject to change.
