Rainfall:   2.0 to 4.0 inches, isolated to 7 to 10 inch amounts possible


Discussion:  
There is a fairly good chance of torrential rainfall to redevelop across your 
area during the overnight hours producing hours producing flooding.  The 
surface and upper level low pressure area that is the remnants of Allison 
will drift southwestward during the night and bands of tropical showers and 
thunderstorms are expected to increase across your area overnight, 
particularly during the period between 2 am and 9 pm Friday morning.  Due to 
the excessive amounts of rain that have already fallen, this is potentially a 
very dangerous situation that may develop.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches 
are expected with isolated excessive amounts of 7 to 10 inches possible.  
Occasional to frequent lighting will accompany the stronger storms in the 
downtown area.
