Briefly:

The hearing that was planned to focus on UC issues has been postponed, 
although per the attached there will be a discussion concerning the impact of 
Energy Service Providers turning their customers back to DWR/utility service.


Also, the Federal Judge has scheduled the UC/CSU - Enron Energy Services 
hearing for April 11th.  UC had requested an immediate review versus a 
procedural 35 days to schedule.  The schedule reflects a more procedural 
answer.  

More as we get information.

Subject: Thursday Hearing

Per Sandy, it sounds like there is going to be a budget committee hearing on 
Thursday to discuss DWR procurement and the effect of marketers returning 
customers to utility service.  It looks like we may be asked to provide 
testimony (but not about any customer specific issues).  Mike Day would be 
the right person to provide that testimony if needed.  I'll pass on any more 
details as I get them.  MDS
