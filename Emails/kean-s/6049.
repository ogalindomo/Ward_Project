Paul--I win the bet.  No mention of price caps in the resolution.  And they 
even put a section in under long term strategies to encourage construction of 
a pipeline from Alaska (no big surprise here)  expansion of pipelines and 
expansion of electric transmission lines.  I love these Western guys and 
girls!

I'll send a copy of the resolution via fax.
