Steve, 

John Hardy and I spoke to Kevin Hannon this morning about the status of our 
20k per month retainer with Kissinger and McLarty.  As you are aware, our 
office has suggested that we terminate or severely reduce the retainer.  ken 
lay has kicked the decison over to Rebecca McDonald, who has yet to make a 
decision.  Kevin asked me to send you an email and suggest that the contractv 
be funded by Ken Lay's budget or we terminate.  You may want to atlk to Kevin 
about it, but I think he is eager to get his P&L in shape.

Tom
