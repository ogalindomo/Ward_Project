Subject: Final Trojan Settlement Materials

Attached you'll find the final press materials for the Trojan settlement.
Please not the new "customer savings" number. This is the number CUB wants to
use.This uses 2.6% as the inflation rate the next decade, instead of the 9.6%
that was reflected in the $17.1 million dollar savings. Call me if you have
any questions. Thanks
