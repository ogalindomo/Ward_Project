Just a status check....according to Melanie Kinderdine at DOE both Rich Glick 
and Gary Falley are actually still writing the Order.  Secretary Richardson 
"got out ahead of himself" by announcing the Order before it was drafted.  He 
plans to sign and release it tonight.  Melanie will get it to me when it is 
written and signed tonight.  Richardson felt he had to get the news out 
before tomorrow; thus, why he announced it before it was written.
