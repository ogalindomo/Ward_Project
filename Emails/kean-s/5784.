As you can see from the attached, Stella and John continue to review EES' 
rate curves.  We hope to really get this process fully up to speed with the 
addition of Amr Ibrahim to the group.

		 Subject: IN PSI Curves

PSI's HLFP and HLFS curves plus munis/co-ops were reviewed and attached are 
the summary of the regulatory assumptions.  "Yellow" is initially assigned to 
the curves because of difference in opinion on the transition period 
assumption.



Please let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks!
