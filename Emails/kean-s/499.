Subject: EFSC and NRC Sierra acqusition filings

Jay asked me to give you an update on these - it's as follows:
PGE has filed for NRC approval as an indirect transfer of PGE's licenses for
Trojan.  We have also filed a petition for a declaration ruling that EFSC
approval is not required.

Status:   We anticipate NRC approval by the end of May; no difficulty in
obtaining approval is expected.  NRC has not issued a federal register notice
of it's planned action yet, but we expect that by the beginning of May.   EFSC
will likely decide to grant the petition to issue a declaratory ruling at its
May 19 meeting in Pendleton, and to issue a ruling in our favor at its June
meeting.  We are monitoring both filings.  dn
