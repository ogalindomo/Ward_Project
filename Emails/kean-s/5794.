Subject: one-pagers FINAL

Dave and Ashley:  attached are the final version of the one-pagers.  One of 
the one-pagers is running onto the second page and I think I deleted out one 
of the block headings as well.  Would you mind doing "clean-up" on the 
graphics?  Once clean-up is finished, we're good to go.  Thank you !!  Call 
if you have questions.
