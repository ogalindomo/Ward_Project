Following is a list of the key HR individuals and the V&V task Force members 
identified as having the joint responsibility for insuring the ETC survey 
results are appropriately communicated within their organization by the  
February 15, 2000 target date.  The list was generated with the help of some 
HR groups and Beth Tilney of the V&V task force.  Question marks intidicate 
situations where I was not able to identify the specific V&V representative.  
In order to help facilitate the overall process, Beth has asked that I 
request a brief update from each unit on their progress toward the 2/15 
target date.  She has also asked that you send me a copy of what each unit 
plans to communicate so that I can share that with her.
