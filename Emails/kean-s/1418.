I just spoke to the House Agriculture Committee Senior Staff who told me that 
the House will accept the Commerce Committee language.  The Energy Group has 
been very active in support of the Commerce language because it includes both 
bilateral and multilateral exemptions for all non-agriculture commodities 
(including metals).  This is a siginificant development because the CFTC and 
NYMEX have been opposed to the Commerce language especially as it applies to 
metals and electronic trading.  

The House leadership hopes to have the CEA Reauthorization bill on the floor 
later this week or early next under the suspension calendar (which means that 
the bill could be voice voted without amendment).

Next to the Senate... where the CFTC and NYMEX will be equally vigilant and 
have good relations with Banking Committee Ranking member Harkin.  We plan to 
meet with the interested parties sometime this week at which time we hope to 
debunk the myth that an unregulated OTC energy market could lead (or has led) 
to high oil prices.

More to follow. 

Thanks - Chris
