FYI, the attached press release announcing a fiber exchange is scheduled to 
be issued tomorrow by Qwest, however EBS is not named in the release (due to 
sensitivities with the pending USWest deal).  Under the terms of the 
exchange,  we gave them access on our Denver-to-Dallas route and we received  
New Orleans to Jacksonville via Tallahassee; Jacksonville to Charlotte; and 
Tallahassee to Louisville via Atlanta and Nashville.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

Karen, 
Here's the Qwest release that I just left word on your voicemail about.  
While it doesn't mention Enron, the 1000 mile route spoken to was acquired in 
a fiber exchange with Enron.  Let's discuss. thx,

Kris-
Attached is the latest Qwest release, with the changes I mentioned last
night.  I will call you later to discuss, but the bottom line for us is that
we have to disclose this information in writing prior to our analyst meeting
next week, and Friday is now our only window.  As before, there are no
references to Enron.
Thanks-
Matt
