Here's another good candidate for head of the DC office you guys may want to
sit down with.  Elizabeth Stolpe headed the DC office for Champion
Industries, is highly respected on the Hill and the political community, and
got a golden parachute when International Paper bought Champion.  I have
attached her resume.  (If you can't open this, email me to that effect and
I'll fax this.)

How goes it with Breathed?
