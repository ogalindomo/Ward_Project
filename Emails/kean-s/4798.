I called the Committee lawyers and Andy Black and left a voice mail 
indicating that you wanted to hear Chairman Barton's views on section 102 and 
revenue sharing.

generally acceptable.  The subcommitte print contains the correct pagination

Second Issue:  Linda and I wopuld like you to talk to Sen. Wyden about his

his office to develop transparency legislation.  I'll discuss with you once 
you catch your breath.
