Two additional, minor points:
Nice job of pointing to FERC leadership on 636 under Bush senior.  If memory 
serves, I believe that Bush Sr. also signed the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  
EPAct is arguably one of the most important pieces of energy legislation in a 
generation---might want to allude to it, and signal the need to take the next 
important steps (which are described well in subsequent bullet points) to 
finish the job--which is far from finished.
We (rightly) say price caps are ill-advised, but don't follow with the 
alternative (though the points, when taken together, comprise it).  Might 
want to add a bullet after "price caps are bad" that says something like, 
"The most effective way to lower prices is site and build more generation and 
more transmission and end the ability that tx owners currently have to 
unfairly block the flow of electrons in interstate commerce."

Talking points look great.

Best,
Jeff
