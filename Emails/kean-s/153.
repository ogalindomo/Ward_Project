Ladies and Gentlemen:

Mr. Boston requested the attached letter be distributed to the same group
that Mr. Skilling's August 31st letter to Mr. Gent was distributed. I
believe the entire Board was copied on the August 31 letter; however, if
you didn't receive it or would like a hard copy, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Julie M. Featherston
