Update:  Senator Phil Gramm placed a hold on the S. 2071 late, late last 
evening in order to preserve his options to serve on the Conference with a 
broader House bill version.  The Senate should go out for the July 4th recess 
this evening so consideration of this bill on the Senate floor will be 
deferred until their return the week of July 10th.  Senators Gramm and 
Schumer also intend to introduce their electricity restructuring bill this 
evening.

Subject: S. 2071, Senator Gorton's Reliability bill

Late this afternoon, the Senate "hotlined" S. 2071, Senator Gorton's (R-WA) 
Reliability legislation.   Thus, this bill is likely to  be passed by the 
Senate and referred to the House under unanimous consent late this evening or 
tomorrow at the latest.  This provides a Conference vehicle with the House.  
Senator Gramm intends to hold his PUHCA bill from Senate floor consideration 
until the House acts.

During the week of July 10th, the House plans full Commerce Committee mark-up 
of H.R. 2944, the Subcommittee passed bill, with the exception of striking 
the section 101 Transmission language and replacing it with something along 
the lines of the Chairman Bliley's transmission draft sent to you last 
Friday.  As you recall, Enron opposes the H.R. 2944 Section 101 transmission 
language but supports the Bliley draft language.  Thus, this is a positive 
development.  Drafting continues with Subcommittee Chairman Barton willing to 
accept the Bliley transmission language provided he gains some flexibility in 
terms of a state grievance body and some additional means for state rate 
setting influence.  Perhaps a directed rulemaking would address his concerns. 
 We are deeply involved in the lobbying and drafting of this agreement and 
hope to have late tomorrow a copy of a Bliley/Barton letter sent to all their 
Committee members confirming the agreement to work together to pass 
legislation this year.

Please feel free to call should you need any additional information.
