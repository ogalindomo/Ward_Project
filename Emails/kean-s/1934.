 FYI - Today will be my last full day in the office.  I plan to work at least 
partial days from home until the baby arrives, monitoring e-mail and working 
on a few ongoing projects, and will be reachable at the numbers listed 
below.  Once I head for the hospital I'll change my voicemail to indicate 
that I'm out of service for a while, and will reference the people who will 
be responsible for the various activities in my group.

Home phone:  281-528-6606
Home fax:  281-288-0277
Pager:  888-740-9948
Cell:  713-417-9188

Unless something happens between now and then, I plan to be on Steve's staff 
call on Friday morning at 9:30, and will hold a Info/Admin staff call on 
Friday morning at 11:00.  (Clerical staff don't need to be on that call.)  
(Gus - Please set up this conference call.)

Thanks!
