Subject: Linda Robertson - Offer Talking Points


Rick;

Please find attached the offer talking points for Linda we discussed.  I
have had two conversations with Linda regarding her thoughts on an offer and
I think she will be as flexible as possible.  When you review the document
please remember the "Draft Offer" column contains our suggestions and not
necessarily Linda's specific requests.

I have also had a conversation w/ Delay's office which I would like to share
with you.   Please give me a call to discuss.  Thanks,
