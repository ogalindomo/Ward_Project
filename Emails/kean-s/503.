Steve,

Per your request, I have listed the companies (including the employees) not 
participating in the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).

TGS (Unconsolidated)     Transredes (Unconsolidated)
Daniel Perone (Director)    Javier Pantoja (VP)
       Ray Alvarez (He will be eligible to participate, because he is on the 
expat payroll)


If you have questions or need additional information, let me know.

Thanks.

Arquella
