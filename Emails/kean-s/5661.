Revised (continually being revised) customs risk assessment.  The note will 
help get a handle on the facts.  India is upping the quality/number of legal 
folks assigned to this (praise the Lord).  I will bet, however, that before 
we are through, we may be back to a higher number.  But let's hope not.

Attached is a note on the facts of the Customs issues as I understand them as 
requested by Sandeep Katwala.  Also attached is a draft risk evaluation put 
together by Heidi Hellmann.  Please note that two issues are not yet 
evaluated and thus are not included in the risk evaluation: (i) loading a 
portion of the services agreement to the supply agreement that is 
attributable to power (at a 22.38% duty rate); and (ii) contractor delay 
claims.
