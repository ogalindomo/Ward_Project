Subject: Conference papers

Please find attached an agenda from a conference I attended in Bergen, Norway 
last week.  This was an academic-oriented event at which about 30 papers were 
presented, most of which I have copies of.  There are many papers on, for 
example, aspects of transmission pricing and market power.  Most European 
countries are covered in one way or another, although the Nordic countries, 
Germany and the UK seem to come up most frequently.  Please speak to Merle or 
myself if you want to look at any papers.
