Two different sources have heard that Governor Davis is preparing to
order the CPUC to implement the provision in ABX 1 that would suspend
the authority of parties to enter into direct access contracts.
According to these sources, the intent of the Administration is to place
all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why
each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather
than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for
all parties.
