I attach a draft agenda for the first meeting of the Japan Working Group. I 
will endeavour to phone each of you prior to the meeting to discuss your 
thoughts on the Working Group, including what you want out of your 
participation in the Group. I will be in E Power's office in Tokyo this week 
if you would like to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you and to 
the meeting later this week.
