Attached is a first draft of the GPG rehearing of Order 637.  At this point 
please just review the document for overall tone and to ensure that I 
included all the appropriate points.  I would appreciate this initial 
feedback by noon Friday, March 3.   I will return a second draft by COB on 
Friday and you can may any detailed edits on the second draft.
