In advance of my visit next week, could you please prepare a list of priority 
activities currently underway in your goup( domestic and international ) with 
some sense of the level of  resources being committed to each of those 
activities( internal and external resources ) ?  What might also be helpful 
with respect to each of those activities are short, mid, and long-term 
objectives,e.g,.value creation, that you have identified. Thanks very much. I 
look forward to seeing you all next week.
