Here's my "final" draft incorporating comments from West Trading, Steffes, 
Kaufman (limited, due to time constraints) , Dasovich , and the latest back 
and forth on the level of the cap.

In the end I did not reorganize sections as I thought that would cause to 
much craziness with the lawyers who are trying to x-reference the document.   
Frankly I think the order of the arguments in the affidavit are less 
important than in the pleading.
