Steve:

Here are the talking points and Dan's backup document.  As you can see, both 
documents focus on using the CRT proceeding or the Petition for Rulemaking 
proceeding as the procedural vehicle for FERC to act, but we shouldn't have 
to make too many changes to the talking points to incorporate the new ideas 
we discussed with Adam this morning.

Let me know what you think.
