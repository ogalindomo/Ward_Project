Mr. Kean,

It was good to talk with you last night. Thank you for the presentation and
the food!

I believe that I have the qualities that will benefit Enron. I have strong
quantitative skills, and my experience as a project engineer gives me
experience dealing with people and getting things done on time and under
budget.

I am excited about Enron because I believe that working in a growing and
developing company can help me to grow and develop.

Thank you once again for your presentation and your time with us last night.

Mike Wright
