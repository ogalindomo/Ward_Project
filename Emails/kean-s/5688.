This is an OK bill.  Not well drafted. It's also overly complicated and 
proscriptive.

Deletes the offensive part of ABX 1.
It allows anybody to do whatever they want until June 1 (section 2 d)
On June 1, 
  - res and small commercial customers can get in a cue and get DA up to the 
# of MWs that are added through load growth. (Section 2 e)
  -- Larger customers would pay an exit fee. (section 2 f)
  -- DA customers would be a entrance fee to return to IOU service (Section 2 
g)

There is also a confusing section (2 c) that says a retail customer is only 
stuck with CDWR for the proportion of power that CDWR provides.  The way it 
reads, if CDWR is providing 40% of the IOUs' power, the retail customer can 
get DA for 60% of its load.  I doubt that will fly -- too difficult to keep 
track of and ISO will oppose (only one scheduling coordinator/meter)

A conference call and meeting is scheduled with parties tomorrow on this 
language.

Will keep you apprised.
