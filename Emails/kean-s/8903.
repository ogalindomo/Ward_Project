Here is a draft of Ban Sharma's and Ursula's presentation on what California 
has done wrong.  I think a few people are looking for this info.  Please work 
with Ban to add / change, etc. so we have one document.

Subject: New version

Jim,

We made some grammar  and cosmetic changes... here is the latest version.   
Also, we modified the meaning of bullet three (page 3) and added appendix 1.

Do you want to change the title?



We will wait for your comments.

Ursula
