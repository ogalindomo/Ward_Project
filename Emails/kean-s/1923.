Attached is a summary of FERC Staff=01,s November 1, 2000 report on its=20
investigation of the Northeast region.  The report is very encouraging=20
because it is comprehensive and recommends many of the changes and solution=
s=20
that Enron has been advocating for years.  The report is also encouraging=
=20
because it indicates a significant level of understanding of the northeast=

markets (and the problems in these markets) by the FERC people who worked o=
n=20
this report.  Because this is only a brief summary, the entire report=20
(particularly sections 4 and 5) should be read in detail.  A copy of the=20
report is attached.

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.
