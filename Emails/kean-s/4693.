Steve,

I don't know if you're checking your e-mail while you're out, but I wanted to 
let you know how very sorry John and I were to hear of your loss.   You and 
your family are in our thoughts in these difficult times.  If your dad was 
anything like you, I know he will be greatly missed by many friends and 
acquaintances.

Elizabeth
