The underlying assumptions for the resources are that they return to some 
business as usual amortization of these assets (a 20 to 30 year amortization) 
assuming that none of the generating assets are uneconomic.  Further, it 
assumes non-revenue earning regulatory assets (other than the TRA 
undercollections) are amortized over the next 5 years.
