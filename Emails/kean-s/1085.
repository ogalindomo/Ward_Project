A few months ago I interviewed on the phone Carlos Ibarguen for possible 
opportunties at Enron.  He is very impressive, was pursuing his Masters in 
Public Administration from the London School of Economics, is bilingual, was 
the Embassy Rep for Bolivia in Washington, DC and has consulting experience 
in promoting private  investments in Bolivia.

He is interested in working at Enron and I believe would be an excellent 
candidate for us.  Transredes in Bolivia has begun the interview process with 
him as they are looking for someone to work in External Affairs.
Carlos completes his Masters 9/1 and will then return to Bolivia. He is 
actively interviewing now and has one offer and is anticipating another.

His resume is attached and he will follow up directly with Steve, Jose and 
Mike to further present himself.  Carlos would be interested in being hired 
into the ESA local Associate and Analyst program if the rotations included a 
concentration in Regulatory/Government Affairs as this is his career 
objective.



thanks,
