Network television is developing a "Texas Version" of "Survivor", the
popular TV show...

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston,
San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and Lubbock... driving
a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads:

"I'm for Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns".

The first to complete the round trip is the winner.
