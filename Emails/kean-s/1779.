We will hold a conference call within 1 to 1 1/2 hours after the conclusion 
of the FERC meeting this morning on California.  Joe Hartose and Donna Fulton 
are at the Commission for the meeting, and they are hoping to talk with FERC 
staff after the meeting to get a better idea of the thinking at FERC, so we 
would like to hold off on the conference call until they have these 
discussions.

Therefore, we will send out a follow up email establishing the time and call 
in number once the meeting is over and I have a chance to talk to Joe and 
Donna.

Sarah
