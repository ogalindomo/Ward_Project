The results are in...I've developed the pictures from the 'pub bash' in 
London and this picture takes first prize - no bias intended.  How many pints 
did he have?

On another note, I will be send the photos + negatives via FEDEX today to 
Tracy Ralston's attention.  

Kelly, I've developed a set of doubles, so let me know if you would like to 
see them - there is a great picture of you and Jackie.
