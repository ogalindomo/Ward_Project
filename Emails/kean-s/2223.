Thanks, Chris.  I am both Vice Chair of the NFTC Export Finance Committee and 
Chairing the NFTC/CEE Transition effort on the Finance agencies with Ed Rice

Linda - Asked if we were following the Ex-Im and OPIC policy issues because 
she is seeing all the e-mails from CEE and NFTC on the different activities 
of both organizations.  I told Linda you were the lead on this and all issues 
that deal with the MFAs, and that you served in a leadership role at the 
NFTC.  Please let me know if you need any suport from my side.
