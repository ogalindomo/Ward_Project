Subject: WTO Impact on the Privatization & Liberalization of the Global 
telecommunication markets

Rick,

Here are some articles which examine the ineffectiveness of WTO agreement  
(1997) on the opening up of the telecommunication markets around the world. 
One of the major forthcoming issues is Japan's risk of tbeing aken to the WTO 
over its high access costs in the Japanese domestic market.  
Both the US and EU have been urging the Japanese to bring down the cost or 
face the consequences.  We are still waiting to see what will happen in 
Brussels? Whether the WTO have enough power to enforce its regulations would 
be a major factor in determining the its prowess in the future.  




best regards,
