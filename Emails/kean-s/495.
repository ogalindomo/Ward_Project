Subject:	FIRSTENERGY "DEAL" OUTRAGEOUS



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tuesday, April 18, 2000


FIRSTENERGY "DEAL" OUTRAGES SAFE ENERGY

COLUMBUS-----Safe Energy Communication Council-OHIO issued the following
statement in response to the electricity deregulation settlement
agreement filed by FirstEnergy Corporation at the close of business,
April 17, 2000.

? FirstEnergy Corporation's behind-closed-door deal has resulted in the
most anti-competitive, anti-consumer, anti-environment interpretation
imaginable of SB 3, Ohio's electricity deregulation law, slated to take
effect Jan. 1, 2001.

? FirstEnergy's acknowledgement that the proposed settlement insures they
will receive the entire $8.9 billion ($6.9 billion pre-tax) in so-called
"stranded costs" constitutes ratepayer robbery unprecedented in Ohio
history.

? The willingness of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, the Ohio
Consumers Counsel and others to agree to this covert contract without
public scrutiny of FirstEnergy's numbers is a slap in the face to fair
process.

Safe Energy will continue to pursue public investigation of FirstEnergy's
transition plan and push for the elimination of stranded costs in an
effort to promote real competition in Ohio's electricity market.
