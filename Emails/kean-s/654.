In order to help spread the EnronOnline success story we have created a new 
daily report, which includes slides and statistics for public consumption.  
The information contained in this attachment can be communicated to audiences 
outside the company and should be used to ensure that we present a consistent 
message to the public. Please ensure that this email is distributed to anyone 
in your group who needs to discuss EnronOnline with individuals outside the 
company.

There are a couple of messages, which we like to concentrate on when 
discussing EnronOnline. Please keep the following messages in mind, to be 
used as verbal responses when talking to a customer and the opportunity 
arises:

- EnronOnline is just another way for our customers to do business with us.
- EnronOnline provides price discovery and simple transactions for free.

Please note that this report is not intended to be used as a stand-alone 
presentation, nor that all the information be used in a single presentation 
or customer communication.   If we have missed a specific area, please let us 
know and we will add it for you on a daily basis.
