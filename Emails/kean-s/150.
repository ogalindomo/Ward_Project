I sent the proposal back to SERC at 12:08pm.  Dick Ingersoll will call Jim 
Maughn and is going to try to find Steve Whitley of TVA (who is out of the 
office) to discuss today.

Jim and Steve;
Attached are minor comments on the latest draft that we believe address 
Steve's concerns on Friday.  Also attached are the examples that we would 
like to attach to the agreement.  Dick Ingersoll will call you both today to 
discuss.  Thank you.(Use LAUNCH to view redlined)
