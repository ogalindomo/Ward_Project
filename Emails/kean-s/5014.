ABX 128 (Corbett), which is the Assembly equivalent to SBX 1, will be
heard by the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee on Monday.  The
bill will be substantially rewritten in committee.  According to
Assembly Member Corbett's office, the bill will have some similarities
with SBX 1, presumably the revenue neutral aspect, but will go in a
substantially different direction.  The Committee will not even release
the language to the Senate Committee so its contents are a closely
guarded secret.
