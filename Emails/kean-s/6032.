Attached is a copy of the new floor plan for 47, as well as a list of the 
seating assignments as approved by senior management.  The construction is 
scheduled to be completed on February 9, and we'll be able to effect our 
moves the following Monday, February 12.  

The move paperwork will be handled as one complete request.  You may be 
contacted for your social security number, current location, etc. if we don't 
already have that information.

On another note, a couple of people have voiced complaints about the air 
quality on the 47th floor.  The air filters have been replaced with high 
density, thicker filters which should make a significant improvement.  The 
Facilities group will also perform some additional testing to check our air 
quality.

If you'll be out of the office on Monday and need help getting your desk 
packed, please let Elizabeth know by Thursday, 2/8.  

Please call her at x33896 if you have any questions.
