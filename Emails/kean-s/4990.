SBX 31 (Burton), which is the clean-up legislation to ABX 1 to correct
outstanding bonding issues, was heard on the Assembly floor.  As an
urgency measure, the bill failed passage garnering only one Republican
vote.  The Democrats then removed the urgency clause and passed the bill
which takes effect 90 days after the end of special session.  The bill
must now go back to the Senate for concurrence.
