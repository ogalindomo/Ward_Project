Hi Steve,

It was great meeting with you the other day and I feel like the community 
involvement opportunities we discussed may be a very good fit!  As a 
follow-up to our discussion, I have listed below a few organizations where 
you and your daughters could volunteer together.  I am more than happy to set 
up any meetings or gather additional information.  Regarding the opportunity 
to join the board of Girls, Inc., I will gladly call Phyllis Faykus-Dutton, 
the Executive Director, to set up a meeting between the two of you or simply 
to find out any other details.  Please let me know if I can be of further 
assistance.

Thanks,
Misha
