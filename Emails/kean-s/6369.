		 Subject: Summary of State Treasurer's "State Takeover" Proposal and Proposed 
Conference Call

It might be a good idea to have a conference call to discuss the state 
treasurer's proposal released last Friday.  A summary is attached.  If folks 
agree that a call would be useful, does Noon PST (on Monday) work?

Best,
Jeff
