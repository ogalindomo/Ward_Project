Thank you to everyone who has responded to the Rice MBA Career Reception.  If 
you have not, we need an RSVP by Monday, November 27th. 

It has been brought to my attention that the Rice invitation said that you 
could  bring a guest.  Unfortunately this is not possible for attendees from 
Enron. This will be a working event for us, and we cannot accommodate you and 
a guest.  

It is very important every Rice Team member attend the following event in 
support of Enron, Rice University and Houston.  

Rice University is please to invite you      Thursday, November 30, 2000
and to join us for a special event       6:00 pm - 9:00 pm      
featuring Jeffrey K. Skilling,        Business Attire
President & COO, Enron Corporation,       Enron Bldg. 50th Floor
speaking on MBA Career Opportunities in Texas.
