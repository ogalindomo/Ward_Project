Steve Whitley told Dick Ingersoll yesterday that TVA would implement the NERC 
letter by Monday.  TVA said it was increasing the scheduling deadlines for 
within day multiple hour schedules to 90 minutes ahead for everyone.  Next 
hour would continue to be 30 minutes (which TVA changed to this summer from 
20 min.).  The new tagging deadlines are supposed to be posted on TVA's OASIS 
by Friday.
