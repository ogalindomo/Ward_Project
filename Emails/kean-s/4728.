Subject: Promotion Criteria -

As promised, attached are the promotion criteria that David and team have 
drafted.  Please get comments back to all on list by 6/11.    The decisions 
below were agreed to for mid-year HR PRC:

There will be no Sr. Director roles within HR.  We will not promote any HR 
employees to this title this year.  We will grandfather those that are in 
currently in Sr. Director and VP titles unless peformance dictates otherwise.
Sr. Directors and some VPs will be PRCed with the Directors
We will discuss the Analysts and Associates that were rated 1 or 2 and ensure 
that we are considering Analysts and Associates in our staffing process.


Let me know if I left anything out.  Have a great week
kp
