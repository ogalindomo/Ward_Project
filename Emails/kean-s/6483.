All:  This is what Stoness & Co. has come up with.  It's going to have to be 
changed significantly.  

We've devised an alternative solution that I'll put together, and forward.  

Maureen, would you please print these out and fax to the airport where Steve, 
et al will be landing so that they can look at hard copies when they land?  

I will try to get our solution done and sent to you in the next hour so it 
can also be faxed.  If you have any questions, just give a ring.

Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
