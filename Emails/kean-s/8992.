Leaving voicemail with two comments: 1 ) Demand buydown: establish 
participation threshold of 20 kw...residential inclusion is unnecessary and 
will draw additional fire........2) Eliminating undue discrimination: we 
should make clear that non-discrimination means all uses of transmission 
system subject to FERC's jurisdiction shall be treated in a 
non-discriminatory manner. Thanks.
