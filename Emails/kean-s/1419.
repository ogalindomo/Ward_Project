Subject: ENA's Response to CA-ISO RFB

The California Independent System Operator has issued an RFB (August 24th) 
requesting the development of 3,000 MW of new generation by June 1, 2000.  
ENA's response involved the provision of 681 MW to be online by June 1, 2001 
or June 1, 2002.  Attached is the cover sheet to our response submitted today.



We wanted you to have this in anticipation of questions.
