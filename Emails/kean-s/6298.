=09=09 Subject: ABX 5 / ABX 6

ABX 5 and ABX 6 both passed out of the Assembly this morning.

ABX 5 =01) Regarding ISO/PX governance, passed off of the Assembly floor on
a vote of 60-9.  All 9 =01&no=018 votes were cast by Republicans.  The only
legislator to speak against the bill was Assemblyman Phil Wyman who
objected to the idea of giving Governor Davis the sole authority to
appoint ISO and PX members.

ABX 6 =01) Regarding retention of IOU generation assets, passed off of the
Assembly floor on a vote of 60-10. All 10 =01&no=018 votes were cast by
Republicans.  Three legislators spoke against the bill: Assemblyman John
Campbell, who indicated that he could support the bill if it had a
sunset provision, and Assemblyman Sam Aanestad and Assemblyman Rod
Pacheco, both of whom objected to the idea of giving the CPUC more
authority.  Assemblyman Aanestad indicated that he does not believe
deregulation is the cause of our current situation, but rather, previous
decisions by the CPUC.
