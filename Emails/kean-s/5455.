Attached is a draft declaration of Dennis Benevides to be filed with our 
brief in the UCCSU case tomorrow.  It contains in red some of my comments to 
the initial draft written by outside counsel.  We are asking Dennis to make 
certain comments about our hedging strategy and CTC exposure in support of 
our case, and I want to make sure you are comfortable with how this reads.  
We have tried to be very general and consistent with our prior message.  

Since we have to file tomorrow, if you could send me any comments you have by 
mid afternoon, that would be great.  Thanks.  MDS

Subject: Dennis' Declaration

Please review my comments, attached.  I discussed this matter with our 
outside counsel, and it is his belief that, since Dennis is testifying on 
personal knowledge to rebut the Universities' specualtion about our "windfall 
profits,"  we do not need all of the specific info about amounts of losses 
and exposure, but can be more general.  I have attempted to address that with 
the attached changes, which I hope will be easier for everyone to get 
comfortable with. 

Once we get this where we like it, I am going to walk it around to Dan and 
others on the commercial side to make sure everyone is comfortable.  Peggy, I 
will leave PR and IR to you.
