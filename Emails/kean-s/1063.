To simplify, for the trading floor, the biggest California issues EPMI  is 
currently pursuing at FERC are:

Beneficial resolution to Price Caps
Access to all market information - "more, better, faster"
Path 15 - control by the ISO not PG&E

However, Tim has numerous other concerns and I'm sure Dennis, Chris and Dave 
do as well.  Accordingly, Tim would like to meet to discuss how we should 
address these concerns and to develop a better understanding of  some of the 
items listed below and the relative priority of these items.  I'd like to 
propose that this meeting happen in Portland.  Shall I set this up?  Please 
forward this to others you think should be involved.

Subject: California Activities - UPDATE

Because so much is going on in California, I thought it would be important to 
draft up a list of current activities that Enron is active in or monitoring 
to make sure that everyone knows what is happening.  The following list of 
issues may not include everything.  If I've left something off that needs 
attention or someone is working on, please add it to the list.  

Thanks.

Jim
