Mr. Kean:

I assume that you have received my letter and enclosed information of
November 14.

If that material prompted any questions, I will answer them promptly.

I hope that with your continuing involvement that we can fund some of these
scholarships through the generosity of Enron executives such as yourself.

Thanks for your continuing interest.

C.MacDowell
