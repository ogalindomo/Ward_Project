Attached is the memo that has been prepared for Enron by Frontier Economics 
outlining Frontier's observations relating to why the proposed rule changes 
are ill advised.  I will provide this document to the 7 member committee of 
industry stakeholders the Power Pool has assembled (Enmax, Atco, TransAlta, 
Enron, SPPA, WattEx, and CalPX) to receive feedback on its proposed rule 
changes.  The first meeting of this committee is tomorrow afternoon.  I will 
also provide the memo to the Alberta Government.  

As part of our action plan we are also in the process of working with Seabron 
Adamson of Frontier Economics and my colleagues in the Government Affairs 
Group to put together a document that outlines the negative and unforseen 
impacts in other jurisdictions of significant changes in rules or market 
design that have been made and that are similar to the changes proposed in 
Alberta.   This document will be provided to the Alberta Government officials 
and the Power Pool at upcoming meetings that we are attempting to arrange.
