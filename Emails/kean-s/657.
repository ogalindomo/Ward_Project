Subject: Nigerian Barge Project

Hi Steve,

The Nigerian barge project is back on course. We have reached definitive 
agreement with the various stakeholders in the Nigerian government without 
giving up much. Right now things look very good and we are looking to have 
the LC signed by next week.

Regards,
Gloria.
