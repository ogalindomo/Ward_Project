Mr. Hawks--As requested by Mr. Skilling, I am sending to you the examples 
that Enron included in its October 6 letter to you (with several words added 
to fully explain the 2000 MW example).  As explained in the discussion in the 
October 6 letter, Enron would like to ensure that NERC's response 
specifically addresses the types of transactions included in these examples 
in order to avoid implementation problems and suggests including examples in 
your decision.  Thank you.  Christi Nicolay 713-853-7007
