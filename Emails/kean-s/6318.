Attached are the pages that we wanted to review with you today.  They cover
design parameters on the investment vehicle, a number of critical open
issues, and next steps on implementing the partnership model.  Please feel
free to call me anytime.  I'm in the office today.  713 751-4390.  I can be
reached on my cell phone this weekend.  713 628-7342.

I don't know what your agenda is for the offsite, but to the extent that
you need something pulled together, please don't hesitate to ask.  I'll be
travelling on Monday, but reachable via cell or voicemail.
