Great stuff. Lets chat in San Antonio. You owe me a beer anyway!

We have been playing with several "commercialisation of HR" ideas including 
setting up our own recruitment search company to market talent we don't 
need/like that passes through the machine (plus unsuccessful redeployment 
people). Idea of developing our own Monster board in connection with this is 
very appealing (Europe already have a site which does some of what we need 
"EnronCareers.Com"). If we can do something with our existing ad strategy 
without adding too much cost that would be outstanding.

Great idea.  

Problems with tagging on to existing commercials, though.  In a thirty second 
spot, every second counts.  The tag as proposed would eat up almost half the 
spot.  I'll set aside the usual blather about the spots just being for brand 
development, corporate image, etc.  

We may want to look into producing a specific recruiting spot.  That would be 
an interesting proposition.  If the idea has commercial merit, we could find 
a way to fund it.  Also, EBS has a new unit called Enron Media Services that 
might be able to help us source the media inventory (need to be a specific 
target) to run the spot.

What do you think?
