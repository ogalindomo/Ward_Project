I wrote the "New Business Idea" email in HTML and apparently the formatting
was lost when it was sent to most of you...making it impossible to read.  I
have saved it in a PDF format along with an article I found funny
(referenced in the email message).

After you read the message, you may think that I've lost my mind.  I am
accepting investors, though.
