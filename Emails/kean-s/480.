Steve, 

Thank you for taking my call and your subsequent offer of assistance on 
Thursday. I wanted to contact you again to confirm you have received my fax 
and see if you had any questions. 

I will be back in Houston on Monday and will be available to visit with you 
or your designee. I look forward to talking with you and I thank you again 
for your friendship and your offer of support.
