Looks good.  Is the co2 reduction only 10.5 tons or is it some multiple, like 
10.5 thousand tons?

		 Subject: Macerich

In response to your TCV question - it is about $280 million, but
Macerich does not want the number released publically.  Also,
below is the final draft which reflects changes from the group.
We are hoping to release by 9am central time today - Thursday.  
Still waiting on one person from Macerich.

Thanks!
Peggy
