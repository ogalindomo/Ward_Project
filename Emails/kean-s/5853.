I am calling Ken Lay's office this afternoon to request that he speak to Andy 
Card about lining up Vice President Cheney as the  dinner speaker on the 21.  
So far this task has been in Sprint's hands.   Because this is not nailed 
down, Phil Cassidy today asked that Ken put in a call to Card.  FYI
