Mr. Kean,

As we discussed on the telephone this morning, I would like to forward my
resume to you because I believe that you will be interested in reviewing my
resume.

I believe that I have the qualities that will benefit Enron. I have strong
quantitative skills, and my experience as a project engineer gives me
experience dealing with people and getting things done on time and under
budget.

I am excited about Enron because I believe that working in a growing and
developing company can help me to grow and develop.

Thank you for forwarding this and I hope to hear from you soon.

Mike Wright
