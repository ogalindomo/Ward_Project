Got Goodin mcbride going over to the court house in S.F. to try and get a 
copy.  Got a call in to Steve Kline of PG&E, but doubt under the 
circumstances that he'll be getting back to me soon.  Soon as I get the copy, 
I'll distribute.

SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) - PG&E Corp.'s utility unit filed for voluntary 
bankruptcy Friday.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. had run up billions of dollars in debt on the spot 
wholesale electricity market. 

The filing came a day after California Gov. Gray Davis reluctantly agreed to 
rate hikes for the state's cash-strapped utilities.

The filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of 
California in San Francisco.

Shares of PG&E Corp. (PCG: news, msgs, alerts) , parent of Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. were halted prior to the announcement. The stock fell 2 cents to 
$11.36 before the halt.

Shares of Edison International (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) , the parent of 
Southern California Edison, another beleaguered California utility, plunged 
20 percent to $10.05 a share.
