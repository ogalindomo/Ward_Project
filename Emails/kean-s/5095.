Below is an outline of the materials that each of you are responsible for 
developing for Ken's briefing book.  Please have the latest  draft of 
materials to me by Friday at 3:00 pm.  I will be giving Steve Kean a draft 
briefing book at that time so that he can review it over the weekend.  We'll 
have feedback to people by Monday morning and can finalize the book by Monday 
evening.
