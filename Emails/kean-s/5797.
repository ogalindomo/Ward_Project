As promised yesterday, attached is my resume and the link to the FX and 
Sovereign Risk group's website.  I have also enclosed a list of the projects 
that I have recently completed.  In addition the projects, I have attached an 
inventory of the  curves that I have produced for corporate-wide deal 
assessment.  I produced 483 curves last year for 58 countries, each curve 
requires a full country risk analysis including a macro-economic policy 
analysis, balance of payments analysis, and political risk analysis.  I look 
forward to continuing to provide you with economic analysis in the future.

I hope to see you in two months.
