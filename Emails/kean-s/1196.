Good point, that is something that I need to clarify.  Before you were able 
to join, J.D. said that their clear preference was LNP but were willing to 
look at other options.

Thane, I thought JD said that PJM did not have a clear preference for LMP and 
was open to other ideas.

Subject: Allstom Esca Call Summary

For those of you who were unable to participate in the call here is a brief 
summary of the next steps.

Esca will put together a summary of additional issues and thoughts on the 
progression of the markets that I will distribute to you when it is received.

Esca received permission from PJM to disclose their name as the party that 
may be interested in staffing/operation of a market if there is not a ready 
or logical candidate to do so.  In addition, there was some interest 
expressed in being the flagship member of the team, subject to Enron's wishes 
and what other companies may participate in the group.  PJM still has a clear 
preference for LNP.

I am in the process putting together a second meeting to finalize what we 
want to see in the markets and whether to incorporate the Esca comments.  
Also, any possible overlaps in products and services would be discussed and 
who would be the best candidates to participate i.e. PJM, APX, CALPX, or 
others.
