Forwarded at the request of Joe Hillings:

David: Thanks for the return. Notes of the meeting will be taken and 
dispatched. I will also send a copy of your response to the other members of 
the Enron WTO Working Group as a fine example of assistance. I think the 
meeting of the working group will be to supply general information however, 
we will send you the call-in number should you find it convenient to 
participate. Best wishes. Joe Hillings

1.   I am glad to be on the group.   However, I will be in Singapore Jan 13/14
during your Houston meeting.   I can perhaps call in for part of the time on 
Friday the 14th
from Singapore ( I will be offsite at a company event).   Please include me 
when 
you give out the call-in number. 

2.   What I can do:   You asked for us to think about associations we could
get involved in this.   There are several.  I have been asked to form an 
energy
committee of the Singapore American Chamber of Commerce.   We hope several
US energy companies will join.  The committee will cover all of SE Asia.   So
I could vet this survey and whole ESC concept with them  if you like.    Same
goes for AmCham Thailand and AM Cham Singapore.

3.   The survey.   I have tried my hand at a notional (quick and dirty) 
response
to the survey.   It is attached for openers but it is incomplete.   A full 
professional
response on all the legal/commercial barriers would require me to pass it by 
regulatory affairs, lawyers, commercial, etc. for our region.  Do we need 
that?
