SDG&E also said yesterday that it received "several" proposals from power
companies to provide fixed future prices for electricity, which involve
long-term contracts touted by power companies -- a "market solution" to the
rate roller coaster residents have experienced.

The utility declined to provide a precise number of proposal details but
said it would evaluate the offers over the next two weeks and make
recommendations to regulatory authorities. Peace said earlier that Enron is
expected to be a bidder, offering a fixed price about 50 percent above
rates of last May.
