Steve:  We need you to have a word with Senator Wyden about the transparency 
legislation that I worked on with his office.  The bill is designed to 
require transmission companies and generators to release operating data on a 
real time basis.  Unfortunately, comments by Senator Wyden made at the FERC 
nominee hearing left the impression that he is gunning for evil marketers, 
including Enron.  Most importantly, that impression was left with McLane 
Layton of Sen Nickles office who has been asked to support the bill.  Wyden 
claims he was "misquoted". 

 Nonetheless, impress upon him that Enron is sticking its neck out on the 
bill because other marketers and generators do not necessarily agree that 
more information should be disclosed and that we are not eagre to lend our 
support if this is going to be turned against us.

I have attached the bill language (it has not been introduced).
