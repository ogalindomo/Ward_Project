Just a quick note, since it is conveniently summarised below, for you to see 
the various import/export authorisations (to/from Spain, hence the reference 
to Pool) Alfredo Huertas has secured for the commercial teams (Iberia, plus 
France).   mcs

Subject: Additional import/export authorisation

Please, find attached .tif file containing the authorisation to our new 
import/export requests:





As you could see in the attachment, the DGPEyM has made a mistake regarding 
the import authorisation from Portugal. It is not clear if number 9 above is 
50 MW or 200MW, or if 8+9 cannot be more than 200 MW. David is checking with 
the DGPEyM the reason for this.

David will be sending to DGPEyE and OMEL and REE the non-economic conditions 
of the transactions, using the same templates as in the past. 

Pedro, could you start contacting emilio cortes and ree to anticipate them 
the contents of the new authorisations?
