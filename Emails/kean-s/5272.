The attachment includes the list of environmental companies provided to me, 
and companies with "enviro" in the name.  The total spend equals $40,817,587. 
 You may find the separate business units spend under each company line.
I included "other companies" in a separate tab for your observation.  These 
companies may have similiar names (ex.  agra and agra earth & 
environmental).  Please advise.  This involves an extra $3 M.
In another separate tab, are companies that I could not find.  Please let me 
know if you have any more information on these companies.  

Please call if you have any questions.
Thank you.


Best regards,
