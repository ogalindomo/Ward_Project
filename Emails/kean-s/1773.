Subject: PRC Stuff

Here's my effort to respond to the PRC discussion we had in Kohler.  

The criteria for evaluating folks is at the end of the presentation ... but I 
took the liberty to go a bit further and comprehensively address the PRC 
process.    Hope I didn't overstep my bounds ....

I'm around today, as well as Monday (ENA meeting most of the day) and 
Tuesday, but then traveling in Reno, Las Vegas and San Francisco for the 
remainder of the week.   I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the reasoning 
and rationale behind the document.  

As I said on my voice mail, I circulated the document to the attendees at 
Kohler (with the exception of Sue L. and Linda R.).  I've had feedback from a 
number of the attendees, but I can't call it a consensus document.

As always, thanks for the opportunity to make suggestions like this.
