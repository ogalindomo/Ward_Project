SBX 6 (Burton), which would establish a Public Power Authority, passed
out of the Assembly moments ago on a vote of 47 to 8.  The bill must now
go back to the Senate for concurrence.  I have attached the latest
version of the bill for your review.  Three amendments were taken on the
Assembly floor; (1) provide that PPA power utilized in California be
sold at cost based rates, (2) provide that the PPA can also construct
natural gas storage and transmission facilities, and (3) provide that
the state can site on public land, then auction the plans to developers.
