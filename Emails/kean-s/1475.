Subject: Message Points and Backgrounder

Sam tells me (confirmed by Sierra) that the Governor is expected to make an 
announcement about the market opening date, etc.,, by this Wednesday.   Can 
we get Ken Lay to make a call early this week?

I've attached some message points and a backgrounder.    Page me if you need 
to chat.
