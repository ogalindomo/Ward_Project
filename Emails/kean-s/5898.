This Week

All:
It is my understanding, from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov
will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend
all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts.  The premise
with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously
suspend everyone's right to bilateral contracts quickly, it sets up a
barrier which the direct access coalition must break through.  In other
words the table is set.  Deal your meal from where the dishes are located.
I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in
the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the
exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how
direct access should work for all parties.  It clearly gives the Admin a
very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur
without having to say that they oppose direct access.  Power be where power
lies.
