To all:

We will fly into Dubuque Friday April 20th and stay overnight.  We are going
to a wedding on the 21st in Minneapolis and will return to Dubuque on Sunday
the 22nd.  We will then be in Dubuque until Wednesday the 25th (we fly out
late on the 25th).  Hope to see you all, but we'll settle for some.

We already have our first wild fire of the season.  It was yet another
controlled burn that got out of control near Ruidoso - quite a distance from
here.  45 mile per hour winds are expected for tomorrow.  New Mexico burnin'
again.  Good luck to us all.  Diane and I have appointments set up with two
insurance agents in order to evaluate our insurance coverage.

Take care.

Rob
