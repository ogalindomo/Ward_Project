Jane: Ditto on the views Wade expressed. On the MSEB front, I would like to 
ensure that you are personally making sure that the MSEB review petition 
final form goes in with ur full consent. Enlist Kohli or Gurunath's help in 
this.

Jane,

I know your schedule is very busy, as is mine. This means we don't get to 
talk much and catch up. I just want you to know that we really appreciate 
your help on the many fronts you are fighting, including MSEB/MERC, Metgas, 
LNG shipping policy, Electricity Act 2000, Derivatives trading, etc. It is a 
great comfort to know that we have someone dedicated to this function who 
brings so much personal history and knowledge as well as access to the larger 
Enron regulatory family.

I get very positive feedback from all who interact with you, both internally 
and externally. Keep up the good work.

Wade
