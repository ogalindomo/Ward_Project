=09=09 Subject: Non-core state monitoring

Enron has hired the firm of Stateside Associates to provide State Legislati=
ve=20
Monitoring and Regulatory Forecasting services on those states that aren=01=
,t=20
currently being actively monitored by the department. Stateside Associates =
is=20
based in Arlington, Virginia and is the largest state and local issue=20
management firm.  It has 50 employees and over 13 years of experience=20
providing high quality information resources.  The professionals who monito=
r=20
state legislation are all former state legislative staff members and=20
Regulatory Forecasting is provided by attorneys familiar with our issues.

We will receive an updated Legislative and Regulatory report every two=20
weeks.  Everyone on the attached notification list will receive an email=20
alerting us that the report has been updated.  If you're not on the list an=
d=20
would like to be added please let me know.  The list is currently set up=20
geographically, but we can add an issue-based distribution if needed.

At any time, we can access our report by clicking=20
www.stateside.com/istatelink or by following the site link from the Gov't=
=20
Affairs intranet site.  The Enron logon is phoenix06 (not case sensitive). =
=20
This logon must not to be shared outside Enron. =20

We will also receive email alerts about our issues.  These will be sent to=
=20
the designated recipients based on the issue or geography. =20

Because interaction with us is very important to Stateside, any Enron=20
employee may contact Stateside Associates for additional information (Speci=
al=20
Request) pertinent to the monitoring service.  For example, you may want to=
=20
learn more about who is lobbying for a bill, what the deadlines are for a=
=20
regulatory activity or to receive a list of who testified at a hearing.  Th=

follow-up research is part of the Stateside Associates=01, service.  It wil=

result in any additional fees.

However, if a Special Request is made that is outside the scope of the Enro=
n=20
program,  it will be addressed with me prior to the commencement of any=20
work.  Again, if Stateside responds to your request, there will be no=20
additional fee =01) so please use this feature.
