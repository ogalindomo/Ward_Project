Here is my PR plan, with a few more additions from yesterday.  The team has 
agreed that I can hire Fleishman Hillard in Miami immediately.  We use them 
quite a bit and they have a Latin America practice.  So right now they can 
help me from that office, which will ensure confidentiality.  If we deem 
appropriate or necessary, when we get closer to the date they can bring in 
teams from some of the countries where we need assistance.
