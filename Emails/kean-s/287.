I talked to Schroeder: two items:

 He will call Merrill and explain things but he jest appears to be to find 
out what David wants to do and maybe explore  EBS broad band strategies in 
Singapore.  Isn't Sanjay Bhatnagar running EBS Singapore? I will also give 
Chris Hunt a heads up that Mark will talk to David first.

 Things are straightened out- Grimes and I will meet with Schroeder's people 
Thursday and spend most of the time on Japan and the rest on Korea.
