Here are 4 of the five legislative proposals our office has been asked to
draft.  The only one missing is no. 4, the expedited generation siting
proposal, which will have to be worked on more as we have just received
extensive comments from ENA and outside counsel (McCutchen).  By separate
cover, I will send Jeff Dasovich the summary letter desribing the proposals.
If changes are required, please contact Brian Cragg of our office.
