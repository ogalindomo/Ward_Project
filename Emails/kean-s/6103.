Attached is our brief protest of the merger asking FERC to condition approval 
on FPL and Entergy joining viable RTOs that include a real time energy market 
and transmission type/congestion hedging tools (we cite to our previously 
filed protests of Entergy and FPL's market based rates).  We also ask that a 
grid operator (MISO or PJM) be established over the entities to the extent 
that they are not in a viable fully functioning RTO by the merger approval 
date.   We also reserve our right to file additional data on problems with 
the merger, if necessary.
