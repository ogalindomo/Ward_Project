Steve,

Below is an analysis of 125 EBS employees listed for redeployment.  The final 
number is still predicted to be around 140, but the information reflects all 
the names received for this process to date.  We are continuing to get names 
in on a daily basis and do feel the 140 number will be about right.

Kriste Sullivan, in Corp. Legal said the risk looks low for age or any other 
discrimination claims based on the analysis completed.

We will update this information as we add names, but wanted you to have this 
initial summary.
