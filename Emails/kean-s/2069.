John sherriff and I hosted Ian Murray for an hour today at his request.  He 
will be arriving in Houston in January, having just completed a tour of duty 
in Sao Paolo, where he came into contact with Jim Bannantine.  At the end of 
the meeting I gave him your name/number as a contact.  He may call you.  No 
big issues, he just wants to make sure he knows us, and we know him, as we 
are a major inward investor in the UK.   thanks  mcs
