In preparation for our conference call on Monday, attached are two memos 
prepared by Sam Behrends regarding possible timing of the merger.  We asked 
Sam to prepare these memos to help Paul in his negotiations with TANC and 
SMUD.

We'll talk to everyone on Monday.  If you need to reach me this weekend, my 
number is (301) 320-5721.
