Steve - So far all that's been posted is the Amaren RTO order.  I've attached 
it below as a text file.   I'm also overnighting a copy of it to you, along 
with the charts we discussed.  We'll check for the other orders first thing 
in the morning and send them to you if they've been posted.

Also, Bob Frank gave me a copy of the Judge's recommendation to send to you, 
and the text file for that is attached below.

Talk to you later,
Elizabeth
