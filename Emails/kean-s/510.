Hi Steve,

At our last meeting we discussed having a few Enron people meet with Chuck
Henry, Rice Librarian and Associate Provost, to discuss Enron Broadband and
possible collaborations with Rice and the new International University
Bremen. I know Traci Warner needs to be involved from Enron, but could you
let me know who else so I can try to get everyone together?

Thanks,

Catherine
