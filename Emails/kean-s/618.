Subject: Re: ITC  

Dear Steve, 

I attach a draft paper for the purposes of Steve's presention and subsequent 
submission to the ITC which address reforms in the Australian electricity 
sector. 

As you are probably aware, Enron Australia does not operate in the New 
Zealand market and so the above report does not cover NZ as we are not really 
in a position to provide useful comment on that market.  However, I was able 
to locate a NZ Ministerial inquiry into the electricity industry which, if 
Steve chooses to comment on NZ, may be of use to you.  A copy of that report 
is attached.


Regards,
Rob.
