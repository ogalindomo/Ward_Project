Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan.  See Section 
5 - A Japanese Pool.  They make several good arguments as to why a mandatory 
pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for Japanese 
liberalization.   Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US policy arguments.

Jim - this is what we discussed in Houston last week, i.e., a proposal for a 
market in Japan.  Any thoughts would be appreciated, I am sure, by Mark 
Crowther and Nick O'Day.   thanks  mcs

Mark: please find attached the new draft. As we  discussed this morning, we 
still need to add some details (cites etc) that you  will send us, and also 
add additional local examples which you will  identify.
?
I would like to spend a few more hours going over  the appendices, so will 
send them to you on Monday. Look forward to getting your  thoughts, and 
hopefully to seeing you over here in April.
Regards,
Boaz
