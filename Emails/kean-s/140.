Attached is an update on the referenced matter.  Please call me if you have 
any questions, comments, or suggestions.  Steve Kean, you may want to mention 
this to Ken Lay, since he was involved in this very early on (a meeting with 
Mayor Lanier probably in 1996 or so), and may be involved again.  Feel free 
to forward this memo to others who may be interested.
