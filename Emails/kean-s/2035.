Mark,

Mika Watanabe from my group met with the consulate in Houston a while back. 
The Consul general was undertaking preliminary soundings when they met with 
you in Houston. Mika expressed our in principle interest in sponsoring a 
Japanese cultural event in Houston. The consulate will contact us here in 
Japan when a specific opportunity arises.

kind regards

Steve - where did we ever get to in terms of responding to the Consul General 
about sponsorship?  I came across his name in my files, and just wanted to 
make sure that we had done the courtesy of closing the loop/closing this 
out.   thanks  mcs
