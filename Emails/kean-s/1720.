Enron Offers to Lend $275 Mln to Take Azurix Unit Private

     Houston, Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, offered to provide $275 million in
financing to take Azurix Corp., its struggling water affiliate,
private.
     The proposal would let Azurix buy back shares from private
investors at $7 apiece, a 96 percent premium to yesterday's
closing prices for the Houston-based company, Enron said.
     Azurix would buy back one-third of company. Enron already
owns a third of the water company it created two years ago, and
controls another third through an investor group called Atlantic
Water Trust.
     Azurix shares have fallen more than 80 percent since Enron
took the company public last year as part of a plan to exploit an
expected boom in water treatment projects worldwide.
     Rebecca Mark, once considered in line for the chief
executive's post at Enron, resigned in August as Azurix's chairman
and chief executive because of the company's poor performance.
     Shares of Azurix halted trading at $3.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange today. They've fallen from a high of $23.88 in July
1999. The company now has a market capitalization of $462 million.
    Shares of Houston-based Enron rose 88 cents to $77.38 in early
afternoon trading.
