Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press 
conference.

They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an 
expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. 

Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be 
included:

The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably 
commercial customers in SDG&E
The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential.
The cap will be in place until the end of 2002
There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  

Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive 
director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. 

Any comments as to the bill cap proposal?
