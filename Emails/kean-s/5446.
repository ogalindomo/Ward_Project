Steve: 
Pete van de Gohm asked me to send these presentation slides along to you, as 
a follow up, I believe, of  your recent conversation w/ him. 
The presentation is one I developed at the request of GSS, and have 
delivered, to date, to a group there, and to the EES general audience. It's 
entitled:
Coming Full Circle: A Plausible Future for Power Generation. In it, I lay 
evidence that supports a coming change in the overall model for power 
generation.  
I'd be happy to send more detail (presentation text) if you're so interested.
Regards,
Amy
