Attached are the 58 questions prepared by GPC in anticipation of a public 
release on Project Stanley.  The answers have been compiled by numerous 
individuals, including Aleck, Rob, Kevin Wellenius and me.  Please review, 
make changes and return to me at your earliest convenience.  I will compile 
everyone's corrections, additions, etc. and prepare a revised document.  
Thanks.

If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.
