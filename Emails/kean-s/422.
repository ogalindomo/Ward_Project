Dear Mr. Roark,

Please make reference to your email of March 21, to which were attached
descriptions of some regulations governing certain of Enron's Brazilian
projects, for our revision.

As agreed in  our telephone conversation of yesterday, we limited our
revision to the descriptions of "Brazil - Strategic Overview of Natural Gas
Distribution"; "CEG/RIOG?S";  "GASPART" and  "ELEKTRO".

The above descriptions are attached hereto, marked to show our suggestions.

Please do not hesitate to contact us should you need any clarification.

Best regards,

Maria Elisa Gualandi Verri
