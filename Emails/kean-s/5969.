		 Subject: AReM: Angelides News Conf

AReM Team:
The following is an overview from:

9 a.m., SACRAMENTO _ State Treasurer Phil Angelides
holds media briefing to discuss issuance of energy-related bonds, 915
Capitol
Mall, room 110. Contact: Colleen Beamish, 916-653-4052.

While we have not had time to analyze or digest in detail, here is what
Angelides said:

Angelides: Laid out what needs to be done for the Treasurer's office to
implement AB 1X and what is and isn't appropriate role of the state for
getting the IOUs solvent. 

Angelides: "These will be largest (amount of) municipal bonds issued in
nation's history."

Angelides: Estimated bonds would be in $10 billion range. (This echoes what
he said in Jan. 5 news conference)

Angelides: Goal is to arrange short-term external financing by beginning of
March. This would account for about $2 billion. If they don't get that
amount by March 1, 2001, the State will tap into the General Fund.   (NOTE:
This appears to be different from the $2 billion he talked about last month
for the renewable energy and conservation load program -- the reserve fund
he would use to reduce the intereset paid to the consumers.)

Angelides: It is "fortunate" that this is happening when State of California
currently has a $5.8 billion surplus.

Angelides: By passing AB 1X, the State has "provided for stability on a
going forward basis" for the utilities.

Angelides: "The next step is for the utilities." -- i.e. - the ball is in
their court because the IOUs aren't now in a position where they necessarily
are going to be insolvent, so they have decisions to make. Do they want to
sell off transmission assets or do they want to pursue the bankruptcy
option?

Angelides: "A buyout, not a bailout makes sense." because it "would give
liquidity to the utilities."

Angelides: Announced he was assembling full financing team which would be in
place by Friday. 

Angelides: Also said that before bonds could be issued, interim steps needed
to be taken. Specifically -- that DWR and PUC must reach an agreement on
what rates must be paid on power contracts.  

On the phone were: * Michael Kahn;  Laura Holson (sp?);  Debra Feinstone
(sp?) -- All three listened in and did not participate.

We will be faxing handouts and news releases of this and other news
conferences to the team. If you don't receive them, please contact Kristin
Anderson at 916/442-2331 to request a fax.

PS - The Connell news conference has been postponed.
