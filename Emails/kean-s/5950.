Rosalee,

Steve Kean asked me to send you this documents for Mr. Lay's meeting with 
Ernesto Martens, Mexico's Secretary of Energy on Sunday Feb. 11th at 5:00 p.m.

I will pick up the Secretary at the airport and bring him to the Enron 
building for the meeting.

Please contact me if you need any additional information.

Best,

Ricardo
