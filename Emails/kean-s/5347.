SBX 28 (Sher) - Passed out of the Assembly Energy, Costs and
Availability Committee this afternoon.  The bill is still a work in
progress as Senator Sher has only accepted a few of the proposed
amendments from non-environmental interests.  Senator Sher is holding a
meeting right now to try and resolve some of the outstanding issues
prior to tomorrow's hearing in the Appropriations Committee.  Sandi and
Mike are participating in this meeting.
