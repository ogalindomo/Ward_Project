As we discussed yesterday, attached is a memorandum summarizing our 
mitigation options.  Also attached is a schematic show how PGE could be 
interconnected to Sierra through LADWP.  The schematic is in Word format so I 
could not consolidate the two documents.

Please call me if you have any questions.
