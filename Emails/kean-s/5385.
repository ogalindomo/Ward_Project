Jeanne:

Thanks for checking about the rooms.  Steve Kean will not be able to attend 
this time.  I checked with our DC office for a replacement and unfortunately 
they couldn't attend either.

Thanks again for checking - I really appreciate it.

Will you be attending the the Adam Smith Dinner May 1-- and the Board
meeting May 2?

If so, will you want a hotel room at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill?
They will be releasing the room block tomorrow.  The hotel is completely
booked with a wait list ... so, tomorrow is D-Day.

just a reminder in case you do need a room.
