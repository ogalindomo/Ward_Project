Cheney's office asked us to fax them prior to the meeting a document on what 
we intend to talk about.  Rick and I agreed to send the document we gave to 
Karl Rove a couple of weeks ago.  We sent this to Rosie so that she could fax 
it to Cheney.  She showed it to Ken first.  He had edits to the document.  
They are below.
FYI.  The document, as revised, is being faxed to Cheney now.
