Subject: Trojan Settlement Media Materials

For your review, I've attached all the draft external publications we're
preparing related to the Trojan Cost Recovery Settlement.

- Key Messages (power point)
- News Release
- Media Facts - Q & A

As we may have an announcement early next week, it would be greatly
appreciated if I could receive your feedback today.

(An internal  only "Issues and Perspective" is also being prepared.)

Many thanks,

- Mark
