The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air 
quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and 
explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial 
groups.

WHEN:  Friday, May 18
TIME:   9:30 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided
WHERE:  Enron Building (Room TBC)

A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the 
London office.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

An agenda is forthcoming.  If you have any questions or suggestions in 
advance of the meeting, please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.
