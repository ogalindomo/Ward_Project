Jane,

As the lead on both the tariff issues as well as mega status, please provide 
me with the list of regulatory issues for discussion at this meeting.  Since 
I am in Houston, I may want to personally discuss these with you in early 
January.

Vrinda/Kelly, 

Please do the same with respect to the PR issues.  Perhaps, early Jan maybe a 
good time for me to get this list, so that I can discuss the same.

I will need the same to prepare the agenda and have the team prepare for the 
meeting.  

Ranabir/Rahul,

Mohan will be the lead on the finance side on the mega status, and my team is 
already involving him in our discussions.  Would you like to have him prepare 
a small list of finance issues ?

Sandeep (Katwala),

Please let me know of key things on the legal side for discussion.  You can 
update the group on the CERC forming Act.  Please jot me a small note on the 
legal  issues list when you get the message.

Also, I need to know who is likely to be on the ground from the regulatory 
side.  

Terry & Steven - Are you both going to be in town ?

Regards,
Sandeep.
