You ought to take a look at this.  I completely agree with the approach, 
especially continuing to own the ball and ramping up the pressure.  The 
specific language is in the fourth paragraph.  (I know the "Indian English" 
is a bit stilted.)

		 Subject: DPC Press Release on GoI Counter Guarantee

A decision will be made this evening on whether to exercise the GOI counter 
guarantee for the month of January.  As discussed, if we proceed with this 
action, we will want to continue past practice and issue a DPC press 
release.  Please note that the fourth paragraph to the draft release includes 
wording indicating growing lender concern.  As a consequence, we would 
appreciate your (IR) concurrence as well as any comments on this approach.

Thanks,

John
