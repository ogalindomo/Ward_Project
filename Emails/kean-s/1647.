First, let me congratulate you on your terriffic quarter of earnings growth,
up 31% over the same period last year . Absolutely spectacular. Your
shareholders must be quite happy with that type of performance. Your company
executives should be proud. 

I live in Spring Valley, California. I paid $357 for my electricity for the
months of July, August and September. Not only that, I might be on the hook
for untold thousands of dollars when the current electric legislation
expires in 2002. I know that Enron is a member of the California Power
Exchange.  You cannot sit there and tell me that you did not benefit from
the exploding energy prices caused by "DEREGULATION". And, I'm also pretty
sure this is not the only email you have received commenting on the high
prices of energy.

I just wanted to congratulate you on the fine quarter. Keep sucking up those
profits... Like a vampire.
