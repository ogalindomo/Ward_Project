Happy New Year! Its my understanding that you lead the effort last year with 
focus groups to develop Enron's new vision statement. I would like to be a 
part of that effort this year. Here is my suggestion:

  "Leading, Creating, Exceeding
   ENRON
       A Visionary Company"

We lead markets ...... Gas, Electric
We Create markets ....... Weather trading, Peaker Plants, EBS
Our Culture is to Exceed the mark
We have to be visionary to create the "Wall Street" of the south

I hope this is helpful and that I can be a part of any effort to develop 
Enron's vision. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk
