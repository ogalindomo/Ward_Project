is in constant flux. However, we need to know our position in case any of t=

bellow does occurred.

Scott Baugh, Republican Assembly Leader, had a press conference in which th=
e=20
republicans declared that:

They accept Duque's Decision as is.=20

They are going to, request a special legislative session starting September=

The legislative session is going to look into supplementing focusing on=20

sitting. Furthermore, they will propose to provide relief in addition to=20
Duque's decision, by providing  an extra $300 MM, retroactive to June 1,=20
2000,  to schools, hospitals and local government in the form of a tax cred=
it=20
or cut and from the general fund. =20

They do not support the Davis/Alpert Bill (SDG&E Rate Freeze). (However, th=
e=20
San Diego Republicans will probably vote for it).

This also seems to take some wind out of the Pescetti bill (Freeze Extensio=
n).

This seems to be a political play. We do not believe that the republicans=
=20
think that the Governor will actually declare a special session. The Alpert=
=20
bill will  most likely be heard tomorrow. We do not know in which form and=
=20
whether or not it will be amended.

There also is a current rumor that a new bill may be introduce that would p=

the Wood Draft Decision into a bill. Our comments on the Wood decision focu=

mostly on the recovery mechanism, limiting the application of the cap to=20

paid for the costs associated with  the cap.

Attached is a brief summary of Woods proposal.

street lighting customers at 6.5 cents/kwh
creates a balancing account to ensure that SDG&E is "made whole"
uses all revenues generated by SDG&E-owned or managed assets (e.g. qualifyi=
