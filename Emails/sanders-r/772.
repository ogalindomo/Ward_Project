Mary and Jim:

Did you see in the PG&E/SCE filing that the two companies have kindly
volunteered (p. 32) to "assist the Commission in developing a full record
and in undertaking the rigorous analysis needed to fix the problems in the
California markets and determine refund responsibility". How kind and
public-spirited of them. More seriously, I would expect that they already
have a full economic analysis going on prices, damages, etc.
