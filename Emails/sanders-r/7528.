        David,

        I was told by Helen that you are out on well-deserved paternity leave 
(congratulations on the birth of your daughter!) but would be in Thursday 
morning and would be available to discuss this matter at 2:00 pm London time, 
8:00 am Houston time.  I will call you then.

 Britt

 David,

 I will be telefaxing to you today Underwriters' preliminary response to our 
claim.  I will call you tomorrow morning (assuming that you are in) to 
discuss. 

 Many thanks.

 Britt
