As most of you may already know, Kelly Mahmoud has resigned from ENA 
(effective 3/31).  There are a few items we need to discuss how ENA wants to 
manage going forward.  These include (among potential others):

paying incoming bills (I currently have the checkbook)
accounting
incoming mail
fiscal reporting for cal 2001
dissolution of the company this year ( we don't want to keep incurring 
franchise taxes, paying auditors, etc...)
outstanding litigation issues/risks
monetization of the DLGP equity

Probably wouldn't hurt to have Robert Stephens from Bracewell Patterson 
present as well but I'll leave that call up to Dan Lyons and Richard 
Sanders.  Also, feel free to invite others as any of you see fit.

BETH - PLEASE TRY AND SET UP A 1 HOUR MEETING W/ AS MANY OF THE LIST ABOVE AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE.
