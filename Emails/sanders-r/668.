Mike,
 We are working on revising the draft email to the CPUC and need some
additional information from you.  First, would it be accurate to say that
Enron Energy Marketing Corporation and Enron Energy Services Operations Inc.
do not have responsive documents to the subpoenas and that any information
would reside at ESS?  In other words, we do not have documents to produce
from those two entities.  If that is not correct, how would we describe what
documents these entities have/what will we produce?
 To the extent that ESS is evaluating whether it will provide
electronic data (less the customer specific information), we also need to
know how that process is going, whether the data will be similar to what
EMPI is working on, and whether an October 27, 2000 production date is
realistic.

Thanks
Gary
