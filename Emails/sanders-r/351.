		 Subject: OFTI Presentation


Please find attached the presentation that I have prepared for the meeting 
with Ray Bowen in regard to OFTI. I have included the points that need to be 
addressed in the meeting. I would appreciate if you could review it, make all 
your comments and send it back to me so I can have it changed. The meeting 
will be at 4:00 PM in the conference room EB2947 and I will call Kevin Peter 
from there. Please feel free to make any changes that may be appropriate, 
especially in regard to legal issues.
thanks,
Gustavo
