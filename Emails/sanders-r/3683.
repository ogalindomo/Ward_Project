Subject: General Counsels of Southern and Duke

Today, I talked to the GC of both Southern and Duke.  Each GC said they were 
not really up to speed on the issues.  I took the opportunity to walk them 
through the Nerc letter and the action taken at the Serc board meeting.  They 
each attempted to argue our fight was really with TVA.
