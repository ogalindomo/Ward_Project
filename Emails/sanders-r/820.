Attached is a draft of the letter the Tenaska IV partnership is prepared to 
send to Clifton Karnei in response to his October 20 request to "show cause" 
as to why recent outages of the Cleburne Plant do not constitute a default 
under the PPA.  Carl Tricoli and I will be contacting you later in the day to 
discuss any feedback you may have on the letter.
