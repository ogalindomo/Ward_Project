Martin, Nicole and Marcus,

This will confirm our telephone conference of today's date.  Again, you 
authorized me to go forward immediately with the recommendation set forth in 
the attached Word document.  I will accordingly contact Scottsboro today and 
get the ball rolling.

Britt

P.S. to Richard--I just left you a voice-mail on this.  Marcus is fully up to 
speed if you can't catch me (my day today is pretty crazy).  I plan to 
contact Scottsboro after lunch to go forward with this.
