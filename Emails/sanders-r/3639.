Subject: Peabody


George informed me of the pending situation with Peabody and I told him that 
when I was with Pittston we had a 
dispute with the NS railroad which hinged upon the fungibility of coking 
coal. Pittston's chief technical guy was George
Denton, now retired and , I believe, is available for consultation. George is 
highly respected and has a vast amount of
data and experience . Please advise me if you would wish to talk to him.

Thank you

Sean Casey
