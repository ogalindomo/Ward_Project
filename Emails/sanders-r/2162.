Susman Godfrey, which practices everywhere, even in the Bronx?

If not those guys, how about:

1.  Boies & Schiller (but not Andy Hayes)

2.  Mel Weiss of Milberg Weiss

3.  Jamie Stecher-- a good friend of mine and great lawyer who left Paul
Weiss years ago and has a small litigation boutique

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?
