I forgot to mention to you yesterday that Don Schultz of Holland & Hart
called late Friday and asked where we were in providing information so that
he could bill the Joint Defense Group for the work done on the Kansas motion
to dismiss.

I told him that the bills had been assembled and would be sent to him
shortly.  I don't know whether you have already sent the materials to
Schultz.  If not, do you have everything that you need from me?
