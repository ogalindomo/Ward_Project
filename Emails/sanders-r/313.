Privileged and Confidential - For Instruction of 
Counsel                                                 Attached is a revised 
copy of the Background note discussed earlier this week.  The revisions are 
based on comments  from Frontier Economics and GPC, and further reflection by 
Rob Hemstock and myself. I have also attached the  raw calculations from 
Frontier that underlie several of the revisions.  I have not  sent the 
revised document to outside counsel for review.
