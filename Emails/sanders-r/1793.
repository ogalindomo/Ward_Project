Thanks, Bob, but I think Mr. Sander's shop will carry this one forward - is 
that right Richard? 

By the way, when I spoke Marty Penkwitz yesterday, who had been working the 
OEC - MESC deal to date, he did not think we needed to be present or that we 
had an interest at stake since OEC's O&M agreement had essentially been 
approved. Marty, let me know if I mischaracterized your input.
