Rich,

We are currently talking to a few parties about the possible sale of New=20
Albany.  I expect to send out draft schedules to the form of Purchase and=
=20
Sale Agreement on Wednesday.  These schedules will reveal the existence of=
=20
the litigation between Power Systems and GE and I expect that numerous=20
questions will follow.  What I would like to do is prepare for these=20
questions in advance so as to not slow down negotiations.  Does it make sen=
se=20
to make copies of the files that we have to date (including the petitions,=
=20
etc. on the existing equipment and the legal opinions on the new equipment=
=20
that Power Systems is trying to sell us)?  If so, please have Linda put thi=
s=20
together ASAP.  Please ask her to separate the information dealing with the=
=20
existing problems from the information on the possible solutions (i.e. new=
=20
Power Systems technology currently being offered).  This is because I do no=
t=20
expect to immediately offer up the new technology as a solution that we are=
=20
willing to provide. =20

If this doesn=01,t work, please let me know. =20

Many thanks in advance.
