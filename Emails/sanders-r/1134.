Dear Mark:

 As we discussed this afternoon, what follows is a list of categories

  1. Documents reflecting communications, created between
January 1999 and October 1999, (including emails) between Enron/HEOF
Management and third parties, including without limitation Wells Fargo and
Covenant, regarding the HEOF Fund, Intrust, and/or Jim Mingey.


  2. Documents reflecting communications, created between
January 1999 and October 1999, between Enron/HEOF Management and Intrust
and/or Jim Mingey (including emails) regarding the HEOF Fund, Intrust,
and/or Jim Mingey.

  3.  Documents reflecting Enron/HEOF Management internal
communications, created between January 1999 and October 1999, (including

Management to get others involved in the HEOF Fund.

 If you have any questions give me a call.  Thanks.
