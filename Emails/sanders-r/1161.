Mr. Cheek:
I got your e-mail address out of Martindale.  I need to set up a corporate
rep depo to get information concerning an employee of Enron Capital and
Trade who lives in Dallas and offices in Houston.  Could you refer me to
whoever in your office would handle that, so I can set it up with a minimum
of inconvenience to all concerned?
Thanks,
Bart Wulff
