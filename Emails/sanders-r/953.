Mike Day has been in discussions with Harvey Morris this week about Enron's
responses.  According to Harvey, they are about to issue a second motion to
compel at FERC and if Enron does not want to get its name on that pleading,
we are being asked to give a date certain when we will have data available
for the PUC.  Today we submitted the EES/EEMC data which Harvey
acknowledged.  Harvey claims he is under extreme pressure to treat Enron as
being not cooperative.  We need to decide what to do with the Portland
General information as well.  I know that Dave Aamodt would like to produce
that information to the PUC if at all possible.  According to Mike Day, we
probably have a few days to respond before the PUC will move to compel.  By
then we would need to submit our formal objections and responses.

Thanks
Gary
