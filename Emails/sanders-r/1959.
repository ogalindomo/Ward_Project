		 Subject: Potential Arbitrators

Does anyone have any particular information about these potential 
arbitrators, all of whom are located in Dallas:  

   Robert L. Blumenthal (lawyer with Carrington, Coleman, sloman & 
Blumenthal); 
   Dudley Chambers (lawyer with Jackson Walker); 
   Hugh E. Hackney (lawyer with Locke Liddell);
   Randall E. Hand (in-house lawyer with Allegiance Telecom, Inc.);
   Alan Weichsel Harris (lawyer with Andrews & Kurth); 
   Robert W. Jordan (lawyer with Baker Botts); 
   Melinda G. Jayson (General Counsel of Hall Financial Group); 
   Elizabeth Lang-Miers (lawyer with Locke Liddell);
   Douglas Lang (lawyer with Gardere Wynne);
   Jeffrey S. Osgood (lawyer with Strasburger Price). 

I know that Baker Botts, Locke Liddell, and Andrews Kurth are representing 
Enron on current matters, and that Gardere Wynne has represented Enron in the 
past.

Thank you.
