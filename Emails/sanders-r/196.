As a follow-up to my earlier e-mail, an "Intrust Case" sub-directory file has 
been created under the  o:commom\seedcapital drive.  Please make sure to copy 
any HEOF 1 related files to the "Intrust Case" folder.  Also, be advised that 
electronic files being requested for HEOF1 Portfolio Companies includes 
e-mails to-and from our portfolio companies.  We are currently working with 
IT support  to get all files restored that might have been deleted since then.

Thanks,

DD
