Hi Linda

I have just faxed to you the statement that reflects the various items 
charged by Watson Farley, which was attached to Watson's invoice.  My 
apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Subject: WFW - pacific virgo invoices

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.
