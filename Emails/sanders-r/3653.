Neale / Suzanne

Below is Sheila's breakdown of the P&L impact for your reference. 

As spoken with Neale earlier, we have instructed Rajah & Tann to do the 
necessary searches on MTM and EPTS to establish if they have substantial 
assets in Singapore. I will forward the results to you once received on order 
that you may opine fully on the merits of the case and arbitration procedure.

Regards

Matt
