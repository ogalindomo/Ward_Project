Richard,
 I just got off the phone with Nancy Pickover, a Bracewell paralegal,
who obtained for us the CPUC filing with FERC.  She is sending the 500 page
document overnight to me and to you Richard.  I will get a copy to Mike Day.
She is faxing the 16 page pleading and one of the exhibits immediately.  In
essence AES, Williams, Duke, Dynegy, Reliant and Southern are the named
entities.  As soon as we have more I will let you know.

Thanks
Gary
