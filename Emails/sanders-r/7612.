Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:  Grynberg JDT
From:  Don Schultz

             Attached is the final version of the letter I am now sending to 
Judge Downes on the subject of Gene Wright's deposition.   I added some text 
along the lines of Gerry Pecht's suggestions in yesterday's phone conference, 
and with his input this afternoon.  I did this so the letter better fits with 
the editing done by the Wright Defendants in the last 24 hours on their 
submission.
           I believe this final version is consistent with the views you have 
all expressed to me.  Please let me know if you see anything problematic.  
(There was not enough time available, after I could review the latest changes 
in the Wright Defendants' brief, to circulate another draft of this letter.  
And, the changes did not seem to warrant asking the Court to extend the time 
for filing this.)  Thanks for your cooperation.  Don.
