What an interesting idea.  I worked at Williams for 5 years (pipeline and 
telecom), and am pretty familiar with how they operate.  If you believe that 
it would strengthen our chances to have them as a co-plaintiff, without 
significant risk to us, then let's invite them in.  I don't think we are at 
risk of disclosing any competitive information that Williams doesn't already 
know about us (but, clients, please let me know immediately if you disagree), 
and I know that you will keep each of Williams' and Enron's confidential 
information separate and private.  I wonder how their entry would affect the 
time we need to put on our case?  I also wonder if there is enough to bring 
them in and still have a polished presentation?

If you decide this would be best for Enron, then unless you hear otherwise 
from me, invite them in.

Kenton, I have been snooping around a little and learned
that yesterday Williams Pipeline had a dispute with Mears.
They were working around their gas pipeline and parked a
cat on it without providing notice to Williams.  I thought I
would subpoena the Williams employee to substantiate our
experience with Broadwing.
 We represent Williams in a number of things, and I am
currently condemning an easement in Colorado for
Williams.  So I made a courtesy call to their legal
department regarding the subpoena.  The folks at Williams
tell me that they may be interested in joining the lawsuit if
they could do that by Monday.  Broadwing will be crossing
their pipelines and communication lines five more times in
Wyoming, and they have real concerns based upon their
experience so far.  I assume that Williams is a competitor of
Enron in some respects, and advised that I would not do so
without Enron's permission.  I don't believe there would be
any conflict on our end, and I think the companies would be
aligned.  It might also make a stronger impression on the
court to have another plaintiff.   They have not made a
decision yet, but to get the ball rolling I told them I would
discuss the issue with you.  Please give me your thoughts.
