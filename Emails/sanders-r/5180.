britt,

will not be able to discuss your question about eric tan with commercial 
people until monday as john chismar is traveling right now. however, 
hopefully the testing will answer a lot of questions such that we may not 
need his services after year end.

Subject: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO

 I am pleased to report that Mitsubishi has agreed to have the joint analysis 
take place in the U.K.  We have instructed our chemist to immediately arrange 
for this.  We still await Mitsubishi's response to our request that they 
share the costs of transportation from Singapore to the U.K.   

 Paul, given that Eric Tan is apparently leaving very soon, would you let me 
know whether (a) he still needs to be kept in the loop on this and (b) 
whether some other business person in Singapore will be the liaison person? 

 David Best will shortly confirm the appointment of the arbitrator.  Once 
that is done, he will approach Mitsubishi's solicitors regarding the 
without-prejudice payment of freight and demurrage.  David has indicated that 
he likes the time bar argument against Mitsubishi's demurrage claim and that 
before offering to negotiate the demurrage claim at all, he will ask 
Mitsubishi's solicitors how they would get around that problem, and see what 
they say.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt
