I refer to the List of Samples I crculated by fax yesterday (copy attached 
for your easy reference).

The Batangas samples referred to in Ref. Page 3 have arrived at SGS 
Singapore. SGS Philippines has explained to Eric why some containers are not 
full :-

The individual tank samples were drawn ex Pacific Virgo and put into 
containers but were not sealed. They were transported to the Subic Bay lab 
where ship's composite samples were made for testing by mixing the samples. 
The remainder was put into containers and sealed. One ship's composite sample 
was tested. Parts of some other sealed samples were used (ie. seals broken) 
for verification tests. The remainder were re-sealed, hence some containers 
are not full.

Please advise whether you wish for us at this juncture to enquire with SGS 
Philippines about the results/raw data of the verification tests.
