Here is the Milberg opposition to the ex-parte application and the motion to
stay in Hendricks.  It was apparently filed and served by mail on Friday,
although I had to call Simon's office yesterday to get a copy.  Note that
Milberg makes no mention of the 455 issue.

Krause is apparently filing an opposition brief today in Gordon.

We will discuss hearing status, etc on call today.
