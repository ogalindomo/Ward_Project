- Attached is the core market pool performance bond.  Debtor's counsel is of 
the opinion that the bond permits a one-time draw and does not replenish.  My 
preliminary review yields the same result.  Our analysis after a more 
thorough review will follow shortly.
- I have asked debtor's counsel for information with regard to how SCE's 
unpaid administrative fees were dealt with by PX (and indeed generally how PX 
calculated/handled chargebacks) and will keep following up until I receive 
the requested information.
