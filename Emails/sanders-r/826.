Attached is a response to the October 20 letter from Clifton Karnei of Brazos 
Electric that has been prepared on PPE's behalf by the ENA legal department.  
As we discussed, Rick Vicen's signature is required on the document, which 
should be sent on PPE letterhead.

In light of your plans for vacation, I would be happy to take care of the 
letter's distribution if you have Rick send the executed copy to me via fax 
at 713-853-9505.
