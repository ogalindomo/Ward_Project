Kathy, Bob Williams should attend this meeting tomorrow in my absence.

I think the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the UC/CSU contract in the 
SDG&E service area.  Richard, I think you are included because  EES will be 
briefing John Lavarato later this week.  Bob, can you bring Richard up to 
speed on the issues?
