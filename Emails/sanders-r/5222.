Tanya,

This will confirm that you and my other clients have decided to go forward 
with initiating arbitration in the above-referenced matter, despite the 
up-front costs, and are comfortable with your own assessment of the risks of 
Triad having no executable assets, as well your own view that from a policy 
basis, this matter needs to go forward to make sure that other traders don't 
try the same thing.

I will prepare an arbitration demand and submit it for the review of anyone 
who needs to see it before it goes out.  It will be very short.  Please let 
me know who (if anyone) would like to see a draft first.

Britt

This should confirm the result of our meeting last Friday in which all 
parties agreed to move forward with pursuing a judgement against Triad Energy 
Resources for our outstanding receivable of $1,779,000.  Please send updates 
regarding the proceedings to me as they become available.

Thanks,
Tanya
