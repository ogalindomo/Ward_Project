Project Stanley tapes were destroyed.

NGX is covered - we continue to negotiate a commercial solution which will 
see EOL data included in the index - had a meeting Friday and we are getting 
closer.

The shaved head is Powell's deal - can you believe a guy shaving his head 
just to suck up for a promotion?

Did we ever destroy these tapes?
Also-- I am assuming that NGX is well covered and that you don't need any 
help. If not, please let me know. Perhaps I can get info from Mark Powell--by 
the way is there some sort of fashion trend in Canada invoving shaved heads?
