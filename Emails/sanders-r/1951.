Subject: Negative CTC

Bob:

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a brief listing of some of the pros 
and cons we talked about regarding the Negative CTC.  This is not all 
inclusive, but I thought it would assist our discussions.

The arguments here focus solely on legal ones.  It does not address the 
policy issues/considerations that the Negative CTCs obviously raise.

I have copied those shown as "CCs".  Could you forward to anyone else who 
should receive this.

John
