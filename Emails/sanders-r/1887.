It all depends on what the letter says---but I am sure it is fine. I am here 
this am.

		 Subject: Internal Legal Representation Letter

Richard-

We are currently nearing the end of our audit for EnSerCo, L.L.C. and 
therefore we need to send out an internal legal representation letter.  I 
know that you were the person who signed the letter last year and therefore I 
was wondering if you could sign it for us this year as well.  If could let me 
know, then I can bring this by to you Thursday morning for your signature.

Thanks,
Kristi Voinis
