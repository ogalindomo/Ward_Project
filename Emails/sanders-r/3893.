We can now take a decision on the following re TenneT's allocation of 
capacity to Sep:

1. Finalise and file our submissions to the Nma on this issue (my suggestion 
- we should do it)

2. Initiation of civil injunction proceedings against TenneT (my suggestion - 
we should do it)

3. Lodge submissions in the appeal against Dte Decision 5 (my suggestion - 
unsure from the letter below that Clifford Chance are on point on this issue 
-  need to revisit this issue with them).

NOTE:  Prof Leigh Hancher (high profile Competion Law expert at Leiden 
University with particular interest in energy sphere, who has gone to press 
in the last few days with views on the whole Dutch situation which are the 
same as ours) has been notified by Clifford Chace not to accept instructions 
which conflict with Enron - i.e. effectively retained to be Enron's expert 
witness in proceedings.  We shall be calling Prof. Hancher to take her 
further views etc., on the situation.

Let's discuss way forward at the earliest.

Kind regards

Mark
