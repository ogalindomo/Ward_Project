		 Subject: Meeting with Portland General


Richard,
 I contacted Al Alexanderson at Portland General as you suggested to
set up a meeting with the Portland General traders to learn about their
trading strategies.  This will probably happen some time next week.  In my
discussion with Al, they have taken the approach of creating a supply stack
for all of their OOM and bids over $150 and are applying a most expensive
first approach to establishing cost basis for FERC and other requests.  I
think it makes sense to look at what they have done and see how their
proposal would work on EPMI data and vice versa.  Do you concur?

Thanks
Gary
