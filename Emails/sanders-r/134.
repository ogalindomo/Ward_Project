As I understand it, the meeting is planned for the full day (including 
lunch), although I do not know the exact starting time.  John Odam, the 
mediator, will most likely set the time.  Because Enron in-house counsel 
duties are shifting from Kenton to Richard Sanders, Twanda Sweet (Richard's 
assistant) will be finishing the details of the meeting.  I am forwarding the 
information I have to Twanda so she can finish up the details and get this 
information out to all interested parties. I can tell you that the mediation 
will be held at the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street in Houston.  A 
conference room and 3-4 breakout rooms have been reserved.  If you have any 
other questions, Twanda's # is 713-853-9402.  Richard Sanders # is 
713-853-5587.

What are the actual meeting times for the meeting on June 8th, and what is
the floor or room number and street address for the meeting place?  Thanks.
