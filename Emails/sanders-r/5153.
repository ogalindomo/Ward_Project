Richard,
 I know there is a lot going on, but I do want to confirm that Tower
Snow, Chairman of the Firm, and Greg Markel, who is on our policy committee
(equivalent to the Board of Directors) are available to meet with you and
Jim Derrick on Tuesday December 19, 2000  at 11:00 a.m. here in San
Francisco with lunch afterwards.  It may be that with recent events, the
schedule you discussed will need to be changed.  Could you let me know
whether you plan on going forward so I can get things set up here?  Thanks
again for the opportunity.

Gary
