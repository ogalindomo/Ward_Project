Two days ago the PX posted a notice of a sanctions committee meeting on 
December 14th.  The agenda for that meeting is to:
 
1. Describe the Administrative Sanctions Procedures as set forth in Schedule 
10 of the CalPX Tariff. 

2. Describe the operation of the Sanctions Committee.

3. Take comments from CalPX Participants.

I'd like to recommend that Sue attend this meeting and recommend that the 
CalPX needs to refile its sanctions procedures in light of the FERCs dicta in 
the New York ISO case.  What do others think?
