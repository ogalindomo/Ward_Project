Tim,

Here is another question that you might face:

Q: How to you explain Enron continuing to charge unjust and
unreasonable prices?

A: I disagree with the premise of your question.  I am not here to
discuss the specifics pertaining to Enron.  However, in my view, Enron
responded appropriately to the complex market conditions that existed and
continue to exist.  The determination of what is just and reasonable under
the circumstances that is in the jurisdiction of FERC.  I do not have
available to me all the information that FERC has so I am not prepared to
comment further.  Based upon what the information I have, however, I believe
that the the payments received by Enron were just and reasonable under the
circumstances.

Thanks
Gary
