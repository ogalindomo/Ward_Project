Confidential and Privileged Attorney-Client Communication

I attended a seminar this morning at which Joan Feldman of Computer Forensics 
spoke.  I think it would be a good idea for us to have a conference call with 
Joan to review our email storage policy.   If you agree, I will have my 
assistant set one up.
