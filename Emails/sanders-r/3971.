Attached is a DRAFT Discussion Outline Strategy for our PREP meeting on 3/9.  
This is for internal use ONLY as a guide to help us develop a "unified" ENE 
voice.  Please review and be prepared to comment to make our meeting on 3/9 
more productive and efficient.  If you'd like to respond w/ comments, etc... 
prior I'll do my best to incorporate them.
