Please consider the following retired judges from Chicago.  I don't know any
of them personally and there is a good chance that neither does Paul Weiss:
Abner Mikva, Seymour Simon, Frank McGarr.  They come highly recommended by
my friend Marv Aspen, the Ch. Judge of the ND Ill.

Subject: Arbitrators for Blockbuster Arbitration


We have been given a new list of potential arbitrators.  Please take a
minute and let me know if any of these represent us, and the general
level of representation.  Thank you again for your help.  If you want to
leave me a voicemail, my telephone number is (713) 646-6412.

     1.  William Frank Carroll--Donohoe, Jameson & Carroll
     2.  James E. Coleman Jr.--Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal
     3.  Randall Duke--Johnson & McElroy
     4.  Edward Fiorito--Consultant
     5.  Eric F. Hale, Jr.--formerly with Carrington, Coleman; now
self-employed
     6.  Herbert J. Hammond--Thompson & Knight
     7.  Orrin Harrison--V&E
     8.  Brian J. Hurst--Baker & McKenzie
     9.  C. Michael Moore--Locke Liddell
    10.  Robert C. Prather, Sr.--Jordan, Dunlap, Prather & Harris,
L.L.P.

No need to respond as to V&E or Locke Liddell, except as to information
about the individuals.  Steve et al.,  Baker & McKenzie does represent
Enron on several matters of which I am aware, but to my knowledge it is
not one of our top 10 firms in billings.
