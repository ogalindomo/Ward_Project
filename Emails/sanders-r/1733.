		 Subject: Heartland Steel bankruptcy

You received a service of process notice yesterday related to the Heartland 
Steel matter.  That bankruptcy was filed in early February 2001, and, 
according to my correspondence, it is being handled to Lisa Mellencamp.  I am 
forwarding my copy of the notice received to her for further handling.
