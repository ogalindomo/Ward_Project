Yet one more complaint regarding electricity prices in California:

Inc., et al., EL01-2-000 (10/06/00) -- Petitions the Commission to: (1) 
rectify unjust and unreasonable prices stemming from the wholesale markets 
for energy and ancillary services operated by the California ISO and 
California PX; (2) make findings that the events and circumstances 
surrounding the June 14, 2000 rolling outage in the San Francisco Bay Area
