As you know we're in the process of trying to close a transaction to sell 
substantially all of the assets of Ecogas to Pacific Natural Energy.  As part 
of the process, and in order to close, we have to settle over 80 account 
payables issues (totaling > $4.7MM).  Several of these are law firms which 
were representing or had represented Ecogas.  They are as follows:

Bracewell Patterson
Locke Liddell
Millbank Tweed
V&E
Fulbright & Jaworski

It was my understanding the ENA Legal had discussed the payment (or lack 
thereof) issues with these firms.  However, I'm getting calls from them (F&J 
and Millbank Tweed, so far) now that they've received the Creditor Settlement 
& Release Agreement which was sent to them last Friday and they're acting 
very surprised!

I need to know who should interface w/ these firms and that these issues are 
being settled.  We will need to address this among other issues tomorrow 
morning at our 9 a.m. meeting.
