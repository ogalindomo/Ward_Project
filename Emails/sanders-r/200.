had at our last meeting, I am sending out notices of deposition noticing the
depositions of:
1. Calpine's credit person;
2. Calpine Corp.'s credit person;

lawsuit or if Bill Ogden or I can be of further assistance on this matter.

                                            Sincerely,

                                            Laura Gibson
