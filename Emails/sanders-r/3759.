Richard,
 Please let me know what, if anything, I can do to assist you all in 
determining when to make the settlement payment in this matter.  As you know, 
if the payment is made before January, the interest is avoided.  I will keep 
you posted if I receive anything from Clyde & Co.  Otherwise, please call if 
I can do anything further to help out.  Thanks.
        GAIL
