Attached is the first cut of transaction data we have received from our 
electric desk--physical transactions for about 900 customer meters.  I'd like 
to discuss with you how we can edit or add to this data to make it similar to 
the EPMI data.  Although the customer names are still in here, we will 
replace those with numbers.  MDS
