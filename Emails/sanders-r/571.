My depo just got canned. I'll e-mail again when I'm coming down there and
hopefully grab lunch. Come visit your brother some weekend when Miller's
band is playing. Your children need to see your ancestral roots.

I have a depo on Weds. in the lovely Bayou City. Are you available for
lunch? I'll call Yardbird and Jones.
