Richard,

As requested, I have prepared a draft letter to be sent to Four-Four, Inc. 
demanding payment of the subcontractors immediately.  Also attached for your 
review is the letter directing the subcontractors' attorney to direct all 
future communications in the matter to you.  When I updated Barbara Gray on 
the matter she suggested that you handle the communications with the 
subcontractors' attorney.  According to the subcontractors' attorney a 
response is demanded by Friday March 24th.  If I can be of any further 
assistance please let me know.  I will forward the file on this matter 
immediately.  

 

Thanks,
Eric A. Gillaspie
