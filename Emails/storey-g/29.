Colleen/Geoff -

Only other issue I can think of, is making sure that deals with "I" risk do 
not show up in V@R calculation (Only deals with M gas daily risk should be 
downloaded into risktrac for V@R).

Subject: Gas Daily Issue

Geoff visited with me this morning regarding the Gas Daily Issue and I 
attempted to summarize this in the attached document.  If you get a chance 
before tomorrow's meeting, could you review this and see if I missed any 
major pieces?  (Just look at the First Tab that says Gas Daily, the TDS tab 
is nothing at this point.)  Geoff said he had talked this through with you so 
I thought you may recognize if I missed anything or misunderstood it.  (I 
also left a copy of it on his desk.)  Thanks.
