Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please 
sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the 
final signed copy to everyone.

On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress 
reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these 
will all be early deliveries!).  

Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II 
by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this.

All looks great so far.

Any problems - just give me a ring.

Thanks

Louise
