Subject: GTV II

I understand we have now finalized 90% requirements on the GTV II.

Please could we pull together the format inception document this week for 
signature on your meeting next week with Geof and Colleen.

Document to include all requirements, dependencies and timelines.

I would suggest whoever is writing this spend some time with Geof this week.

Please circulate to draft all listed above including me.

Thanks,

Louise
