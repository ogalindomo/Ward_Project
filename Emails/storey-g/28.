There is one more addition to the Meeting Notes from last week.  I overlooked 
the very important live feed for Gas Daily/intra-month curves, so the revised 
file below adds this as Issue #2a.

Also, regarding our next meeting:  Normally I'd like to hold our weekly 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however, I will not be here this Wednesday 
and Thursday.   So, please mark your calendars for a meeting on Tuesday, 
March 13 at 11:30 am in EB3270 to review progress, discuss the Gas Daily 
issues and address any questions on direction, priorities, etc.   Please let 
me know if you cannot attend.
