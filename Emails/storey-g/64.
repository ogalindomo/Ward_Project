Geoff and Chuck,

I have submitted an e-request for each of you to have access to the TDS 
Parallel environment.
Once this is complete, one of us will help you create a shortcut on your PC 
desktop to run it.
You should not need any additional access; you will use your existing TDS 
production id and password.

Thanks, d.n.
