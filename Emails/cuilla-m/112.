My add drops haven't been approved, so here's my  official lineup:
?
QB???? Beurlein
RB???? Wheatley
RB???? Smith
WR??? Robinson
WR??? Morton
WR??? Ward
K??????  Detroit
D?????? New Orleans?

I can't log on to the CBS Sportsline server, and  I'm on my way out to play 
golf, so if any of the above wide receivers are on  bye, Gonzalez is the 
starter instead of them (but I think all those receivers  are playing).

Bench:
QB??? Plummer???  bye
RB???  James??????? bye
RB??? Chauncey
WR??? Gonzalez
WR??? Sanders???  bye
WR???  Mathis??????? may be injured
