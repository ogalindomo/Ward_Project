I made a few other changes after I had time to think about our discussion 
yesterday.  Let's get
another conference call to discuss why these points are important to Enron.

I have not had time to get with the traders yet. So please do not start 
e-mailing anything to them
yet.

Thanks,

Ruth acting as Martin Cuilla
