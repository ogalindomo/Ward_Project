Martin,
?
I've calculated the total points everyone has earned over the  course of the 
season based on where they finished each week.? For ties, i  took total bench 
points to determine ranking - i think that's the way we do  it.
?
Assuming we all started with 100:
Greg  Martin????????? 158
Mark Friedman???? 152
Gary Lamphier???? 147
Scott Earnest??????  144
Tony  Harris????????? 143
Jeff Gossett????????  142
Bill Kasemervisz? 141
Martin Cuilla???????  139
Mike Morris????????  138
Gary Taylor????????  136
?
Of course, this doesn't take into account the points we've bid  on for 
players we've picked up during the year.
