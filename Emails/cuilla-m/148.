Martin - You gave me Jeff George rather than Eddie George. - I don't want to 
use all my points to pick him back up in Free Agency.

QB - Steve McNair
RB - Jeff George
RB - Tim Biak.
WR - Iasaac Bruce
WR - Tim Brown
WR - Jerry Rice
K & D - Tennessee

Why do I like my team better than those 2nd place - NY Tailors?
