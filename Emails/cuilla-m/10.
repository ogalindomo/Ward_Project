Dear Sir or Madam:
?
?Thank you for  your interest in Cayton Furniture.? After reviewing your 
information, we  realized there was insufficient details for our company to 
suggest the proper  quotes.? In order to receive a quote on any type of 
furniture we carry, we  will need the manufacturer's name and the furniture 
manufacturer number.?  If you are inquiring about some piece of upholstery 
such as a sofa or loveseat,  we will also need the grade of the fabric.? We 
will be happy to respond to  your email once this information is given.? Once 
again thank you  for
your business.
?
