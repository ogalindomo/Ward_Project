Ladies and Gentlemen:

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) says electric system
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America this winter. Peak demand is expected to be 3% higher than last
winter's actual demand and 1% higher than last winter's projected demand.
As is always the case, extreme weather conditions and unanticipated
equipment problems have the potential to produce demands that exceed
generation and transmission margins.

A copy of the press release announcing NERC's 2000/2001 Winter Assessment
report is available on the following NERC web
site:  http://www.nerc.com/pressrelease/

Please share this information with others in your organization.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Sincerely,

Heather Gibbs
