Tom has extracted the crude trades from Clayton's database.  A spreadsheet is 
available in O:\Research\Common\From_BobLee\crudewti.eol.get.  We are working 
on a cleaner version, but this should allow everyone to get a view of the 
data we have.

The attachment below has a description of the data fields in the spreadsheet.

If you have ideas on how we should analyze this, let Tom or I know.
