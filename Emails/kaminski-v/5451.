Mike,

My number for next week is 66 (from Seasonal Holt-Winter model, SHW).

I am also fitting AGA to an ARIMAX model.  As discussed, I need weighted 
temperature
data for east, west and production areas.   I would appreciate if you could 
provide that data.
 After that, I could add forward price curve as explainatory variables. 

Since AGA is a market mover, it is important to have an accurate model.
