To:? Participants (and those who could not attend)
?????? the April 20 Wharton ET Conference

Thanks for participating in the recent Strategic Partnerships
conference at Wharton, and contributing to making it such a great success.

We are enclosing with this email a presentation that we unfortunately
had to cancel due to time constraints and we wanted to make sure you
saw this because it involves some very interesting statistics
involving EMAIL and informal organizational structure.

Ruhul Quddus, an MBA student here at Wharton, with advice from several
faculty and researchers (including us) has developed a procedure
that allows firms to map their informal organization structure using
email logs from the email server (note: the content of the emails is NOT
required; just the data on who emails whom).

Ruhul's initial results are very interesting and thought provoking in that 
they
show that consideration of informal organization structure can potentially
enhance the value of decision making in situations such as integrating
acquisitions and coordinating alliances.? We hope you will look through the
attached slides which outline some of his findings.

Ruhul's contact information can be found on the slides.
