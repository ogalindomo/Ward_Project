John,

I want to thank you for your compliment to the work that we have done for the 
Liberty 
County Storage facility valuation. 

You and your talented associate Ms. Tian gave me a lot of valuable insights 
to understand all
the aspects of the deal, so it was also a great learning experience for me.  

If you think the Research can help you in any way to your deals,  storage, 
transport, MTBE, real options, 
or whatever,  just let me know, we will get the job done. 

Zimin
