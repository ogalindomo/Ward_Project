Thanks for the interest so many of you have shown in Trash Bash.  Several of 
you are of the mistaken idea that TRASH BASH is tomorrow.  It is not until 
SATURDAY, MARCH 31, 2001.   Registration will be in Sam Houston Park and 
trash will be picked up along Buffalo Bayou from So. Shephard to the Wortham 
Center.   The work areas will be divided into 8 to 10 Sections.  When you 
check in, you will be assigned to a work section.  If you are going to work 
at the Registration Desk, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 7:30 AM.  If 
you are going to pick-up trash, you need to be at Sam Houston Park by 8:00 AM.

There will be a pre-registration desk set up in the Lobby of the Enron Bldg. 
sometime during the week of March 26th and I will let you know the exact 
dates when they are given to me.  If you pre-register, you won't have to 
stand in the long lines at Sam Houston Park.

Thanks again for your interest and help.

Anita
