Hi,

Vince has requested me to inform you that Foreign Language Lessons are 
available.  
Among the languages offered are Spanish, Portugese, French, German, Mandarin, 
and Japanese.
Other languages are possible.   The lessons can be done in a small class or 
through a private tutor.
The schedule is quite flexible with the latest class being at 5:00 to 6:30 
p.m.  

To arrange classes, please contact Meilli Sanford at (713) 464-8474.  They 
would need an e-mail
approval from Vince to enroll.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,

Roy
