Hi Vince,

Following up to our chat on the phone.

Gordian Kemen will be arriving in Austin on the 16th. He will be staying in 
Austin for 2 weeks. He would very much appreciate to have the opportunity to 
have a talk with you to find out if there is a place for him at Enron. You 
can reach him under (512) 301-9819 (his parents in law's phone number). 

Thanks a lot for you help and attention,
