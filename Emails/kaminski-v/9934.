Hi Vince,

Thank you for sending me the email from Don Reid regarding the Turkey FX and 
CPI curve.  I received the same email last week and the request has been 
taken care of.  In fact, he had a very short time line for the request  and 
had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid.  If the deal goes 
through RAC, I'm sure we'll get another request for the curve, but for now, 
Don said that he doesn't need a forecast from us.  

Regards,

Farouk Z. Lalji
