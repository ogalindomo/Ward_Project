Maureen- thanks for your outstanding presentation on Friday.  Sorry again for 
the difficulties in scheduling.

I can see some excellent collection opportunities for our group as a result 
of your presentation and look forward to discussing them with you on my 
return.  We think we can get excellent info on production & exports in 
Russia, as well as good insight into anti-dumping out of DC and the WTO.  
Labor unrest, environmental problems, civil unrest are other possibilities.

FYI, the speeches from today's LME seminar will be posted on the LME website 
tomorrow.  You may be particularly interested in the outlooks for aluminum, 
nickel, and copper.
