A table (Table 2) has been added with probabilities for RAB > x, Fx > y.  At 
the current currency level, approx 1.5, all the numbers are multiplied by 1/2 
because the currency is equally likely to rise or fall.  This may give a 
pessimetic view of achieving a given stock price.

Let me know when you want to get togetrher.
