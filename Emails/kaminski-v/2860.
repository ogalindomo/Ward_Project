Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I will forward my resume. I am looking for a  trading position. I have three 
years of market-making experience in illiquid  markets, which I beleive is 
highly relevant. But it seems now that getting out  of my contract is not an 
alternative anymore.? I learned yesterday that my  firm finally decided to 
grant me what I wanted... a new desk. Sometimes I feel  that when you become 
a trader you come to trade everything, including your  career.
?
?I thank you for your time and  consideration.

Pierre
