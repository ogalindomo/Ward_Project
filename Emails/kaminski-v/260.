I took the large spreadsheet of data that we had before, and sorted the data 
so that I could just look at trades that took place off-peak (between 6:00 PM 
and 8:00 AM). Then, I sorted this data by counterparty, and looked at Hess's 
trading against us. It seems as though there are several clear occasions when 
they were bidding the price up, as shownin the graph within the spreadsheet.
