It appears that administratively Maureen's expenses in coming to London 
cannot be processed from this office.   Can I confirm that there is no doubt  
that the London office will pay these.  Could I therefore please ask Shirley 
to process them in Houston, and we will find out how they can then be charged 
back from Research in Houston to the London Metals cost centre.

Thanks in advance for you help.
