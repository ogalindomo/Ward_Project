Shirley,

Few items before I forget:

1. Trip to San Francisco. Leave March 19, evening about 5:30. 
Meeting with KMV on March 20th. I shall need the hotel in SF.
I shall come back on Fri evening (leaving SF around 5:30 p.m.), or Saturday 
morning
(leaving around 6:30 a.m.) depending on the price difference.
I shall take the rest of the week off.

Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried, Vasant are going as well.

2. Going to NYC for March 13 conference. A reminder.
