I am resending this - I forgot the Staffing Summary by Location.

Sorry!

I apologize, I have not been able to pin Vince down.  However, he did take
it with him this morning (he will be in PRC meetings all day.) and I told him\
you needed it yesterday.

I hope it is not too late.  Let me know.

Thanks

Shirley

Shirley,

I need the headcount information for Vince's group no later than Thursday,
