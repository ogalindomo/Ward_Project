Subject: SEEKING HISTORICAL WHOLESALE POWER PRICE DATA FOR UK

Vince  I am doing  a presentation  for  the Mexico City office  to advocate
for electric compeition and how it benefits industrials  over time  with 
lower rates....

Do you have a historical   price sequence  that would
give me an  annual  benchmark  for UK  wholesale  power  prices for these 
years:

for  1982  Fully closed market

1991  No barriers  to generation  entry

1993  Open  access to transmission  grid

1996  Choice for most industrial users

1998  Competition in wholesale and retail markets  in 1998

Any help you can give is appreciated  and I will send you a copy of the 
final  booklet..thanks Margaret
