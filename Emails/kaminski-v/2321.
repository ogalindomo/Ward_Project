Vince/Stinson,

Please find below two attachemnts.  The Excell spreadsheet shows some 
calculations on the savings from using Dabhol power as against a diesel 
genset operating at a higher heat rate.  There is also a differential in 
price of diesel, as against naphtha used by the plant.  I have taken data 
from the Septemeber bill of DPC.  We do not want to give the actual numbers 
to the press, since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent/kWh 
energy price of Dabhol that is reflected there.

The seond attachement (Word) has the wordings that I think we can send in to 
the press.  Please review the calculations and the note, ad if you find this 
satisfactory, please forward to Jeff/s.

I am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications.  The number 
(610 MW) for total captive generation in Maharashtra) is taken from Mohan 
Gurunath's presentation on this.

Regards,
Sandeep.
