Zimin, thanks for the meeting yesterday, your help is going to be very 
valuable for the analysis of our deal.  

Below you will find the names of the comparable companies you can use for the 
study of the volatility:

Cablevision
Comcast
Cox Communications
MediaOne Group
Rogers Communications
Time Warner

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter published a memorandum on  January 5/00   "US 
Investment Research: Cable Television"  where you can get detailed 
information on the performance of these companies


We will be working on the histogram during the weekend and we will be sending 
the results to you as soon as possible.
Regarding the quotes for the loan guarantee we will be getting them on Monday.

Please let me know if you will need any  additional information for the 
volatility study


Thanks and Regards,
