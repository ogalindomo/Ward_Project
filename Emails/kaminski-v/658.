Hi Norma,

 Sevil's primary project has been the Generation Bidding Analysis for the 
East Power Desk.  She worked closely with the Power Fundamentals group and 
the IT group in collecting and organizing the data, and then developing the 
analysis.  Sha has focused on the PJM area and plans to expand the analysis 
to other regions in the East.
 Sevil has also investigated the issue of Risk Premia in Power Prices 
compared to Marginal Cost.
