Tim Bollerslev is schedule for a seminar on Friday, December
8.  Unfortunately, his flight leaves IAH at 5:30 that afternoon so we
cannot have his seminar at the usual time.  We need to start it by 2:00.  I
thought your group might have an interest in seeing Tim although I don't
know yet what paper he is presenting.  So, you can pick the time:  10:00,
11:30, 12:00, 2:00 ...  We would like to accommodate your group if possible.

PS I heard you are definitely on for the Energy Risk Management course in
the spring.  That is fantastic.  We are all thrilled!  Thank you for making
this important contribution to the Jones School.  And, on that note, I will
send a letter tomorrow regarding the seminar funding.
