Helyette,

I m very sorry to disappoint you. I have just learned I have to be in Houston
during the
last few days of June and the first few days of July. A transaction is likely
to close, and I have to be available in case my services are needed.  I hope
it will not disrupt the planning for the conference too much.

I am leaving for Boston tomorrow: RISK2000 Conference, with Myron Scholes and
my boss, Jeff Skilling, speaking on the opening day.

I shall talk to Karla Feldman before my departure about the contract. I hope
we shall be able to close soon.

Vince
