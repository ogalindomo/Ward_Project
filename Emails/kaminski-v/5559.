Hi Professor Ronn:

I have ordered a flip chart and markers and an overhead projector.  

There were 11 pages in your presentation and they look fine.  We have 
already made the copies.

I believe everything is set - if you think of anything else, please let me 
know.

Enjoy your dinner tonight and we will see you tomorrow.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

There is one additional item I would request:  If the room does not contain
a blackboard or whiteboard, I would appreciate a flip chart and markers.

I am faxing you my Presentation Handout for tomorrow.  I would be grateful
if your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow's 11:30 a.m.
meeting; Vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30
range.  I will also bring along a "master copy" in case the trasmission
unduly mangles the fax.

Thanks,
Ehud
