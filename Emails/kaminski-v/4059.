Dear Vince:

How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
having been working for Williams for about two years,
now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
great company, I am wondering whether there is any
opportunity for me, either in research group or in
structure group

Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
and in charge of the quantitative research group with
7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
research and modeling about electricity,
load-following deal and tolling deals.

If you need any additional information, please feel
free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
hearing from you soon, thank you.

sincerely,
Charles
