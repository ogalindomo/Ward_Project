Andreas,
as we discussed today, I am sending you some information on how the positions 
and curves
are stored in our database. In the enclosed file you'll find the list of 
columns for 4 tables and
2 quarries as an example. 3 of these tables contain the positions 
information, 1 table has the curves information.

Ramesh (who supports our VAR model from IT side) will send you the 
description of these tables.

Regards,

Tanya.
