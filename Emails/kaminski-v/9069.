Dear Vince,

I just wanted to let you know that I'm working here for the summer.  I'm with 
CTG (Commercial Transactions) in the Industrial services group on the 30th 
floor.  I'm excited to be back at Enron and look forward to a great summer.  
I'm also happy to know that it is working out with the new members who have 
joined Research.  I hope you had a very nice Memorial Day weekend and an even 
better birthday.  Happy (belated?) birthday!

Warmest regards,
Van
