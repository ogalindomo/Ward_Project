Vince,

A quick update on job candidates:

1)  Nelson Neale:   relayed your request to Norman, and told Nelson that an 
offer is in progress.  Did not mention specific numbers to him.

2) Charles Shen:  left a message for him that we would get back to him next 
week with details of an offer.

3)  Interviewed by phone Tom Barkley at Thunderbird (brought to our attention 
by Enron recruiters there).   He looks very interesting so I am trying to 
schedule a visit to Enron for him.   He will finish T-bird in December (MBA) 
and has a bachelors with honours in Mathematics.


Have a great weekend.
