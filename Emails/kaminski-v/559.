Rice/Enron Finance Seminar Participants:

Luigi Zingales will present a paper co-authored with Raghuram G. Rajan, 
entitled "The Great Reversals: The Politics of Financial Development in the 
20th Century."? The full text of the paper is available in PDF form on the 
seminar website:

The baton for organizing the seminar series has been passed from Barbara 
Ostdiek to myself.? If you have questions regarding the series, please 
contact me (wangfa@rice.edu or 713-348-5404).

As we have done in the past, we will post the abstract and a downloadable 
version of the paper (if available) to the website a week or two before the 
seminar.? The website will also provide a link to the speaker's homepage so 
you can access his or her biographical information.? If the paper is not 
available at the website, I will send a hardcopy to interested Jones School 
faculty, to Felecia Jones (Economics), Sorin Sorescu (University of Houston), 
and Vince Kaminski (Enron). 

I will e-mail an announcement before each seminar, reminding you of the 
seminar date, time, and location.? The distribution list will include 
everyone that receives this e-mail.? Please let me know if you would like to 
be deleted from the mailing list or if you know of someone who should be 
added.
