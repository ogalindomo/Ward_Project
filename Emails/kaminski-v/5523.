Naveen,
as we discussed yesterday, I would like to see the results of Components VAR 
testing.
I got some from Sunil today for AGG-GAS. 
In addition if you can send me Component Var results for NG-PRICE for some 
date,
as well as NG positions, forward price curve, forward volatility curve for 
NG-PRICE-PRC for that
same date, I can verify the numbers.

Thank you,

Tanya.
