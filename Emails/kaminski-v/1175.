Vince/Stinson,

I met with Rebecca McDonald, and introduced her to Mr. Sud on Saturday.

The meeting went on quite well, and Mr. Sud repeated the point he had made to 
me regarding NTPC buying the power.  He did not ask for any consulting or 
other contract, but said that he would try to help.  

Rebecca seemed happy with the meeting, but I do not know whether she has a 
plan in mind going forward.

I can give you more details of the meeting if anyone is interested.  I do 
believe that Mr. Sud is well connected in India.

Regards,
Sandeep.
