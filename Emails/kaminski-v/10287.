Nadene,

I am located in Houston, EB1962. 

I can interview him on any day, except for Friday and Thu. 
I guess this leaves only Tue and Wed. 

I am available for 30 minutes,
6:30 p.m. Houston time (12:30 London time).
Our afternoons and early evenings will be very busy
for us this week.

Vince

Hi Vince,

I am trying to arrange an interview for the above.  Are you still in London?  
Rodney is available anyday this week between 11am to 1pm (London time)
which is 5am to 7am Chicage time).  Can you please let me know when you are 
available and what country you will be in so I can arrange it for you.

Many thanks
Nadene
