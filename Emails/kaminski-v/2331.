Happy New Year to all!

Don't forget to get registered early for this year's conference.  It
promises to be the best yet.  The fun stuff is already organized and the
program looks to be the best that "Trail Boss" Titman has yet produced.

Notice the "friendly encouragement" (translation discount in the
registration fee) for early registration.  The conference info and
registration form can be found at

Happy new year and hope to see you in San Antonio in April!
