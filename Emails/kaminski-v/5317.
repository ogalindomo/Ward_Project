Hello everyone:

Since we have so many new employees, Vince thought it would 
be a good idea for the Research Group to have an offsite social 
so that we might get to know each other better and to celebrate 
a great first half! 

WHEN:  Tuesday, July 11th
WHERE:  Ninfa's across the street.
TIME:  5:30 PM - 7:30 PM
WHAT:  Snacks, Drinks and Fellowship

More to follow - Mark your calendars!
