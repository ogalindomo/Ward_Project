Charlene Jackson, Managing Director of the Associate and Analyst Program.  =
I=20
wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team MDs and IT team members =
to=20
clarify any confusion surrounding Super Saturdays and technologist recruiti=
ng=20
for the Global Technology Track.   Although the Global Technology Track is=
=20
part of the Analyst and Associate Program - we will NOT be participating in=
=20
the Super Saturday events listed below.  Technologist candidates will be=20
brought into the office for a FRIDAY office visit. =20

Super Saturdays were first initiated for commercial Analyst and Associate=
=20
recruiting because many Enron representatives were not able to leave their=
=20
desks while the market was open during the workday.  Bringing candidates in=
=20
during the weekend works well in this situation because Enron representativ=
es=20
can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the=
=20
office.

However, many technology VPs have suggested that seeing Enron "alive and in=
=20
action" during the week would be a high selling point for technologist=20
candidates.    Therefore, we have opted to have Technology office visits on=
=20
Fridays.  The first three office visits are listed below:

November 10th
December 1st
January 19th

We will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more=

involved with technology office visits.  I apologize for any confusion. =20
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. 3-3589.

Thanks,

Subject: Super Saturday Changes

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=
nd=20
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01=
8=20
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will=
=20
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe=
r=20
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=
=20
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =
 =20
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=
e=20
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=
nd=20
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=
=20
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=
te=20
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=
=20
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=
l=20
rotate.=20
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of=
=20
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=
=20
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=
=20
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=
=20
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=
M=20
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=
ement=20
team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon,=

Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call fo=
r=20
dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each=

of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview=

at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp   =20
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who=20
attend the schools for which you are a team member).
We thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.
