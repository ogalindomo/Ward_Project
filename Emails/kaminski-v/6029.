Dear Project Sunrise Interviewees:

In order to complete gathering technical requirements, we will need to 
conduct some follow-up interviews.   I will be scheduling the interviews with 
all participants starting Wednesday December 6, 2000 to Monday, December 11, 
2000.  Tuesday, December 12th will be reserved for rescheduling of 
interviews.   

The interviews will be scheduled for 30 minutes and will be conducted by two 
members of the Project Sunrise technical team.   Before conducting the 
interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to 
determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to 
replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to 
limit your time commitment.  

Typical follow-up questions will be:   
What are your sources of data/information?  
Where is the data/information currently stored?  
Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.   

Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to 
the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.  
Please let me know your availability.  We will work around your schedule but 
would prefer to conduct the interviews 9:00 am to 2:00 pm to permit writeups 
to be done in the afternoon.  

Thank you very much for your participation and patience.
