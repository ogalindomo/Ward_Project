Dear all,

I have completed the cross-correlation study for the seven metals we have 
data for - will complete for gold, silver and cocoa.  I have also attached 
the spreadsheet.  Correlations based on log-returns, 21, 42 or 63 business 
days for either front month only or average of entire futures curve - please 
see data below or drill into spreadsheet.  We can choose the most appropriate 
time-bucket and whether to use front month or "average of curve" data.

Regards,

Anjam
