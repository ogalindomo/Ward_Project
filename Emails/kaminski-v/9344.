Steve,

I am tied up at the Power2000 conference.
I shall get back to you with my comments on Thursday morning.

I also want to talk to you tomorrow about finalizing the dates of the summer
rotations. We are talking to HR here about apartments, car rentals,
and other arrangements  for the London team for the summer. I promised
to give them the names and dates by the end of the week.

Sorry for the delay in sending you my comments.

Vince
