Shirley,
do you think we can get another room with better speaker phone?
Or, may be we can get better speaker phone?

Hi Tanya,

in my view it is very good if Stig and Kirstee are involved in your VaR 
meetings. Therefore, I think it is very useful for them to call Houston.

Could we get a little bit better equipment to allow them to hear everything 
well?

many thanks,

Slava

Hi Slava,

Kirstee and I find it useful to listen in on the VaR meetings in Houston on 
Wednesdays. 
However, it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical 
problem: we hear little or nothing at times. 
A possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install 
a "spider phone" in the VaR meeting room. 
What I mean is a phone similar to the one in the RAC morning meetings which 
have several remote speakers going out 
from the main phone (do you understand what I mean?). If this is done, we 
would  hear everyone around the table, 
not just those seated close to the phone. 

What is you opinion on 
A. us in  London calling in  to these meetings
B. getting some better equipment which would make it easier to follow the 
conversation ("spider phone" or  bigger speaker ..)

Please let me know what your thoughts are,

Best regards,

Stig
