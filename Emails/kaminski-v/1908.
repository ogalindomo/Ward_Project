Dear Vince,

Thank you very much for your e-mail and for acknowledging receipt of my 
package.
I am really excited about the opportunity to see you soon. I am available 
every
day at the first half of February, except for February 8 after 2 pm. (I will
give a presentation at the Southern Methodist University).

Please let me know if it is more convenient for you to see me in Houston and I
will be happy to fly there.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Valery
