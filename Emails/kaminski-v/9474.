Subject: VERY IMPORTANT - "change of telephone numbers" THIS WEEKEND !!!

As you are no doubt aware, THIS WEEKEND (22nd April 2000) the 0171 and 0181 
London dialling codes are being replaced by 0207 and 0208 respectively.   

Since our move to Enron House all external customers should have been made 
aware of the new 020 7783 telephone numbers.  
We are however still receiving calls on the old 0171 numbers.  

Please be aware that these 0171 numbers will be cease to operate on the 22 
April 2000.  

From this date, calls made to the old 0171 numbers will reach an announcement 
advising them to call Enron's new switchboard number: 020 7783 0000.

Please ensure that your external contacts are made aware of the correct 
number convention : 
020 7783 xxxx

Details of new phone and fax numbers are as follows :


Click here -->  <-- to access the Department Fax numbers details in the 
"Non-Commercial Bulletin Board" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.


Click here -->  <-- to access the Personal Fax numbers (Surname A-H) details 
in the "Non-Commercial Bulletin Board" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.


Click here -->  <-- to access the Personal Fax numbers (Surname K-Z) details 
in the "Non-Commercial Bulletin Board" database on ECTLON-LN2/ECT.

If you access the Enron network via 'RAS', you must ensure that the RAS 
number is updated in your laptop settings.  
The old RAS number was 0171 316 6666.  This has changed to 020 7783 6666.  


From the 22 April 00 Oftel's 'big number' day you will no longer be able to 
dial 0171 and 0181 numbers.  The new 0207 and 0208 numbers must be used in 
their place.  Current users of the new code will know that at present you 
must use the new area code as well as the new number.

From the 22 April 00 you will be able to dial either the local number on it's 
own i.e. 7783 0000 or the area code and local number i.e. 020 7783 0000.
