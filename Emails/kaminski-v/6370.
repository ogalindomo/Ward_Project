Just a gentle reminder that you have a conference call from10:00 AM to 10:30 
AM on Thursday, November 16, 2000, (during the Management Meeting) with Larry 
Lawyer and the Bear Stearns people to discuss CHIPS.  See Larry Lawyer at the 
Management Meeting for details regarding the call.  Shirley has a packet of 
information that Larry Lawyer sent over for your review.

Thanks.   Anita
