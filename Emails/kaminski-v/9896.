FYI. This is a deal I've been helping them value correctly. 
Here Remi is, ostensibly the head of trading in Brazil, and he doesn't even 
know what a digital option is.  Scary!

Thanks for taking the time to look at this transaction.  I'm currently trying 
to understand what a digital option is, but besides this I can say you've got 
it right.
