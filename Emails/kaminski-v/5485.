Chris,

Thanks for the invitation. The evening of July the 18th is fine  with me.

The list looks fine and it can be easily expanded, if the first set of
articles is well received. I shall prepare a list of topics that occupy us
every day and that we could write about without revealing the details of our
proprietary research.

Please, feel free to send the message from Lacima. I think that it's better
for us to sign the articles with our names, giving our respective
affiliations. In this way, Enron gets the credit, but not the liability if
there is any error in an article.

Hope to see you soon.

Vince
