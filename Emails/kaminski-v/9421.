Hi Vince,

Thanks for taking the time off to meet with me last week. I did enjoy
meeting you and your co-workers in the Research Group.

I do realize my background may not be the best fit for the type of work
done in your division. I'll be job hunting over the next several weeks,
and would really appreciate it if you could let let me know if something
opens up at Enron. Thanks again and best regards.
