Andrea,

We finished the the costless collar valuation. See the spreadsheets for 
details.

We checked the Bloomberg for volatility assumption. The 100 days volatility is
around 50%.  Since the option is for 3 years, the volatility should be 
somewhat smaller.
So we put an array of calculations, with the volatility ranges from 20% to 
60%.

If you have any questions,  please call me or Bob Lee.

Zimin
