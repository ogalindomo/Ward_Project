TFF Participants,

We are looking forward to seeing everyone in San Antonio this Friday.
Attached is a welcome letter that indicates the meeting room and describes
the two evenings (Friday dinner and tour of the Alamo and Saturday barbeque
dinner at a ranch outside of San Antonio).  We have arranged for five
horses for the brave at heart and a hayride for the interested so come with
jeans and boots.

See you Friday
