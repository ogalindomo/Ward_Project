Hello everyone:

Attached is the churn relocation request for some office exchanges within 
the Research group on the 19th Floor.  I have grouped them in sets of two
which are the exchanges.

This is a very RUSH order.  We would appreciate your getting to this as
soon as possible - the 15th of August would be great, if possible.

Let me know if there is something that you do not understand.  Thanks!

Shirley
