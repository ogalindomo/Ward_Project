Dear Tanya,

Thank you very much for the offer.

Basically, I can start at anytime if the condition is acceptable.

Currently I'm in the middle of a decision that I can extend my internship or
accept a job offer at here. But I think that decision should be done soon
since my original internship expires this week. So the exact time to start
work at Enron depends on how quickly I can get your official offer including
employment condition.

I hope this will help to your question. If you have any question on me, please
feel free to contact me.

Again, I appreciate your decision.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew
