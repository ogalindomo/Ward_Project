The Research Group:

It is with a deep sense of regret that I announce that Grant Masson will be
leaving the Research Group and Enron, effective today.

Grant has been a very important part of the Research Group's growth and
stability within Enron and he will be deeply missed.

We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with
all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I
will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and
Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An
announcement will be forthcoming at a later date.

Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".

Sincerely,

Vince
