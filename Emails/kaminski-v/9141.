Hi Louis:

We will have several employees from the London office coming to Houston
this summer (they will be rotating) beginning 7/31/00.  Can we get a parking
space at 777 Clay for them?  We only need one for 7/31/00 - 11/30/00 (4 
months).

The other alternative would be the stickers for Allen Center.  Do you still 
have
them?  

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw
