Steve,
in order to be able to test the New Credit Model as well as to answer Credit 
Group's 
questions regarding the outputs from this model Research needs to be able to 
do the following:

1. Run Credit Model independently of the other runs. It is quite OK for now 
to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios.
2. Debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time.

Please, let me know if your team can help us.

Tanya.
