Shelia Walton, HR, told me that my last day with my department will be June 
30.  Meanwhile I talked last week to EBS, EnronOnline, and EES.  I was most 
interested in the EES talk with Harold Buchanan who needs to know that he has 
the most complete list of potential customers and then information about 
those customers.

Any happenings from your talks?
