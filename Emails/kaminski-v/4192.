Thanks for your immediate response.
The problem seems to be the cost.

Iain , I have the smallest group but we are
 willing to pay what it takes for the copier.
On the other hand there may be other groups
that are larger and may not need the copier
as much and are not willing to pay the cost.

Seems to me,the copier is a necessity for the floor,
it would save not only time ,but money also 
in the long haul.

We have updated every possibility on the
32nd floor and this copier is needed for quick
presentations, meetings, etc.  and allows everyone
not to depend on color printers as much !

(Gives us choices)

Please after today , once we get together regarding
this matter , I will let Ina continue with the process,
whereby , I can continue focusing on what is best
for my group as well as the floor.

                                     Thanks
