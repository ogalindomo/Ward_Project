As a recent host on eSpeak, we'd like to get your comments on your event.  
Did you find it to be a useful communications tool?  If yes, how?  If no, 
what would you like to change?  We want to provide the best user experience 
possible, and your input is important to us. Please e-mail your comments back 
to me or feel free to call me at x39843.

Thanks in advance for your time and feedback.  We look forward to having you 
host another event in 2001.

Warm regards,
Sarah.
