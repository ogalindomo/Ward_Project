Mike:

We are currently being billed for Freese Notis Weather.  I will need to 
allocate these charges to the appropriate cost center.  If you would like to 
continue this service I could allocate it directly to your cost center or 
send you the bill directly.  If you know of anyone else who uses this 
application please let me know and I will split the cost among the 
departments.


Thank you,

Danielle Marcinkowski
