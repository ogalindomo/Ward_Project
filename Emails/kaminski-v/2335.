Vince,

Happy New Year to you and your family.

Under your leadership, I wish the research group will accomplish more in year 
2001.
We will work out more technically challenging projects (that distinguish 
Enron from the
competitions) and improve salesmanship ( that enhances our impact on Enron's 
business).

May year 2001 even better !

Zimin
