Stinson,

I have forwarded to you a phone message from John Blumer (EBS). John left a
message on my voice mail I did not quite understand.

Please, give him a call and see if we can help him. Maybe, we should just
refer the message to Louise Kitchen and let her handle John.

Sorry to burden you with this. Given time difference, it's difficult to
handle it from here.

I hope the operation went well without any complications.

Vince
