Dear Friends and Colleagues,

As strange or ironic as it may look, after three days of employment at TXU
Energy Trading, and after receiving a Red Carpet Reception by the management
of the company and the employees alike, I had to leave and come back home
due to personal reasons.  We are trying to restructure my relationship with
TXU ET, currently.
So, my contact info remains the old one - martin@electrapartners.com with a
phone number (404) 402-8957.

Regards,
Martin
