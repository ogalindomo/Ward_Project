Deal all,

Please find attached a copy from a presentation on UK inflation we gave this 
morning to John Sherriff, President & COO Enron Europe. It summarizes the 
results of our work on inflation so far. As you know the long term models 
still remain to be approved. As today is quarter end and there is a 
significant P&L effect on a MTM basis John Sherriff would like to proceed as 
soon as possible with the new curves. 

Thank you all for all your help!

Best regards,

Martina
