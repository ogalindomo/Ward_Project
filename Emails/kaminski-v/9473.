Great to hear that.  You are right, we should include Rho (done) and Theta 
(to do) for the cost term.

Zimin,

the model worked well today.  Hopefully it will continue the same in the 
future.

Do we need to make a similar change in the model to "Drift" to account for 
changes on the Demand Charges over time?
