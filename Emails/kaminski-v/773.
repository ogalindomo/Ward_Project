Hi Liz:

Vince has two expense reports pending for approval from Greg Whalley.

They are:  London Trip - 8,051.59
  Philadelphia (Wharton Business School) - 2,067.47

Please have Greg approve these as soon as possible.

The Wharton School will be cross-charged to Christie Patrick's cost center.
but for expediency in getting this paid it was submitted on our cost center.

Thanks!

Shirley
