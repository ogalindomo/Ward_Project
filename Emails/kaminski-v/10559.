Hi  Vince, Krishna & I talked to this student while were at Sycamore 
Networks.  He appears to be very qualified for our EBS Analytics group. 
Sycamore has a professional services team that provides consulting on network 
optimization modeling, etc. They do this to push their products, etc....  One 
of the professional in that group highly recommended this student. We are 
currently working with the same professional at Sycamore to perform our 
intial network design analysis (since the deadline was today!).   I have 
arranged for the MIT student's visit to Houston along with the two Standford 
students this month. I have handed over the task of arranging such visits to 
Elisabeth Grant. She will arrange everything and charge our RC so that we can 
allocate to John Griebling later.  Stinson and I think that is the most 
effective way of doing this.

Regards,

Ravi.

Hi Krishan, Ravi,

I apologize for the delay in mailing the writeups -- some unforeseen
complications completely shot the last 1-1/2 day. I am attaching PDF
versions of:

 1. The first two chapters of my thesis, which should help
    get a sense of what we are trying to do.
 2. Two more technical modeling writeups for services I am
    attempting to model.

The writeups are, as I mentioned before, works in progress, and
incomplete, and therefore I apologize in advance for confusions
that might arise. I also request that you not circulate these widely
for obvious reasons.

Thanks very much,
Salal
