Sir,

I have decided to accept your offer of employment here at Enron.  Please let 
me know how I can help with the "hiring-on" process.  May I ask what is the 
effective hire date?  That information will help me when I switch over from 
Prostaff. 

Thank you for this wonderful opportunity!

Sincerely,

Sam Smith
