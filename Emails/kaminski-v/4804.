We are in the process of placing our remaining new Associates as they are 
here for orientation and will be available for work August 28.  Ola has yet 
to be placed and I am inquiring if there is any interest in him joining one 
of your groups.  I know some of you expressed interest upon interviewing 
him.  If so , please advise as soon as possible.  If you have any questions, 
please contact me at 3-4584.  Thanks so much for your participation in the 
Associate Program!!
