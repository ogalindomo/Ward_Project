Dear Dr. Kaminski

This is Quentin Kerr again from Australia. As I mentioned brefore, my paper
will be ready soon. Please find out the attachment with the draft of my
paper (hasn't submitted yet). There are always some errors in my paper.
Please read it, give me some suggestions. Any comments will be appreciated.

By the way, I would like to ask you, have you received my resume? I sent it
to you about two weeks ago.

PS: attached with the pdf file.

Thanks
Quentin
