Vince, 

Here is our final draft for the model development report.  I believe that we 
have incorporated all your comments from the last meeting.  If you have any 
questions or would like to sit down and go over the report please feel free 
to call myself or patty.  If the report is OK or if there are some additional 
comments, I would appreciate if you would respond by Wednesday January 12.

Thanks

Andy
