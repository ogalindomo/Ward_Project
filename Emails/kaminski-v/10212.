Dear Vince,

Thanks for the interview with Enron.  I appreciated your time and the
conversation that we had together.  I really enjoyed my time at Enron and
believe that it is the type of company that I would like to work for.  More
specifically I enjoyed meeting the people in the research group and feel
that I could make a contribution and fit in well.  I look forward to
hearing from you or an Enron representative.

Sincerely,
Lance
