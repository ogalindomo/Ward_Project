 Vincent Kaminski,

You should have received a fax over the Labor Day weekend regarding our 
upcoming Sports Tournament.  If you did not receive it, please visit our 
website at www.houstonenergy.org and go to the "next scheduled event", or 
just go directly to http://www.houstonenergy.org/public/sportscover.doc. for 
all the information you need.  Hope to see you there and don't delay in 
sending in your registration!
