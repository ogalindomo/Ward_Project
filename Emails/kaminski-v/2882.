Folks,

 Those of you who have used UNIX are probably familiar with the grep command. 
It's used to extract lines from a set of files that contain a given input 
string, and is very useful. (If you have any questions on how to invoke it, 
ask me.) 

 The grep command is now available in a PC version -- see below.

Todd and Joseph,

As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been 
ported to Windows. I did some research and was able to find the Windows 
ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that 
contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any 
further assistance. Thanks.
