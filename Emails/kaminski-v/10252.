Good news. Kirstee Hewitt accepted the job offer. She will support RAC and 
Credit in London
and will help to close the gap that has recently developed due to involvement 
of Ben Parsons
in credit trading. She is very well qualified for this position and has a 
very nice personality.
We shall bring her to Houston for 6-8 week rotation to get her up to speed.
