Vince/Stinson,

This is a summary fo the report submitted by the Godbole Committee appointed 
by the state government to review the Dabhol project.

The report clearly suggests renegotiation on the tariff.  A lot of what they 
mention is something we won't agree to.  However, to me it seems apparent 
that this can be worked out.

Regards,
Sandeep.
