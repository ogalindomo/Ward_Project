Subject: real options openings?


Dear Vince Kaminski,
 I was auditing Prof Dyer's Real Options class on Thursday when you spoke
on Enron's activities in this area.  I would be interested in exploring the
possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
working in the development and application of real options methodology at
Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?

Thanks in advance,

Chris Kenyon
