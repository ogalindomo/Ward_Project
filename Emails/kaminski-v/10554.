Don't panic, but we have a new employee,  Chonawee Supatgiat, who is starting 
on Feb. 8th (yes, today).    Sorry about the short notice, but he just 
accepted on the 7th at 5 P.M.     He will be primarily supporting EBS (Enron 
Broadband Services) and reporting to Ravi, but we will need to find a spot 
for him on the 19th floor.   He can even use my office temporarily if needed 
since I have a desk on 44 as well.

I'll talk to you about the specifics in the morning.

thanks,
--Stinson
