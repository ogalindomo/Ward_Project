I am enclosing the copies of presentations I have reviewed over the weekend.
Please, take a final look at your sections. I have made no changes or minor 
cosmetic changes.

The overall presentation time is limited and we have to limit every presenter 
to a  maximum
time allocation of  5 minutes (strictly enforced). 

Vince

P.S. Mike, still missing the electronic version of your presentation.
