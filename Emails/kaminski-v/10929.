I am sorry to inform you that due to a scheduling conflict I cannot speak at

Subject: Energy conference



Vince:

I have attached a rough draft of the agenda with the topics being considered
for the conference.  It is being held in Washington, DC on June 19-20, 2000.
If your schedule allows, please join our speaking faculty.  You will notice
that the topic on "Forecasting and Measuring your Exposures to Energy Price
Risk" is not currently on the agenda.  We can add it once you have a chance
to check your schedule.  I also ask that you make recommendations of any
colleagues or industry professionals who can add expertise to the conference
as well.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me
at 212-661-3500 x3181.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you once
again for your time and assistance.
