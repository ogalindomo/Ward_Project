Kevin,

I am not sure by what date you require a color copier but if you can wait 
until April, Lanier has let me know that they ARE going to release their NEW 
22 Copy Per Minute color copier @ that time. Please look @ the attached 
spreadsheet and compare the cost with the $ 24 CPM Canon copier sent to you 
on 01/31/2000:


Let me know what you think.

    Thanks,            Iain.................
