Per our Monday meeting, the time line for completion of the "Phase I" 
forecasting project (Hourly System Load & Next Day Load) is as follows:  
 Aug. 15 - Sept. 15 (Data Collection)
 Sept. 15 - Oct. 15 (Modeling)
 Oct. 15 - Nov. 15 (System Development and Testing)
If any questions arise between now and the end of August, contact Barbara 
Dillard, but as of Sept. 1, I will be the Chicago lead for this and other 
forecasting projects and will be available to handle any questions or issues.

Best regards,

Mark Mixon
