GREETINGS FROM GARP!   WE ARE HAVING THE NEXT MEETING JANUARY 30th AT ENRON.  
TIME 6:30PM UNTIL 8:30PM 
You are invited to bring a friend with you, however you will need to RSVP.
 
Vince Kaminski will lead a discussion regarding volatility in the energy 
markets.  Refreshments provided.


In order to provide easy access to Enron's facilities and due to security 
concerns, GARP and Enron request that everyone RSVP.  A guest list will be 
given to security.  


RSVP to Rita Hennessy.  Her email address is:                        
rita.hennessy@enron.com


I would like to express my thanks, in advance,  to Mr. Kaminski  for leading 
our group in this informative discussion.  As many of you are aware, energy 
markets present some unique challenges to Risk Managers, and volatility is 
certainly one of them!


Look forward to seeing you on Tuesday night.


Regards,

Frank Hayden
Regional Director - GARP
