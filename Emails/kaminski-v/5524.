Hello everyone:
=20
Just when you get used to something it changes!

As you may have heard, Enron is implementing a new time entry system as par=
t=20
of the July 1 SAP implementation.  Time entry for the June 16th- 30th perio=
d=20
must be entered into SAP by 3:00 pm CST on June 30th.  As your Timekeeper, =
I=20
will assist with this process and ensure that we meet this very important=
=20
deadline.

I will continue to do the time sheets for the 19th floor and for Osman and=
=20
Samer.

Sam Smith and/or Kevin Moore will be responsible for the timesheets for the=
=20
weather group on the 32nd Floor. =20

Time can be entered in SAP in two ways:
? you can enter your time yourself using the new eHRonline feature; or,=20
? timekeepers can enter time on your behalf. =20

If you are unsure as to which approach you should use, please call me. =20
Please remember that all time for this period must be submitted before 3:00=
=20
pm CST, on June 30th.

For those of you using eHRonline:
First of all, congratulations on taking this next step toward Enron=01,s vi=
sion=20
of empowering the employee.  By using the new eHRonline feature, you are=20
helping Enron to realize the value in this SAP implementation.  Hopefully,=
=20
you too, will receive value from having instant access to your personal=20
information.

The new eHRonline functionality is:
? easy to use
? accessible through the Enron intranet at eHRonline.enron.com

Using this feature, you can not only enter your own time, but also maintain=
:
? your profile information (skills, education, and experience)
? home address
? phone numbers
? W-4 changes
? emergency contact information

Additionally, you will be able to view your individual pay advice and benef=
it=20
elections.

You will receive your personal ID and password via e-mail from SAP_Security=
=20
by June 22nd.  Because of the confidentiality of the information accessible=
=20
using eHRonline, it is important that you keep your ID and password=20
confidential.  If you do not receive your information by the end of the day=
=20
on June 22nd, please call the COE at (713) 345-4SAP to obtain your ID and=
=20
password.

The Apollo & Beyond team has teamed with EBS to deliver training on how to=
=20
enter time using eHRonline via EBS=01, new product EnronCast.  This tool is=
=20
available to you on your desktop.  You can access EnronCast at=20
www.enroncast.com and follow the instructions.

For those of you who need me to enter your time:
Attached is a manual time entry form that I must have completed and returne=
d=20
by June 28th.  Please estimate the last two days of the period as accuratel=
y=20
as possible.  If necessary, I can make corrections on the next time entry=
=20
period.  If you do not want to use this form, I will have hard copies at my=
=20
desk and will be glad to help you fill them
out.  I know this is creating more work for everyone, but what can I say?
