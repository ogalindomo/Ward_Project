Vince/Vasant:

Do you know who Todd Kimberlain is?  Is he supposed to be in the Research
Group and charged to our cost center?  He is.

I have never heard of him, but when you pull his name up, it shows that he
is reporting to Mark Tawny, but is in the Research Group and being charged
to our cost center.  

He is also on our time site, but I have not been doing his time.  I hope 
somebody
has!

Let me know,

Thanks!

Shirley
