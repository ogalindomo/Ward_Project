Please inform Henwood that Enron will renew the license for the Prosym 
software modules but will not renew the licenses for North American databases.
The software modules to be renewed are:
Base System (Prosym?) (ECOsym is included in the base system)
ASAP/MSTAT
MULTISYM
EMSS interface.

It is not 100% sure that the last module is required. Nevertheless, please 
begin the agreement amendment process asap.  I will let you know if there are 
modifications soon.

Thanks,
Grant.
