Hello Shirley,

I 'd understood from Yannis that he'd proposed a brown bag lunch where I'd
give a talk and then the discussion about various possibilities would
follow. I'm here until about mid-May and then will go on leave in Europe
for a year. I could be available to make trips back and forth from time to
time to get things started.

Best regards,
Joe McCauley
