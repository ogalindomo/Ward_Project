Hello everyone.  It is time for the Spring recruiting season to begin and 
select the candidates we would like to have on our pre-select list. My 
coordinator  will be handing out the resume books this morning. Please call 
Alyse at extension 57339 with your EB locations so we can be sure to get the 
resume books to you. Please email me your top 10 picks by noon, Friday, 
January 26th.  Thank you for your continued support and I look forward to 
working with you all this season.
