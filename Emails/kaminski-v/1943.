Vince, thanks for your very prompt email response. I passed your message 
along to Dave.

Thanks also for a great dinner and day of meetings last week. I really 
enjoyed the chance to learn more about Enron, and was very impressed with 
everyone I met.

Look forward to working with you these next few months!!

Cheers,
Vincent

Subject: Re: Enron Cover Letter & Resume for Dave Gershenson



Vincent,

I have forwarded the resume to our Analysts / Associate pool with
a recommendation to accept David as a summer intern.

I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
work for a different unit of Enron. It's up to him and I shall not be
offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination.

Vince
