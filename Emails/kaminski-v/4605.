Margaret, 

Please find attached file with average monthly prices for regions your 
requested. This file gives more information than the previous (yesterday) 
one. As the one before, source for this file is Megawatt daily, it includes 
On-Peak and Off-Peak prices and you can also see daily data that was 
converted to monthly average data. There are two types of averages prices: 
average and weighted average. Weighted average takes into account number of 
transactions of certain price.

For example: PJM had average price of $53.61 and weighted average price of 
$53.15 in August , it means that there were more transactions of lower price 
than higher.  Also, Megawatt Daily has its own methodology and I am attaching 
it with this message. 

If you have any questions regarding prices or methodology, please contact 
Sevil Yaman (5-8083) or me (3-4305).

Sincerely, Elena
