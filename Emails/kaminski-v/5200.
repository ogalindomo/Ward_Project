Dear Joel,

Will be glad to help out but had a look at the Stream 2 on Monday 
and it is 1120am-520 pm covering three sessions !!!

Could I suggest that I take the 1120am-Lunch session and you can find another 
speaker(s) from Day 2 
to chair the afternoon session(s).

I am flexible if you need me to take a different time on the Monday.

Rgds Raymond

Raymond,
By the way, is there any chance you could chair a session at  the conference?
Glenn Labhart from the US has unfortunately dropped out so I  am hoping you
could chair Stream Two on Day One (Monday 17th). Please let me  know asap. It
would be a great help is you're available.
Best  wishes,
Joel.
