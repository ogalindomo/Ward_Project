Ronnie,


regarding the parking situation downtown 
The closest parking garage with visitor parking is the one at Allens Center.  


your agenda, to define
- what the scope of the project is
- what do you expect of the project -- in other words what are you trying to
find out from the study, this will help define the scope
-discuss a timeline
-tools that we can use at Enron
-are there any projects at Enron (past or present) that we can draw on or
build on

sounds good.  Do you all have the original scope Vince wrote up?  Although it 
is broad, its a good beginning for your scope.  Once you flesh-out the scope, 
we'll see if any existing reports can be found that may be helpful.
