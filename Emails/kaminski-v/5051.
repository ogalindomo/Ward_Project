Nick,

Vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you August visit to Enron.   
Vince and I are free almost any date except August 14 and 15th,  but we would 
like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other 
key EBS executives such as Kevin Hannon and perhaps Ken Rice and John 
Echols.    If you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates, I 
will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals.   

By the way, Giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good 
impression on everyone he has worked with.  It's been a real pleasure having 
him here for the summer.

Regards,

Stinson
