Dear Molly:

Happy New Year! Haven=01,t talked to you for a while,
hope you and your family had a great holiday. I can=01,t
believe we are already in 2001!

I remember we had talk last December, and you were
basically waiting for the response from Vince, have
you heard anything back from Vince yet? Since we are
already in January, I really hope we can move forward.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me
at 918-409-4308. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Charles
