Kevin,

I am helping Doug for building a model to price power spread options he saw
in the market. This includes  power capacity, transmission, heating rate 
options, etc. 

I do not have the access to the power curves in  M:\power2\Region  as I used 
to.   
I need your permission to regain  the read-only access to the curves.   

Thanks in advance.
