Dear Vince,

Thank you very much for your e-mail. I am very excited about the opportunity y
to see you soon in Dallas. Any week day, in general, and Fridays, in 
particular,
is convenient for me. Please let me know what day might be convenient for you.

I look forward to hearing from you and to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
