We have identified two good candatites who would be available for a London 
interview the week of the 18th:

1. Kerryn Hawke
2. Stephen Cusack

also strong but not available for that week is

3. Piero Chessa (working for ECMWF in Italy)

we have a couple others here in the states if the London interviews don't 
work out.


I am forwarding under separate cover Kerryn and Stephen's CV's with telephone 
numbers to Jen
