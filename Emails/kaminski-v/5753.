In response to customer feedback and in order to make our website more user
friendly, PJM will add buttons for the more widely used eTools to the PJM home
page. The button will be located just under the weather maps and will 
eliminate
the user's need to scroll or make multiple clicks to reach the  suite of PJM
eTools.  The entire suite will continue to be accessible via the "Business
eTools" link on the navigational bar. The new buttons should be available on
Thursday 12/14/00 at approximately 3:00PM.
