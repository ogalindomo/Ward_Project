Dr. Kaminski:

Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me about my
electricity model when you visited Carnegie Mellon. (I was the PhD
student in Finance who had a two-factor model for pricing
electricity. My model incorporated strategic behaviour and varying
price elasticities across different consumers of electricity). While here,
you mentioned the possibility of further developing my model at Enron.
One avenue you suggested was through the summer internship program at
Enron. If this is still an option, I would very much like to talk with you
or one of your associates about working with or at Enron on my model.

I can be reached by phone at (412) 683-9085.


Sincerely,
