Sandeep,
?
Below, I have summarized Henwood's work on the  India database to date. 
?
The "Inter_Regional Links.ppt" file shows the  topology and links between 
bubbles in the our model and  "Expand_India_Data_011000.xls" details the 
existing station information that we  have compiled to date.?Total resources 
closely match reported resources as  shown in "L&R_0110.xls". Reported India 
total in 1997 is 86,000 MW and that  in the Henwood database is 84,000 MW 
through 1997.
