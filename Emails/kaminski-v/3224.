Could all of you please give access to your calendars (Lotus Organizer) to 
Anita DuPont, and also make sure that if you step away from your desk that 
your calendar indicates where you will be?  It has happened a few times 
recently that people have come for appointments and the person has been away 
from his/her desk and Anita could not get hold of the person.  This does not 
portray a good image of the group.  Also, if you have cell phones, please 
make sure Anita has the number.

Also, please make sure to complete your self-assessment performance review, 
and either indicate list of projects worked on since June in there or at 
least separately e-mail me a list.

Thanks,
 Vasant
