Ted Murphy would like to have Jason removed from his cost center 
effective  December 16th.  Vince said that it would be ok to have him 
added to our cost center, effective that date.  He is not supposed to start 
with the Research Group until the 28th, but needs a home from the 16th to 
the 28th, so we will pick him up.

Can you take care of this?

Thanks!
