Good morning Mr. Giancola:

Your resume was forwarded to Vince Kaminski, Managing Director and
Head of Research with Enron.  

We would like to bring you in for an informal interview at your convenience.
This would be for a position of "Economist" or "Associate Economist",
reporting to Maureen Raymond Castaneda.

Please give me some dates and times that would be convenient with you
and I will have our HR Rep contact you to schedule your coming to Houston.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Research Group
