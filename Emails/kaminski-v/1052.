We have conducted an interview and written the attached article for the 
upcoming edition of the EnCounter, the Associate & Analyst Programs' 
newsletter.  The interview was conducted with Shalesh Ganjoo in regards to 
his participation with the implementation of storage capacity as a 
commodity.  

To ensure our publication is printing the most accurate information, I have 
attached the article for your review.  Please confirm that the information 
provided from Shalesh Ganjoo is accurate.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,
