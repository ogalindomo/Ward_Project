Habiba,
Thanks for this, but I haven't heard a peep out of them yet, and I'm  
concerned since the book and cover are going to print in about a week.? Is  
it possible for me to contact them?
?
Thanks,
Julie

Julie,

I have forwarded your e:mails and information  to London.? They now have
responsibility for this project and they  would be making the necessary
decisions.? I have given them your  contact information so that they can
coordinate efforts with  you.

Thank you.
Habiba
