Thanks for the referral on this matter. We want to be the best and honor our 
affirmative action and accessibility responsibility to all people, so we plan 
to satisfy at least the Priority 1 points in the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines put out by the World Wide Web Consortium. In addition, we will 
continue to monitor and improve as we develop new tools. Thanks again
Have a good weekend!
