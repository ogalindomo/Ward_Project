Vince, I hope you are well.

A question if I may.

I noticed that EBS's allocation for 2001 from the corporate research group's 
budget was $1.44m. Could you please give me an 'heads-up' on what I can 
expect for the dollars - in terms of people, on-going projects, anticipated 
work-program. I'm aware that Stinson in our point person, but I've seen him 
for a long while. A breakdown/schedule would be great.

I appreciate your help.

Thanks.

Barry.
