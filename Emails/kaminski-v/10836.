Vince,

Thanks for the note - and congratulations on yours as well.  

I haven't had too much to do yet with the research guys here as they're 
pretty much self directed.  Once a week (Thursday AM) I've started a joint 
project update meeting with Structuring and Research.  I hope this way the 
Structuring team can bounce quantitative issues off Research and the Research 
guys can stay closer to the commercial deals.  

- Dale
