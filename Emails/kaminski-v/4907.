Hey guys,

Further to our meeting, here (courtesy of John T) are the addresses to view 
the peaker data for our upcoming testing: 

a. O:\_Dropbox\PeakerData\Peakers1999.htm
b. O:\_Dropbox\PeakerData\Peakers2000.htm

At the present time, these pages display on Microsoft Internet Explorer only. 
Type in the above URLs in the address area of your IE. The pages refresh 
automatically once every minute.  

Cheers, --Scott
