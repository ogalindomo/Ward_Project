Mark:

I enjoyed our meeting last Tuseday very much and I look forward to calling 
you again in a week or so. I think your idea of having me present to several 
senior Enron executives including Koenig and, perhaps, Jeff Skilling is very 
good.

I discussed this a bit with Vince Kaminski on Thursday as well and he 
expressed a strong interest in attending the meeting as well.

Regards,
