Hi guys,

it was nice to work with each of you for the last couple of weeks. It was 
great time and I enjoyed every single day here.
I am very much impressed with research team in Houston and looking forward to 
strengthen our co-operation even further.

Have all great time and not a very hot summer.
hope to see all you soon.

many thanks,

Slava
