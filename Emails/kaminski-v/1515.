Avistar has been installed globally to provide desktop conferencing.  
Hardware and installation charges have been allocated by invoice to the 
relevant location.  The schedule below lists by Business unit and RC the 
number of units and charges allocated.  IT will assume the monthly charge-out 
process.

The allocated dollars will be depreciated over a three year period to your 
respective Cost Center beginning February 2001.

If you have any questions please feel free to call or e-mail, Sheila Glover, 
3-3210, or Paige Cox, 3-5428.
Thanks. Sheila
