Hi, Mr. Kaminski:

How are you?

I am back to school for the new semester now. I am in contact with Molly
Magee for my travlling schedule to Enron.

I got from GARP that you chaired a seeesion on Energy Risk at the New York
Conference last week. If it is not too much trouble, could you please send a
copy of your presentation to me? I appreciate it.

See you soon!

Frank
