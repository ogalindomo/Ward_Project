Zimin,

I mentioned your model to Anjam. I think the virtual storage product
they have in London is a perfect application for you model.

Vince and Stinson,

Anjam and Natasha called about modeling of virtual storage in UK.
The gas desk has a model built from crystal ball.  They are eager to see
if they can apply the storage model we developed here.  At certain
point, it may be useful for me to visit the London office.
