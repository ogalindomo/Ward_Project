Good morning all:

I don't know where this request should go, would you please direct me in
the right direction?

Conference room EB 19C1 has one whole wall that is a white marker board.
We would like to see about having a wall like this installed in 19C2.  Please
let me know the costs and time involved.  Vince Kaminski has approved.

Thanks and have a great day!
