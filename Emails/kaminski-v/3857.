Vince and I have been working along those lines and have narrowed the search 
to (1) Scripps Institution of Oceanography, (2) Lamont-Daugherty Earth 
Observatory, and (3) COLA - Center for Ocean, Land and Atmosphere.  We have 
contacted the principles at each of these institutions, made on-site visits 
to the facilities, and verbaly explored preliminary research program 
proposals.

Perhaps we could meet next week to coordinate this effort.
