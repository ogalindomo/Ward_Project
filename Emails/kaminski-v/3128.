Shirley:

Just a reminder that I had requested time-off on Tuesday, November 21, 2000, 
to attend a school function that I attend every year for a little friend of 
ours.   I know you will be on vacation but Leann will be here to help Vince 
or any of the rest of the department.  I would not normally take off when you 
are gone, but this is really important to Riley and I hate to disappoint 
him.  His school has Grandparents Day the Tuesday before Thanksgiving every 
year.   He does not have Grandparents that can attend so he has always asked 
my husband and I to come as his Special Friends. Usually, Al could just go 
alone but as you know he is in Hawaii taking care of his father and will not 
be here tomorrow.   I have worked enough extra hours to cover the time I will 
be off (9:00 AM to 1:00 PM or 1:30 PM).   I appreciate your consideration and 
thanks in advance if we can work this out.
