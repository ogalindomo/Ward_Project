 The Research Group is a unique and extraordinarily valuable organization for 
Enron.  The success of the group has led to widespread recognition of Enron's 
leadership in quantitative finance as it relates to the energy markets.  
Therefore, it is with great mixed emotions that I announce my resignation as 
I move on to the next phase of my career.

 I have enjoyed getting to work with each of you and wish you continued 
success for the future.

Highest regards,
Kevin Kindall

PS:   Comments, question, and anecdotes will be addressed in Thursday's
