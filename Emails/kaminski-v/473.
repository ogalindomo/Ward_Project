Hi guys,

Vince talked with Christie and they both are available next Tuesday (game 
day) at 9 am.  Can you meet then to start preparing an outline?

Also would you be up for a presentation at the research group's lunch meeting 
next Thursday?  Vince will be out, but you'll undoubtably get some 
interesting questions from others at the meeting, if your up for it.  Let me 
know soon, and we can schedule you for next Thursday.

talk to you later
