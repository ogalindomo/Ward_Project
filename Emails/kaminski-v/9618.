Nick:

We are unable to get a VC location for 10:30 AM, however, we can have one 
at  11:00 AM. Houston time.  Is there anyway that we could push the interview 
to 11:00 AM?  I know you have to make reservations for your conference room
also.  If not, we will have to do a phone interview.

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Nick,

We may have problems getting the VC location in Houston on  short notice.
We are currently on stand-by. We shall default, if we have no other choice,
to a phone interview.
