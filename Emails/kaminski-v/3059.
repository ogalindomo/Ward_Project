Vince,

Your note looks good to me, short and to the point.  

I assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with Dale.  I would 
want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model 
AND database for North America.  Unless a familiarity with the short term 
model is a prerequisite, I doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on 
it.

Depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term 
model, it might be helpful to have access in both Omaha and Houston?

We would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need 
for testing the model.  Steve Hotte, CIO for ETS, would co-ordinate the 
in-house installation for us.  At some point, it will be helpful to get Steve 
in contact with the appropriate MarketPoint IT rep.

Assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues, Dale should 
probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review. 

Let me know what I should do next.
