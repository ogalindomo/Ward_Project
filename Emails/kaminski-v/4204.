Zimin,

Andrea Reed asked for our help in looking for end-users of steel which might 
be used to take a commodity hedge position.    She will work on identifying 
potential equities or indices which might be used, and then we will analyze 
them for correlation or co-integration with steel prices.   Andrea should be 
contacting you next week regarding the project.     Hector has done 
co-integration analysis in the past and has the tools to do this project.

Thanks,

Stinson



Anrdrea:   We will also need you to identify which steel prices/indices 
should be used in this analysis.
