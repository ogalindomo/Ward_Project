 I am forwarding it to Vince for his approval.  It looks good although I have 
three questions:
1) I presume that it is clear that Enron pays housing up to 1500/month.  
Anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with.Utility bills are not 
included unless part of the rent, right?  This should be clarified; as you 
know, Houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket-book.
2) Economy class plane.  Can we even do that?  I thought Enron policy was for 
a B-class ticket for flights over 6 hours.
3) 500lbs of transport.  I don't know if this is a big ticket item, but I 
would give him less, 250 say, if it would save Enron considerable expense.

Regards,
Grant.
