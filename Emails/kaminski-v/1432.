Please find attached a revised announcement and call for papers for the 5th
ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REAL OPTIONS: THEORY MEETS PRACTICE. The
conference is co-organized by the Real Options Group and the Andersen
School, at UCLA, Los Angeles on July 11-14, 2001. The submission deadline
is MARCH 2 (and registration is by April 20). Travel allowances are
provided for all academic presenters (and fees are waived for all
