Everyone,

Several of us have talked about starting an ongoing meeting that we can use 
as a platform to discuss various transmission issues.  

I invite everyone to our first meeting, I have received names from several 
different sources for the invitation list.  If any of you feel that others 
should be present please let me know.

Vince has agreed that the research group will sponsor this activity and our 
first meeting is scheduled for Friday, December 8th.,  from 11:30 - 1:00. 

Please RSVP to Anita Dupont whether or not you will be able to attend and 
your lunch preference for sandwiches or salads.  Anita's extension is 30329 
and her e-mail is adupont@enron.com.

Regards,
Lance
