Kevin/Karin:

My understanding from Vince is that London is reponsible for the expenses 
incurred while their people are here for training, as well as for any of our
people that go to London at their request.

It should be easy for them to expense this airfare for Steve from their office
and charge it to whatever cost center Tony is going to be under in London.

Kevin

With regards to Tony's airfare ticket, which has been put onto Steve Leppards 
credit card as Tony hasn't got an Amex yet, could you please let me know who 
is responsible for payment?  I guess it is your costcentre, if so please 
supply me with the number.

Thanks

Karin
