Dear Vince,

we have just received the signed confidentiality agreement. According to
the terms in the agreement, I am sending you an attachment with the pdf
file of the paper discussing the valuation of collateralized debt. We
would be glad to discuss further about a possible collaboration at your
convenience.

Please let me know if you have any trouble deciphering the attachment.

With best regards,
Stathis
