What do we need to know to make EBS a successful business?

We need to identify 5 to 10 critical issues in order to help M.I.T. professor 
Gabriel Bitran get his students focused on areas of interest to EBS.


Your suggestions for interesting and useful research topics are due by next 
Wednesday morning, May 31.   Tom Gros will then forward the topics to 
professor Bitran.

P.S.

I really need your help on this.
