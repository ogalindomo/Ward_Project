Hello everyone:

In doing the SAP timesheets this time I have discovered there are several
people listed in the 105896 Cost Center - ORG. Unit #1424 (Research) that
are no longer in the Research Group.  Shouldn't they be moved?

They are:

Alexios Kollaros 502373  Now with the new Power Co.
Farouk Lalji  501609  Analyst rotated out 
Ainsley Gaddis  400250  Summer Intern returned to School (last day the 11th)
Mandeep Chahal 502876  Now with the new Power Co.
James Aimone  514849  Summer Intern returned to School (Last day the 11th)
Roman Zadorozhny 501778  Now with another co. in Enron

Please let me know if I need to do anything.

Thanks!

Shirley
