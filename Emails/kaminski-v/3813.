Nick,

I shall be in Palo Alto late in November, closer to Thanksgiving. I am on the
road today and I shall E-mail you tomorrow, when I get back to the office,
with the details. I spoke to Stinson over the phone today about closing the
loop on funding. I shall check into it tomorrow. The paper workk should be
taken care of by the end of the week.
