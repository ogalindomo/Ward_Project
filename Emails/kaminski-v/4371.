Vince, Anita and Kevin: 

I went to the dentist yesterday afternoon, and unfortunately, I am going to
have to have some oral surgery.

It is scheduled for 9:30 AM on Thursday the 21st of September, so I will 
probably 
be out the rest of the day.  Hopefully, I will return on Friday, the 22nd if 
all goes
well.

Just wanted to let you know.

Thanks!

Shirley
