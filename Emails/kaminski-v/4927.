Stinson,

How about Monday, August 21st or Monday, Aug. 28?

Mondays are especially effective, because I would like to
come on Saturday and work over the weekend together with
Giuseppe before the meetings on Monday.

I'm very happy to hear that. He is also very excited to be there working with
your team!
