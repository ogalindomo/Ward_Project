Vince,

Last Monday, I sent the VP's an e-mail asking for their help (from them, or 
from one of the people working with them) in providing a Technical Corner 
article by today.  To date, Sandeep and Mike have responded but cannot do one 
for this coming week.  I didn't get a response from the other three.  Do you 
have something that could be easily adapted for the Monday issue?

And, any suggestions about how to motivate a VP would be appreciated.  My 
usual approach is to ask politely, which usually gets a positive response.  I 
know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work, but surely as 
much as our people like to publish their ideas, one person out of 
forty-some-odd would be able to do something in a week's time, right?

As always, I appreciate your help.  And, if you would care to share some 
advice on how I can do this in a better way, I will always listen and learn.

Sam
