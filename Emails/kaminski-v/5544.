Thanks Susan:

However, Vince has not received his Financial Times at all this week.  I have
called everyday and they tell me they will send a recovery copy, but so far
we have not received one.  Is there anyway we could get a copy for him
today? 

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Shirley,

Please find the below answers to the questions you had sent to Judy.

Financial Times - Vince's subscription does not exprire until January 4, 2001
Vince's subscription to Power Finance & Risk - What you recieved was not a 
renewal, it was for a free trial that began on June 5th and ends on June 26.  
Please disregard it.  His subscription that we recently renewed does not 
expire until March 26, 2001.
I have sent in payment for Vince's renewal for Oxford Energy Forum.

If there is anything else that I can help you with, please do not hesitate to 
call me.

Susan
