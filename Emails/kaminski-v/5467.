Sounds like fun - be careful and have a great time.  We will see you when
you return on the 31st.

Subject: I'll be gone for a month  

Good morning:

I am leaving Houston this weekend to go to camp, so Friday June 30 will be my 
last day. I will be at camp for a month, but I can be back at work on Monday 
July 31.
