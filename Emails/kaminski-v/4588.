Dear Vince and Grant,

I am currently reviewing some of the more erecent references on EVT and its 
application. I get back to you shortly with some points regarding the 
usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from 
EVT. 

Cheers,
Christian

Christian:

To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context 
of Value at Risk calculations.  We have not looked at EVT for power, because, 
to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of 
price excursions: i.e. given tomorrow's load forecasts and expected plant 
dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how 
the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested 
in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however.  As far as the 
weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level.  
Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the 
weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.

Cheers,
Grant.
