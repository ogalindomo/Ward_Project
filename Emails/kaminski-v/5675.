Hello Celeste:

Plans are in the works to rotate Roy Ibasco from the Research Group into 
Henry Arora's group.  Vanessa Carranza is handling the churn request.  I am 
not sure of the rotation date, but we need his desk by the 15th for Gwyn 
Koepke.

You probably already know all of this, but just in case.
