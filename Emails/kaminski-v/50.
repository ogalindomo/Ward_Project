Hi Vasant,

 How are you?  Sorry to hear that you are getting swamped with work.

 I am doing my best to spend time with the Enron Credit team to learn about 
their current (public firm) models.  In addition, I have begun to review 
various econometrics approaches that may be applicable to the private firm 
models (PCA, PLS, Cluster analysis, etc.).  Also, at the suggestion of Vince 
and Slava, I am trying to work on the overall "strategic plan" (aka the 
Duffie document).

 Amitava suggested that we might want to have a conference call on Tuesday 
with Bryan, Markus and Vince to get an update on their ever changing strategy 
and data needs.  Amitava said that he would ask Anita to coordinate this 
conference call.

 Let me know if there is anything else you would like for me to do while I am 
here.

Take care,
Iris
