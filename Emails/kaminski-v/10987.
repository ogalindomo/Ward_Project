Hello ,
We are still in need of Flat Screens.
We need two for Trisha Tlapek and two for Michael Sergeev.
Their locations are EB3132B and EB3131B.

We have been waiting for these screens for some time now.
Will you please provide me with the E.T.A.

                                                 Thanks
                                              Kevin Moore
