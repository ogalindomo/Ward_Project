Jana,

It would be great to see both of you again. 

What about Friday evening (tomorrow) or sometimes next weekend (March 25 - 
26th)?
I heard many good things about  "American Beauty."

The rest of this coming weekend does not look good.
I am leaving for California (business and a few vacation days in the Napa 
Valley)
on Sunday and I have to finish a few thing before I leave.

I got your fax  re the 10th anniversary party and will attend. My assistant 
should have responded 
by now.

Hope to see you soon.

Vince

Vince,
How are you?  Did you have a good trip to California?

I just got back in from Atlanta and DC.  Both meetings were very good, and
although I was only in DC for a day, it was beautiful weather and the cherry
blossoms had started to bloom.

I wanted to see if you would like to go see "American Beauty" with us,
sometime soon.  David wants to see it again, before the Oscars.  Let me know
when you have some free time.

Also, did you get my fax re the 10th anniversary party of natural gas futures
trading?  If not, I will re-fax it.

Hope all is well.

Jana
