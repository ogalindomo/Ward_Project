Just wanted to let you know that I have done some preliminary, high level, 
research into this commodity and would be glad to share it.  Please let me 
know if you would be interested in it.  Thank you.

Nelson,

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just 
wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in 
Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  
Please let me know.  Thank you.
