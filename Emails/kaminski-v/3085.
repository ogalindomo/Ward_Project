 Per our conversation yesterday,  I will have a job description for the Comp 
Finance students sometime today.  I have also gone through the MBA resume 
stack yet again.  The person who requested the phone interview is Troy 
Mischke.  He works for Pratt & Whitney in Florida.  CMU has a Flexmode 
Program, which is another phrase for distance learning.

 It turns out that there are a number of people that work for Pratt & Whitney 
in Florida.  My guess is that they all know each other, and decided to take 
the Flexmode Program together.  Here are the names

 Tony Garcia
 K. Todd Kuykendall
 Timothy Leonard
 Troy Mischke

 Only Troy requested the phone interview, although Tony Gacia did send a 
cover letter.  What is the best path forward?
