Vince,
It was a pleasure talking with you earlier today. Please read the documents I 
have attached with this email. Let's talk in the near future to continue our 
conversation. I am very confident that my team and I can be successful 
regarding any staffing need you have.? I will give Sheila in HR a call and 
see if we can work out a contract. Please visit our web site for up-to-date

Sincerely, 

Johan Dahl
