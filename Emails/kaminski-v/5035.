Thank you for your interest in EnronOnline.

The  following  is a guest password that will allow you temporary view only

In  order  to  apply  for transaction status with EnronOnline, your company
needs to complete a Password Application and Registration Form for a Master
User  account.   Each  Master  User will be able to grant various levels of

To obtain a Password Application and Registration Form, you can visit our
website at www.enrononline.com and select the "How to Register" link, or
call our HelpDesk at 713/853-HELP (4357).   Alternatively, you may click on
the attached documents, complete the forms, and fax to 713-646-8511.

Just a reminder, in order to access EnronOnline, Shockwave needs to be
installed.  The Shockwave installer can be found within "About EnronOnline"
on the home page.  After opening "About EnronOnline", using right scroll
bar, go to the bottom.  Click on "download Shockwave" and follow the
directions.  After loading Shockwave, shut down and reopen browser (i.e.
Microsoft Internet Explorer/Netscape).

We  hope you will find that EnronOnline provides an easy and more efficient

online.
