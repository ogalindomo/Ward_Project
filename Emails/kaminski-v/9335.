Steve,

I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studies
computer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me. Computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of 
spare capacity on their systems.

But we can always try. We shall take this idea, to the person in EBS 
responsible for the 
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details.

EBS is dying to come up with some new products.

Vince

Vince, Stinson

Have any investigations been made of the issue of trading (spare) processing 
power?  Such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth 
business, since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around, as 
would their results.

Obvious technical and legal problems are:
1.  Standardisation.  (Java?)
2. Security and confidentiality.

Just a thought that's been buzzing around my head for a while.

Steve
