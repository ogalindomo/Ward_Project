Hi Michelle,
Chris, Helen and I met this afternoon and discussed about
the project.  We think the following course of action is appropriate.
The model interface will be in Excel Spreadsheet, with most
of the inputs (from Enron as well as from the consultant) hiding
in an Access data base. The Access data base can be update
when needed. The engine will be written in Visual Basis code and
be linked to Excel through xll (or dll). 

Helen has been discussing with Ken about various
aspects of the model and will finalize the Access data table
form with Ken. In the mean time, Helen and I will start working
on code this Thursday (she will be in training Wednesday). 

Best,
Alex
