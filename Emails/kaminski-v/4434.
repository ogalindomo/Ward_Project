Hello Mr. Roberts:

Vince Kaminski will be arriving in London on Monday, the 18th of September 
at 9:55 AM.  He would be available to meet with you in the afternoon on the 
18th.

Please let me know if this is acceptable and who the individuals are that 
will be attending the meeting.  You also mentioned an agenda, which would 
be great.

Thanks!
