Hi Vince.
I spoke with Molly McGee down in HR- we are getting the paperwork together.
I will send you those candidates we talked about next.
********************************************************
Just to let you know why I contacted you...

Every Student at the better universities including those in the UK- ask 
either for you or Enron.

I saw Enron was voted the BEST company to work for out of 10 in the world 
andthere are countless articles in the Financial Times on Enron. For this I 
am thankful to know you now!
********************************************************
Did you know why my grandfather changed his name from Wesloski to 
Wesley?...When he came from Poland to work as an autoworker in 
Detroit...there was alot of anti-polish sentiment and he was beaten and 
intimidated to the point where he was afraid for his life and the saftey of 
the family. He then changed the name to the English derivative from WESLOSKI 
to "Wesley". Nevertheless, they kicked his teeth out of his mouth and beat 
him senseless many times. I may change it back...I don't know.

OK- I will get everything together for you and Molly!
Thank you for the opportunity to work with you Vince and Enron.

Thank you,
Jeff
