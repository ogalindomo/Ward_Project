Hello Vince,

How are you this week?

My week is pretty relaxing - I am taking the training for the very last
product of my company, called Voicenet, and I will achieve the highest state
of initiation with Destia (Viatel) products, ha...

Unfortunatelly I have not been promoted for Business VIP Representative (the
position associated with T-1) as I do not have any experience with it.

I am blaming myself because I cannot discipline myself to study consequently
every day for GMAT.

All the best to you and see you on Saturday.

Patrycja
