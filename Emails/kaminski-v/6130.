Subject: Electronic Newsletter Deadline

Thank you for getting on board and helping make the ENA electronic newsletter 
a success.  We look  forward to receiving your "Business Highlights" and/or 
"Nuggets & Notes" for the upcoming newsletter.  The newsletter will not go 
out this week because of the Thanksgiving Holiday.  We do plan on sending one 
the following week.  The deadline for the next newsletter is noon, Wednesday, 
November 29.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Michelle Vitrella & Kathie Grabstald
