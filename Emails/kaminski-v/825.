I would like to take this brief opportunity to thank you all for inviting me 
to visit Enron.? The day was extremely interesting and educational for me and 
I was extremely impressed by the people and environment Enron had to offer.

I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity in the near 
future. 

Sincerely, 

Michael Gorman
