Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself.  I currently work with Christie Patrick and 
Michael B Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with you 
and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case study.  
Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few convenient 
times that work with your schedule.  I will work with our management and do 
my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews that fit with your 
outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with: Ken Lay - chairman and CEO, Jeff 
Skilling - president and COO, and Andy Fastow - CFO.  If you feel that you 
may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to work 
something out the same day, so you don't have to travel back here.  I will 
forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once the 
interviews are scheduled.  Do you anticipate drafting specific questions?  If 
so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you and I hope that we can touch base 
very soon.

Regards,


Cindy Derecskey
