I know you're very busy, so you might not have heard this ...

Apparently, the Board will meet this week to approve the sale of *all* of 
Enron International's assets to a member of hte Saudi royal family, the same 
Prince who once invested heavily in Citicorp to bail it out.

The source of this is someone I trust.
