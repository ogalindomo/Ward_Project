Bob,

I have asked Martin, Zimin, and Paulo to prepare short presentations on the 
power, gas, and crude markets, respectively.   This will take probably 45 
minutes of class time.    In addition I will prepare some lecture 
material.    If we don't have enough class time to cover all assigned 
problems, we can just roll them to the next class.

Thanks,

Stinson
