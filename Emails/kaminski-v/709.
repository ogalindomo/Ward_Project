I will be working from my home this afternoon after 1:30 PM.  My extension 
will be forwarded to my home.  If I happen to be away from the phone taking 
care of my mother, leave a message and I will return your call immediately.  
There is a generic message on my home phone, "Please leave message after 
tone", so don't worry that you have the wrong number.  You may reach me by 
email at adupont@pdq.net.  In the next several days, I will be set up to dial 
in and you will be able to use my regualr Enron email address.  I will be at 
my desk most days, but until we have mother settled in the Rehab facility 
there may be some days or afternoons that I will be working at home.  Please 
do not hesitate to contact me if you need meetings set up or any other thing 
that you would normally request of me.  Thanks.  Anita
