Jana,

I shall be flying back from California on Friday evening, March 24.

However, Saturday or Sunday, March 25 and 26th, would work for me.

Hope to see you next week.

Vince

P.S. By the way, "American Beauty" is played at River Oaks Plaza

Vince,
I got your email, but I think we miscommunicated on the date for our movie
evening.  I was thinking of next Friday evening, March 24, because we have a
committment this evening.

I hope you are available a week from today.  Sorry about any confusion.

Look forward to getting with you next week.

Jana
