		 Subject: Network Engineering and Operations Organizational Chart

The Network Engineering and Operations organization is taking shape.  The 
attached organization chart reflects my direct reports and the major 
disciplines within the engineering organization.  Please support this 
leadership team in executing our mission to support our current network as 
well as deploy the GFN infrastructure and support systems.  

You will notice that there are many leadership openings in the organization, 
please direct any input regarding external candidates for these positions to 
Patty Pennington.

The Network Engineering Team is also attempting to recruit between 30 to 50 
people (as dictated by budget availability) across the indicated disciplines 
by mid-year.
