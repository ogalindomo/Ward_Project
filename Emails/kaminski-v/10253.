OK, will get that started.  We'll let you know when Rodney can be available 
for a trip to Houston and will follow up with you to obtain the complete 
interviewer list.

Subject: A very good candidate

Elizabeth,

We got a very good candidate we would like to bring over for an interview.
He came through an agency on London (the address is on the resumes).
The contact at the agency is Anthony Regamey.

Please, contact them to arrange an interview in Houston. Please, include
me, Stinson Gibner, Vasant Shanbhogue, Tom Gros (EBS), Jean Mrha,
Brad Blesie. We shall think about some other names later.

Vince
