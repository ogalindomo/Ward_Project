Great Job Vince.  I know people will be knocking themselves over for the 
book.  I know for a fact that the consultants can make a lot of money just 
'reselling' stuff that are in the book!  I know first hand since D&T did that 
with even the first version.

I think the FAS 133 article by some out-of-work nuclear engineer was the bomb!

Ravi.
