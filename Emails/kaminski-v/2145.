Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am sending the attached letter and a copy of my resume for my application
as a summer intern at Enron at the suggestion of my father Edward Kao. If you
need additional information, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
Candice Kao

P.S. I am sending a hardcopy of my letter and resume to you today. Thank you
once again.
