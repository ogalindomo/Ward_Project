Dear Mr. Kaminski:

How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick lunch.

You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief Minister  
(CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are from the 
same town, Latur.

I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.

I will call you tomorrow to follow up.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Maruti More
