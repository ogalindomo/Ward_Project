Vice:

I interviewed Nelson last week. Here is my feedback:

 1) Very communicative
 2) Good professional experience - works as a consultant
 3) Good quantitative background

He lacks a background in finance, which may be a minus for a position in the 
group. I beleive he may be valuable for other areas that deal with emissions 
and pollutants.
