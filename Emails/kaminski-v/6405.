Vince,

I wanted to verify if you had received the DerivaPrice.com business plan
yet.  We felt a confidentiality agreement would not be necessary but we
would appreciate it still be kept confidential.

I have also attached a Power Point that summarizes the key points of the
business plan.  Let me know what the next step will be.

Thanks!
