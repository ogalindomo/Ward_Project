Colleagues,

Professor Gabriel Bitran of MIT will be visiting Enron on Wednesday 9 August. 
He
will be here all morning. He would like to meet and discuss with us some of 
the
issues and problems that are of interest to EBS. The goal is to suggest a
research subject for one of his students that is of interest to EBS and its
business. Please let me know if you are interested in meeting him. I suggest
having one open meeting (perhaps one hour) in which all of us can sit down and
discuss the issues with him.
