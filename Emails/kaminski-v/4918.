Hello everyone:

If you were not able to access the spreadsheet we created for your time,
on the O:\Research\Common\SAP Timesheets site, please let me know.

If a box came up with "read only" on it, you may not have access to the O:\
drive.  Let me know and I will issue an SRRS request for access.

Thanks.

Shirley
