From 04/10/00 through 05/12/00, PJM will be posting sample day-ahead prices
produced using the two-settlement software and
generation bids and ties schedules as bid into the PJM real time market.
Perturbations may be applied to the demand bids in order
to illustrate the impact of total demand MWs bid on day-ahead LMPs (such
perturbations will be discussed in the day-ahead case description
file). Sample prices will be posted for weekdays only. These prices are for
illustration purposes only. They will not be used in any PJM
settlements. Sample LMPs will be posted in a csv file using the following name
convention YYYYMMDD-DA.csv. The names of files initially
posted for 4/10/00 and 4/11/00 have been changed to this name convention.

Questions may be directed to PJM Customer Service at (610) 666-8980.
