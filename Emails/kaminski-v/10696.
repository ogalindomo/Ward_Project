Dear Vince,

I apologise for sending another email.  I was wondering if you could confirm 
your talk title (plus some bullet points) for your presentation at our Annual 
US Congress.  I have attached a condensed programme for the event - you are 
speaking on stream three, part of the new research in derivatives modelling 
and analysis section.
Unfortunately we are printing the brochure at the end of the week and will 
need these details by thursday 27 January.

Best regards,
Oliver
