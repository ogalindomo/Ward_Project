Hi Mike, as per our discussion I have managed to find a place for Michael in 
EBS' D.C. office.  It is likely that he will work for me on the EBS side but 
will live in D.C.  I will finalize that later.   Vince had mentioned that it 
is okay with him as long as it is okay with you. So please double check with 
Vince on this. 

I suggest the following transition:

Start date in D.C.   May 1, 2000

From now till the start date, Michael will slowly transition into my group 
but MAKE SURE that your activities are transitioned into someone else.  But I 
would like to propose the May 1, 2000 date as hard start so that Michael will 
have to start moving few days before that, etc.


Regards,

Ravi.
