Becky,

Yes. April the  26th  will work for me. As you may know, we have another boss 
and my
uncertainty regarding where I belong continues. We used to be Enron Corp.,
but my new boss is from Enron N.A. I hope to resolve this uncertainty by 
April the 26th.

I am sorry for the delay.

Vince

Can we set up a meeting on the 26th of this month to discuss the changes?  
Please let me know.  I am open at anytime on this date.  Thanx.
