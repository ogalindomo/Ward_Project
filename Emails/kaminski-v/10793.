Kevin Kindall brought to my attention that a number of new members in the 
group may need to get access to the Research Projects Tracking database in 
lotus notes.    Access can be requested through use of the secutity resource 
request form accessed from lotus notes.    Just submit the form requesting 
that you be added as a user of the research group's Research Projects 
Tracking database.

thanks,
