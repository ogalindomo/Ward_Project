Grant & Vince,
I am sending you the results of fitting different price process models into NG
prompt month prices. The fit is quite good for some models.
We might think of using these mean-reverting jump-diffusion models in our 
Credit Model. 

I should examine other contracts behavior (beyond prompt month) as well.

Tanya.
