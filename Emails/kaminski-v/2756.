Vince and Joe,

This is just a short reminder about the four letters of recommendation. 

I have attached an envelope with each recommendation. Once you 
seal each envelope, please don't forget to sign it (over the adhesive 
seal) and to label the front, e.g. "Columbia - Joseph Hrgvocic". Also, 
I will be mailing everything in one package to each university, so 
please don't mail them out.

That is all. As always, I really do appreciate the time you're taking to 
do this.

Thank you,

Hector
