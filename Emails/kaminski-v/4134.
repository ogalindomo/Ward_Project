Hi Vince,

Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go 
to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would 
overlap with Ben's visit in November and so some alternative arrangement 
would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there 
will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until 
early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so 
then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

OUT: Sat 21st October
RETURN: Saturday 16th December

Regards,

Anjam
