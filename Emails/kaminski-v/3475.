> I attended your VAR course in Sydney in July, but when I went back to look 
at the notes recently I found that I am missing some sections (e.g. Optimal 
techniques for measuring VAR, Using Monte Carlo techniques to accurately 
calculate VAR, Evaluating the impact of volatility and extreme values on 
VAR). Would you be able to send me a copy of your notes, as I am about to 
embark on a VAR modelling exercise and I am sure they would be very useful.
