Subject: Dinner speaker - May  23


Shirley,

This is to follow up today's  conversation with Anita. As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our  dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24. On 
reflection given the strong line up for  Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on  Wednesday. This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong  incentive to be 
there for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change  should be acceptable to Vince. 

We will show Vince's name as  follows:



Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director -  Research

ENRON



Jeremy will be em ailing you the program  with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press  today. Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow. We would very much appreciate  your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes. If you would respond  to all of us it would be 
appreciated.
