Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
The program for the GARP 2001  Convention is nearly printed and I will be 
sending you a few copies of  the program in the next few days. In the 
meantime, you can find the program on  our web site at www.garp.com
?
In addition, I am writing to inquire whether your  organisation can establish 
a web link to our program through your organisations'  web site. Below is the 
information that is of most importance and that I would  like included:
?
GARP 2001 - 2nd Annual Risk?  Management Convention & Exhibition, February 
12th to 15th February,  2001,? New York.
For full program details please visit www.garp.com or contact GARP on tel. 
+44  (0)20? 7626 9300.

Of course, you could highlight your participation  at this event, which will 
include a two-day Convention with pre and post  Convention workshops and an 
Asset Management Forum that will include over 80  senior financial and risk 
management professionals. I have also attached a small  logo that could be 
used as a link to the GARP web site. Can I please have the  web address 
should you, or your colleagues manage to establish a web link to the  
Convention. If you also feel that there are any important web sites that 
this  Convention should be posted on, then I would appreciate it if you could 
pass on  this information.
?
Just to keep you informed, already, within a week  of the web site going 
'live', there have been about a dozen bookings and  numerous inquiries. This 
is a very good sign that GARP 2001 will be a great  success and will out-do 
GARP 2000.
?
Of course, if you have any questions or queries,  please do not hesitate to 
contact me. I thank you in advance for your  co-operation and I look forward 
to meeting you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
