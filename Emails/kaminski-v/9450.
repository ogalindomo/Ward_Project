Subject: Re: Telephone Interview with the Research Group


Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

Thank you for giving me a chance to talk to you.
However, I have already got an offer from another
company. I will start working as a full time after I
graduate in May.

Thank you for taking time reviewing my resume.
Have a nice day.

Sincerely,
Tammy Wang
