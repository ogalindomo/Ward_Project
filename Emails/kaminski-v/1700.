Michelle,
I've just met with Cecil and Christin. We have divided the code into 3 parts, 
and Cecil's
looking at the first part. Cecil, Helen and I will meet again tomorrow 
morning to go through
the logic of the other two parts. Since Cecil is devoted completely to this 
project, once he
starts coding, it should not take too long. 

Best,
Alex
