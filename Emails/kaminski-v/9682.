Bob Lee's official starting date is  June 5, 2000.   


Shirley,

Bob will be reporting to Zimin Lu and primarily supporting ENA.   We will 
need to find a desk for him as well as set up his phone and PC  (can we use 
Ravi's?).   Elizabeth Grant (x57583) has handled him on the HR recruiting 
side and has his contact information.

Thanks,

Stinson
