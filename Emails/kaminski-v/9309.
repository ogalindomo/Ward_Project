Michael, I think you mean Price Process Parameter Esimator. 
It is under O:\Research\Exotica\Prices\Reversion97_trend.xls

Subject: Price Process Simulator


Hi Tanya,

Hope things go well for you.  Can I get a copy of the price process simulator 
you wrote?  It would be helpful in developing a plant dispatch module for 
MONET, the power systems simulation model I co-authrored.

Thank you,
Michael
