Gentlemen, 

I have created a folder called Research Projects Folder in the Livelink test 
instance.  The URL to the test instance is 

http://nahou-kmcprm01t/livelink/livelink.exe

To log in, use your NT login id as your userid and password (all lowercase).  
You will find the folder on the Enterprise Workspace.  Please call me should 
you require further assistance.
