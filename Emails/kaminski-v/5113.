Dear all,

Please see attached spreadsheet - we will have to think of a way to automate 
the position update - right now it's a manual process to convert the text 
file that Andreas sends us to proper spreadsheet format and then pivot table 
the results - only takes about 20 minutes to do this however.  Note that the 
version 1a VaR model links via VLOOKUP to the spreadsheet attached (as you 
know, we have to use VLOOKUP because MG does not necessarily have positions 
in all forward months, whilst the pivot table only produces numbers for 
forward months with a position).

Regards,

Anjam

Our pivot table; we noticed that copper position for 19th July has option 
included but this is not reported in Mercur - I guess we should include the 
5,248 tonnes for the copper option for 2000.09, but we won't show any gamma.

Hi Tanya,

We are using the data for 19th July from Andreas - see file attached.  We are 
using this because we can reconcile to Mercur print out that we got from 
Andreas last Wednesday.  If you don't mind, perhaps Cantekin can try again 
with this new sheet attached.  We already looked at it, but would like to see 
what Cantekin can come up with independently.  I think the positions changed 
a lot from 3rd July (your data) to 19th July.

Thanks,

Anjam & Kirstee
