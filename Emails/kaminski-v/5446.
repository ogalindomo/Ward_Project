Subject: Information Technology Insurance Products- Broker Presentations


The presentations  have been scheduled for Thursday June 29, in room EB 30 
C2.  As indicated in my previous correspondence, we will hear presentations 
from Enron's two (2) primary insurance brokers.  For your convenience, we've 
scheduled these to run concurrently with a 30 minute break in between.  

8:30 - 10:00 am  John L Wortham

10:00 -10:30 break

10:30 - 12:00 noon McGriff Seibels 

The objective is:

i) An introduction of the risks associated with information technology 
activities and not adequately covered by traditional insurance products;
 
ii) The current state of the insurance marketplace and its efforts to develop 
products specifically addressing those risks;

iii) Steps required by insurers to assess and underwrite the risks.

iv) Question and Answer

The scope of these presentations is introductory in nature.  If the consensus 
opinion is to move forward with a risk assessment and cost/benefit 
evaluation, we would envisage this requiring the formation of a working 
project team, and selection of one of the presenter firms with which to 
partner.
In this context, your attendance for both presentations is requested.  If you 
are unable to attend personally, please arrange for a member of your 
management team to attend.  Please confirm your attendance to Danielle Dees 
at 713-853-3943  or via email.  For those of you at remote sites who wish 
participate via video conference, please let Danielle know so that she can 
make the necessary arrangements.
