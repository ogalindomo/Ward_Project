Dear Professor Shreve,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation at
Carnegie Mellon. I am discussing with Pierre Ste-Marie possible dates and it
seems at this point that November the 3rd would be the most convenient day.

November the 10th is an alternative date, but I need a few more days to make
a commitment.


Look forward to meeting you.
