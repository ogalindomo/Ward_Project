Hi everyone!
Hope you had a wonderful holiday. We sure did. The dogs loved playing in
snow for the first time in Colorado. Chris and I returned unscathed.

If you haven't already, please update my email address to my work email:

pam_macaul@bmc.com <mailto:pam_macaul@bmc.com>

I don't check my Hotmail account very often anymore.

Kyle, does Dana have a new email address?

Talk with you soon.
