????????Hey everyone... I have a new e-mail address! We finally broke down 
and got Road Runner High Speed Cable Internet service-- Steve has his new 
toys at the new job (laptop, fast Internet access, etc) so I got stuck with 
the slow stuff at home... Not anymore!

New e-mail:? rbsandweg@houston.rr.com

Take care! (Beijos para todos!)
