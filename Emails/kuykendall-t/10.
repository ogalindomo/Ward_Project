SuperBowl.com joins with Miller Lite to offer you an
exciting new way to enjoy fantasy football. The

for you to sign up. The Playoff Challenge, powered by
SportsLine.com, is FREE to play.

Starting the week prior to the NFL's Wild Card games
(Dec. 30-31), you will be able to assemble your own fantasy
playoff team of NFL players. Prizes will be awarded to high
scorers each week and to overall top scorers after the
Super Bowl.

Although the SuperBowl.com Playoff Challenge officially
kicks off with the start of the NFL playoffs, the site
gives you plenty of statistics and scouting reports right
now. So sign up today to get a headstart on scouting the
players you think will score the most fantasy points this
postseason.
