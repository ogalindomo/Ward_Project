Andy,

Per your request, I have outlined below the key terms of the most recent
equity transaction.

On September 8, 2000, PG&E invested $2 million in return for 7,500,000
shares ($.2667/share).
Enron's shares outstanding net of clawback equal 7,268,058 * .2667 = $1,
938,391.
Total shares outstanding as of 2/1/01 equal 31,440,896.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Todd A. Creek
