All:

For Thursday's Kiodex/Enron conference call, I would like to propose the
following agenda:

1.  Introductions (5 Minutes)
2.  Kiodex Overview and relationship history (10 minutes; Martin Chavez)
3.  Description of Kiodex co-marketing vision for the KRW on EOL (15
minutes; Mandy Medina)
4.  EOL co-marketing comments (15 minutes; Andy Zipper)
5.  Next steps (15 Minutes; All)

Possible next steps:

*EOL sends Kiodex trade data to refine KRW functional specification for the
first delivery to EOL
*Kiodex submits document outlining Kiodex co-marketing vision for the KRW on
EOL
*Schedule Kiodex business and technology team visit to Houston to meet with
the appropriate EOL team
*Kiodex submits to EOL the first round of deal documentation

If anyone has anything to add, please feel free.

Thanks,

Raj Mahajan
