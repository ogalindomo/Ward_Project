Thanks for the quick response.  I will also be traveling later this week,
however, as always, I will be available by cell.  I will send you any
additional information from our side should it become available in the
interim!

Have a safe trip!

Chris

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

Andy
