Mark,

Here is a draft for the Fee Agreement language for the margining.  this 
language should tie with the liquidated damages language that you have for 
the RTA.  I think that we will need to remove the words or settle from the 
liquidated damages paragraph.  Brokers do not have settlement risk.
