Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once "traction" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

Regards,
Todd A. Creek
