John,

I wouldn't ordinarily send these past you but are you OK with below for

David -

Chris would like to offer Sam Wehn an employment agreement.  

Can you please review the attached and let me know if you approve?  Also, 
does Lavo approve employment agreements for Chris or does Delainey?

Thanks!
Amy
