Jane,

I have printed off these forms, had John sign the employee one and have 
passed this information on to Dave Delainey.  After receiving the 
information, please let me know if you have any questions or require any 
additional information.

Thanks

As requested.   The supervisor form should be signed by Delaney and I will 
get David to sign.  Please complete to the best of your ability.  If anything 
is missing, we can follow-up with HR.
