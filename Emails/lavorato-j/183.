I am resending the Authorized Trader memo with the following changes:

 1.  I have made it clearer who the Risk Management Responsibility belongs 
to, and 
 2.  I have moved Global LNG to the Western Hemisphere - John Lavorato

Please review, make any necessary changes or suggestions, sign and fax to 
Veronica Valdez at (713) 646-2194.

Thanks,

Veronica for Ted Murphy
