Subject: Hello

John:

I am not sure whether you remember or not but I met you couple of times in 
Calgary at the trading floor and at parties (Enron's Cajun Party), while I 
was working for Enmax in 1996. I worked with Chris Calger on a number of 
trades and getting the ISDA signed. 

I started with Enron in the Commercial Structuring group earlier this month. 
I am sure the decision to purchase the entitlements (PPA) in Alberta will 
strengthen our position. I used to work in TransAlta as well, so I know the 
units pretty well. Please let me know, if I can be of any help.

I would like to stop by your office for a brief conversation or perhaps go 
for lunch, if your schedule permit.

Regards,

Sanjeev
