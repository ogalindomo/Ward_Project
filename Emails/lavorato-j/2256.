On a quarterly basis, the Executive Compensation group provides a report to 
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Executive 
Committee member stock holidings.    Such holdings include:

shares held in a family trust, 
your personal brokerage account, 
in certificate form, or 
in an IRA.  
any shares held in connection with Company plans (i.e., ESOP, savings plans, 
phantom shares, option grants, or restricted stock grants), although shares 
acquired that are held free-and-clear should be included.

Because of your inclusion in the Executive Committee, we will be requesting 
this data from you prior to each quarter's report.  Your response is greatly 
appreciated.

However, with the recent announcement and the revised Committees, I am in the 
process of updating this report in preparation for the December 11 meeting.  

I have access to shares held in the Company Plans (last bullet above).   
Please provide me with your current personal ENE stock holdings (as of 
11/30/00). 

Please contact me if you have any questions (713-345-8085).

I appreciate your response.

Mary
