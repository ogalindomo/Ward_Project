John,

Thanks for the time today.  I enjoyed talking to you about your plans for 
East Power and the 24 Hour Group.   I have been nothing but impressed with 
the caliber of people here at Enron during my short tenure, and you are no 
exception.  Leadership starts at the top, and I am encouraged that you 
represent this through your clear direction for the group and willingness to 
listen to the ideas and suggestions of your employees. 

Thanks again,

Larry
