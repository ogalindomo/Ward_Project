You know, when the accountant does the spreadsheet, it looks exactly right.  
The numbers I sent you were pulled out of context of the big picture - I need 
to re-do that (again!) for Jane's letter.  However, what you were paid is 
correct (except for the gross up on the vacation pay which we still owe 
you).  Laura says this will make complete sense when you see her spreadsheet 
and I believe her.....
