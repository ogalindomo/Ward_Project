Here is the revised draft of the document outlining the issues to be covered 
in order to provide a picture of how Ontario's market might operate from a 
pricing perspective - who can/will influence it, and how.

John, this is what I extrapolated from Jim Fallon's comments - if you think 
some of it is "irrelevent" please let Jan and I know this weekend so that we 
don't waste time.  Thanks.
