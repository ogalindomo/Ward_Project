Hi John, I hope all is going well.  I have heard lots of great things about
your on-line system.  I hope it is going well on your end.

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how you are doing with the
fundraising.  I find it a very humbling process asking people for money.
You should hit up Chris at Koch :)
