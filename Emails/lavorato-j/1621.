FYI:  The PML valuation process resulted in incremental "value" which can be 
taken into income.  I told Juanita and Andrea that it would be ridiculously 
imprudent to take any more income.  Andrea and her analytics staff tend to 
agree with me but Delainey is on to it and will likely push to take it.  I 
told Ondarza and Delainey that I will not sign off on it.  Without my 
signature, Delainey may end up calling you.  ENA has a Q4 hole that Cliff is 
trying to fill.  The income that ENA may try to squeeze from PML is 
US$2-4MM.  

On a related matter, Paul wants to take over the Board responsibilities (and 
overall management) of the deal.  Paul is comfortable with the value 
recognized to date, and agrees with us that we should not take any more.  
Given the related income form energy management (C$500M) and financial 
advisory fee (approx C$1,500M), I think it is a good thing for Enron Canada 
to manage.
