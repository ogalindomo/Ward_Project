John,

New deal was done on the gas side.  Deal was with Vinatage petroleum in 
Bolivia.  Michael Popkin can fill you in with the details.

The attached report is something that is being put together by Scott Mills 
group.  It is what I look at to get a snapshot.  Is this what you are looking 
for?  Please let me know/provide guidance as to what you want to see.  Do you 
want to be copied on this or some variant? 

Thanks,

Kish

A couple of questions.

1.  Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.

2.  How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.

Talk to you soon.
