Hi John,

I am sending out by courier today your guarantee offer.

Regarding the repairs that need to be done on your property, I will 
coordinate them with you agent and the cost of the repairs will be deducted 
from your equity.  I will send you a copy of the bills once we receive them 
to let you know how much will be deducted.

Best regards,

Patricia
