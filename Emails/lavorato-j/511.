Please note that there is a 10 day out (from the event) full refund 
cancellation policy at the Pebble Beach resort for both hotel and golf.  In 
order to save the original dates of March 8-11, 2001 for four people, I have 
sent a deposit to confirm the reservation.  If you choose not to go with 
these dates, I will have no problem receiving a full refund.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this project and if you 
would like to look at alternate dates.
THANKS!!
