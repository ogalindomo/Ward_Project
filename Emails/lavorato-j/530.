Subject: Preliminary West DPR

Chris,

We will not be able to publish a preliminary DPR or position report for 
10/31.  Port Calc has suffered a serious code crash, and the numbers 
generated are erroneous.  Our IT support will be working through the night to 
repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will 
be able to rerun an official book.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,
Monica Lande
