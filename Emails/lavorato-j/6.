Dear Deputy:

Jim Murphy has asked me to pass on some exciting news about the silent 
auction prizes:

The Medieval dinner/murder mystery prize is now complete.  As you will 
recall, this prize for twelve people is a gourmet dinner and murder mystery, 
with full medieval costumes provided.  The Palliser Hotel has now kindly 
donated 6 hotel rooms for our diners to retire to and Sunday brunch for 
twelve the next morning, to complete the prize,

Jim tells me he is inches away from clinching the NBA package.  You will 
recall that he has 10 Grizzly tickets, accomodation for 10 in Vancouver and  
he has ALMOST secured 10 tickets on WestJet.  Micheline Maes is working on 
this with Jim and they hope to get confirmation that the airline tickets will 
be donated soon.  I will keep you posted.  If you can help us to get these 
tickets, please call Jim.









Also, the Sunshine Village prize (4 people get a limo ride to Sunshine, lift 
tickets, ski rentals and 3 days/3 nights at the Sunshine Village Inn, 
including food -- must be taken in February or April, 2000) is complete.

And, the Moondance Guest Ranch prize (4 people get a limo ride to the Guest 
Ranch, 5 nights, 5 days at the Ranch, food, horses, and other amenities and 
lodgin) is complete.

Tell your friends who will be attending the party, so they will be ready to 
bid BIG $$$ on these prizes!!

Good work Jim!

Liz
