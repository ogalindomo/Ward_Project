Happy New Year!!

1.    A couple of things on fundraising:

PPPPLLLEASE send your cheques to Michael Leahy with the attached form 
correctly filled out.  DO NOT send to Enviros.  The reason for this is that 
we need to keep records so that we can prepare the list of donors for the 
Brochure, the newspaper ad and the thank-you letters.

Keep up the hard work on getting donations.  Let me know if you need other 
information, such as Michael's address (see attachment), tax info, more 
brochures, flow through share donation infor, etc. etc.
