John  Thanks for the update.  I found out after we talked that there were 
also several expense account related problems, which will not happen under 
our responsabilty.

On Ed Graham.

I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.

Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the 
issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to 
perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0. 

I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

John
