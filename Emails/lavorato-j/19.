Hi John,

I am attaching a spreadsheet that details all of the donations you have
reported for the Order of Good Cheer to date.

Please review the information I have recorded for accuracy, as this is
how the names will appear in the brochure, website, and thank-you
letters.  If I have entered anything incorrectly please let me know by
Tuesday afternoon.

Thank you John, and I look forward to seeing you at the party!
