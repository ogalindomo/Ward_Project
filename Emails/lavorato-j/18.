Well, to date it looks like we're just over $176,000.  Way to go!

Thank you to everybody that has contacted Michael and I regarding
donations.  I'm attaching the main spreadsheet that details all of the
donations that have been reported to date.  This should give you a good
idea of where we're at.  Please take a look at it - if you have any
comments please let me know.

We have not heard from a few of you yet, and rumor has it that there are
still a few donations that haven't been reported to us.  Please e-mail
me or phone us by Tuesday with the name and $$ amount of the expected
donation and we will ensure they get proper credit in the brochure etc.

Regards,

Kelly Trout and Michael Leahy
