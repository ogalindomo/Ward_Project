By now everyone should have received Kelly's email -- reporting our current 
fundraising tally to be over $176,000.00!!  Well done everybody.  I couldn't 
believe my eyes this morning when I saw Kelly's email.

This is a great day to be a member of the Order of Good Cheer!!!!

But, don't stop there.  Keep up the hard work, because there is no reason why 
we shouldn't be striving for $200,000.00 now.  Afterall, the last 3 years we 
have blown our targets out of the water.  It would be great to report that we 
have doubled our official target of $100,000.00!!!!!

Kelly tells me that even more cheques have arrived today and that she has 
been hearing from lots of you with corrections.  Brian Boulanger and Kelly 
will be finalizing the list soon, so please scrutinize the spelling of your 
donors and contact Kelly with any amendments!

Thank you everyone for all your hardwork so far.  I can't wait to celebrate 
this tremendous success with each of you on Friday!!

Liz
