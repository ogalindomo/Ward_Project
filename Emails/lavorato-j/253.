John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.
