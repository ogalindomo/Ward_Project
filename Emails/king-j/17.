Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.
