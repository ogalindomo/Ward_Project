I would like to take out Tina Harmon at Cng Producing to the spa one 
afternoon this month.   Cng always gives me the majority of her Destin gas 
both term and spot and they have been very flexible with us moving the nomin 
around both intraday and next day.     I wanted to show my appreciatiion, not 
that I wouldn't love a a tript o the spa!

Is that okay with you?   thanks.
