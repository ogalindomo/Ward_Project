I don't have any plans to travel down there at this point.  But if this 
changes I will let you know and would love to play some golf.

Scott, 

I understand that John Lavorato and others are going to Sao Paulo next week 
to review the Trading business. Are you planing to join them in that trip? If 
you do, come to BA and we play some golf at Pilar.

Did someone from Europe contact you to ask about me?
