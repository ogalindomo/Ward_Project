Attached is an updated Timetable detailing the critical path issues of the 
Fort Pierce Repowering Project.
Specifically, note items scheduled for completion during the next two weeks, 
such as:

Internal/External review and execution of the Land Lease Option, Ground Lease 
and Project Development Agreement
Preparation of an EPC contract
Site visit to an existing, enclosed 7FA and HRSG (Coyote Springs appears to 
be the best option)
Review and prepare applications for an air permit, an ERP (if necessary), 
special use permit, waste water permit and interconnect request

Let me know of ANY conflicts, concerns or adjustments associated with the 
attached.

Thanks again for your help,
Mathew
