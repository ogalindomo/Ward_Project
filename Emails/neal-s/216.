Scott:

Origination was granted to Robin last night for $468.  However, I wanted to 
bring it to your attention that sitara  #618541 and 618626 are two day deals 
and my calculations show that $708 may instead be the correct amount of 
origination.  Please correct me if I'm wrong or let me know if I should grant 
to Robin an extra $240 tonight.    

Thanks,
Alejandra
