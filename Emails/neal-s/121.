Don't comfort yourself by saying things are better  for the Dow. Right now, 
half the earnings of the Dow comes from just six stocks  -- Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing, IBM, Johnson &  Johnson, ExxonMobil, Merck and United 
Technologies --  and most of those are defensive. So the Dow is functioning 
as a lagging  indicator of the failing economy. The Nasdaq is a far more 
sensitive barometer.  Don't ignore it just because it's giving you a weather 
forecast you don't like.
