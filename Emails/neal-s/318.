Jennifer Milligan will be contacting regarding the intern program.  She will 
probably want a resume from you.
Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing, 
research, etc.)  you have interest in working. 

Please keep me up to date once she contacts you.

Sincerely,

Scott

Scott-
 Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who
would be contacting me had my email address.  It is cgraeter@tamu.edu.  I
know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.

Sincerely,
Chris Graeter
