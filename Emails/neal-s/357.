Hola amigo !!!  I am already missing the Houston beers che.
Hey, we are going live on EOL here in south america.... incredible but real !
Rolo launched gas on monday and I will be coming on probably the following 
week.

In order to show potential customers how a liquid product works, could you 
tell me what product I can show them to actually reflect a moving bid/offer.

Thanks, Julian
