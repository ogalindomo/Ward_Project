Subject: Make Up Game Schedule Change


Wildcats:

The Lions could only field a team of 9 players for the game Saturday and
we
have been asked to change the game time to:

Sunday, October 22 at  4:30pm

Unless there is an overwhelming negative response to the change, I will
advise
the league in the Friday morning that we will agree to the schedule
change.

So, if you are opposed to the time change please call me before 8am
Friday, at:
281.541.1878.

Thank you.
