Thank you for agreeing to speak at the All Accounting Offsite on May 23 at 
the Adams Mark Hotel.  We expect to have approximately 500 participants in 
the large ballroom.  We will provide a laptop and projector, so you can 
either send your presentation to Sharron Westbrook in advance or you can 
bring the file with you to load.  We plan to post the presentations on the 
Enron intranet after the offsite so we won't need to make hard copies 
available.

The proposed agenda follows:

8:30 Opening Remarks    Rick Causey
9:15 Panel:  Cash Reporting and Forecasting  Bob Butts, Wes Colwell, Tim 
Despain, Mary Perkins
10:15 Break
10:30 Panel:  New Enron Businesses   Mike McConnell and Ray Bowen
11:30 I Buy it and GSS Update   George Wasaff
12:00 Lunch
1:00 Project Sunrise Update    Jan Johnson and Mark Frank
1:30 Interaction between Tax and Accounting Greek Rice and Jim Ginty
2:00 Enron Center South Update   Bill Donovan
2:30 Investor Relations Update   Paula Rieker
3:15 Break
3:30 Trading Simulation    Scott Neal

If this time will not work for you or if you have questions, please let 
Sharron know.  

Thanks Again, Rick
