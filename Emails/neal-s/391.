Based on our conversation earlier tonight, attached please find the 
comparison of load and value before and after due diligence, adjusted also 
for market movement in the intervening time.

Jim, I have also attached the most recent Propane and Storage inserts for the 
Asset Agreement, since you may not have them at your home.  I hope you have a 
safe and fun travel day tomorrow and I look forward to speaking again Friday 
afternoon (or morning,  palm tree time).

Jeff/Bob, please call tomorrow after you have had a chance to review the 
inserts internally.  In addition, I would be happy to address any thoughts or 
questions you have about the load and value comparison.

Regards,
Ed
