Would either of you be responsible on the ENA side for signing an "Assignment 
of Gas Contract?"  Thank you.

I believe that it would either be Scott Neal or Hunter Shively.  

Did you find an unexecuted copy of the assignment?

Linda

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible 
for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense 
contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of 
me.  Thanks.
