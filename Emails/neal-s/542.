We have become aware that brokers are currently obtaining guest ID's from our 
customers and are using EnronOnline as a price discovery mechanism. This 
obviously does not benefit Enron as no transactions are generated  and 
consumes considerable systems resources. In order to curb this practice and 
to generate revenue we  are currently exploring the possibility of offering 
Brokers and the Press non- transactable guest ID access to EnronOnline for a 
fee. Please let us know if you have any concerns , comments or feedback 
regarding this issue. Thank You.
