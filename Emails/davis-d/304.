>>Thought for Today:
>>
>>WHISPER JESUS
>>
>>
>>Today, I got a burden,
>>And I felt that I should pray,
>>For God's spirit seemed to tell me,
>>That you were having a bad day.
>>I don't know just what that problem is,
>>But I sure do know the cure;
>>And if you'll only let Him,
>>God will keep you safe and secure.
>>In life there are always problems;
>>Cropping up to spoil our day;
>>But my FRIEND you know the answer,
>>"".
>>
>>If you still feel you're defeated,
>>And you want to run and hide;
>>Just reach out, and I'll be there,
>>Standing right there by your side.
>>So remember-WHISPER JESUS
>>For He's just a prayer away.
>>He's so close that you can touch Him,
>>"".
