dana,

i had the e-sched. and marnie now has them.  When we take files out of the 
cabinet, do we need to sign a in/out form?

Subject: E-Schedules

Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.

Thanks.

Dana
