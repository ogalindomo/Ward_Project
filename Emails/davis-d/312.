Please join us on Thursday, August 10 in the Enron Suite at Enron Field for 
some baseball fun.  The game starts at 3:05 p.m., so plan to leave the office 
around 2:00 p.m.

Appetizers will be served.

Cindy will be handing out tickets sometime that morning.

Please let her know if you will be unable to attend the game.

Thanks
