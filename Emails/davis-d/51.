RE: WALMART - CORPORATE MORAL STANCE


Okay, folks, let's put our mouth where our money is . . .  I am not sure
about the rest of you, but I feel like my family single-handedly keeps
Wal-Mart in business!   This is truly a courageous company and they
deserve our very vocal support at this time.  - Sandy Zeek
