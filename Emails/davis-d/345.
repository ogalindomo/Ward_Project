In case there is any confusion all training classes that are scheduled to 
start at 8am will be starting at 8AM.

If you are not in class by 8:10am your RC will be charged as if you are a no 
show.  Business Units will be charged $150 per 8 hour class for a user that 
is enrolled in a class but does not show-up.  If a user misses 1 day of a 
multiple day course, the business unit will be charged for everyday of that 
class (ex. 4 day class => 4 days *  $150 = $600).

By 8:20 am :  The door to all classrooms will be closed 20 minutes after the 
start of the scheduled training class.  At this point, stand-by users will be 
able to take a seat.  If a seat is still available, late arrivals will be 
allowed to attend but will not receive CPE credits.  This rule applies to 
participants that miss more than 20  minutes of class.

There are a considerable number of users throughout both ENA and Enron that 
are being trained over the next two months.  Please try and be respectful of 
others that are attending your class and be on time.

From the SAP Training Team (Please read the information I have highlighted in 
RED as this is new information):

Answers to Commonly Asked Questions:
How will CPE credits be determined?  
 CPE credits will be granted according to established CPE Accreditation 
Procedures governed by our sponsor ID.  In order to receive CPE credits,   
participants must:
Sign the attendance sheet for everyday of a given class
Attend the entire class
Complete an evaluation for the class prior to leaving the classroom
 All CPE credits will be  granted at the conclusion of all SAP classes 
(approximately August 30th).

What is the attendance policy for training?
 In an effort to be supportive, we are trying to be accommodating this week 
in regards to attendance.  We do recognize that people's schedules change  
and emergencies happen.  However, it is our responsibility to make sure that 
all participants who are attending class receive the best possible 
training.   Therefore, the following guidelines will be followed: 
Business Units will be charged $150 per 8 hour class for a user that is 
enrolled in a class but does not show-up.  If a user misses 1 day of a 
multiple day course, the business unit will be charged for everyday of that 
class (ex. 4 day class => 4 days *  $150 = $600).  In order to avoid these 
charges, users must send an email to 'Apollo and Beyond Registrar'  stating 
their need to cancel before  the beginning of the training class.  Emails 
received after the beginning of the class will be considered no-shows.
Users that are not enrolled in classes but choose to show-up may attend on a 
stand-by basis.  This means that if there are open seats available then 
stand-by users may attend.  However, if no seat is available or a registered 
user shows-up within the allotted 20 minute window, the stand-by user will 
not be allowed to participate in the class.
The door to all classrooms will be closed 20 minutes after the start of the 
scheduled training class.  At this point, stand-by users will be able to take 
a seat.  If a seat is still available, late arrivals will be allowed to 
attend but will not receive CPE credits.  This rule applies to participants 
that miss more than 20  minutes of class.
