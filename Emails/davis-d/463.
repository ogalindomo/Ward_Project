I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and 
submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on 
them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules.

Dana,
4th Qtr 2000?  I don't have them but I'm curious.  Were copies ever turned in 
to Keith Simper? 

Thanks,
Tammy

Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.

Thanks.

Dana
