E-Schedules are due to Corporate by Monday, October 23.  Could each of you 
please make sure you have your schedules to me by Friday morning for review?  
Also, could you please respond to this e-mail with which E-Schedules you are 
responsible for (if any) so that I can ensure that all have been assigned?

Thanks,
Marnie
