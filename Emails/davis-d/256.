Dear Dana,
?
Thank you so much for your prayers and your  thoughtfulness.? I was so 
blessed by "Thus Far".? Falling short is  something we all do daily, but it's 
good to know that God knows exactly who we  are and loves us anyway.? Ain't 
That Good News!!!!!!
?
?
May God continue to Bless and Keep you.? God  Loves you and so do I.
