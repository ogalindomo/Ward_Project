Subject: Support Tips Emails

And you thought that it couldn't get any better.....but it does!!  Keep 
looking for the Support Tipemails coming soon to LotusNotes everywhere.

So I got my eHROnline ID.....but what's my SAP GUI id???
The SAP ID that should have been received by users this week was for BOTH eHR
Online AND the SAP GUI. 
Also remember that although several people may have been working with alpha 
IDs (rsmith) for the past several months, these IDs WILL BE TURNED OFF by 
JULY 15, 2000.  Users are STRONGLY encouraged to begin using their Pid for 
their GUI transactions, and MUST use their Pid for any time entry on eHR
Online.
  
What about the passwords?
The passwords are synchronized, so this means that when a user logs on online 
and changes their initial password from their birthday to one of their 
choosing it is changed in ALL INSTANCES OF SAP; PR1, PR2 and all online 
sessions (the online sessions are just an extension of PR1 and PR2).  This 
new password is now good IN ALL PRODUCTION BOXES, ie. PR1 and PR2.  The users 
should NOT try and log on to the GUI with their birthday if they have already 
changed their password online or viceversa.
