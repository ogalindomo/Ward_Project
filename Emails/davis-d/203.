CCLC Parents

I am asking that your children wear their CCLC shirts every fourth sunday
so that we may be uniform during children's moment.  Only on the fourth
sunday, not the second.  Thanks for your cooperation.

If you know of any other CCLC parents with emails please let me know or
forward this message to them.

Cheryl Sumbler
Joe Stewart
Elna Armstrong
Claudette Montgomery
