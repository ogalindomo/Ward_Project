Hi Dana ,
?
I was so blessed to receive your prayer this  morning, thank you.? I'm 
forwarding the prayer back to you, knowing that  God is already blessing you 
today as he does every day.? Just the mere fact  that we were chosen to be 
prayer partners is evidence that God is at work in  ways that we don't always 
readlily see.
?
Look forward to seeing you tonight at Power Time.  May God continue to bless 
and keep you. 
?
Your sister in Christ, 
?
Love,
?
Betty
