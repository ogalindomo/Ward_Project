Dana & Claudette,

     Would you two be willing to co-host the November women's meeting?
Check your calendars to see if 11/18/00 is available about 5:00 pm.  Please
let me know.  We are trying to finish out our calendar year.  Prayer on it
and over it.

     Don't forget the meeting tonight at 6:00 pm at the church, prior to the
MOP meeting.

Denise
