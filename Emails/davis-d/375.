Great news everyone.......

Dorothy and Tim are the proud parents of a 9 lb 9 1/2 oz and 21 1/2 inches 
long baby boy born @ 3:15 pm today.  Mother and baby are both doing fine.  He 
has lots of brown hair with red tints.  They have not named him yet, but I 
will forward that information as soon as I get it.
