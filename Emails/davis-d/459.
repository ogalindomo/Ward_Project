Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them.  
FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check 
out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  
Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional 
hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone 
will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for 
your cooperation.

Dana

Subject: E-Schedules

Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.

Thanks.

Dana
