Brad,
Would you please coordinate the AA request below with our accountants?  We're 
only needing new 2000 deals.  Let's provide to AA by the end of the day, this 
Friday.
Thanks,
Mike

Mike-

We would greatly appreciate it if you could please see to it that we obtain 
the wire transfer and requests for all investments entered into during FY00.  
Please note that on a go-forward basis we would like to obtain this 
information when we receive an investment's DASH.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.


Thanks,

Kristi
