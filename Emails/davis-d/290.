Ben,

As per a voicemail I left you today, one of the Enron Global Markets Teams 
(Global Risk Markets) is awaiting the reversal of a check (to Goldman Sachs) 
that was wired out instead.  Kortney Brown and Dana Davis had worked with you 
and Lupy Spencer on this before.  Last anyone heard, it had made it to your 
desk.

I was checking to see if that was the case and if there would be any 
difficulty in voiding a legacy MSA check on the new SAP system.  Please let 
me know what you find or if you need any further information.
