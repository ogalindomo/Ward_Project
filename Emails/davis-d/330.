Unless you have exception time (vacation/sick/Fwp) you will not have to fill 
out a timesheet - this is for exempt personnel only.  For those of you who 
do, I will be coming by to assist you.

So far I have the following people with exception time:

Lisa King
Lisa Best
Angeles Beltri
Amy Weaver
Tammy Barta
Krysti Knight
Kevin Jolly
Mike Galvan
Adarsh Vakharia
Hope Vargas

If I have left anyone off, please let me know.

Remember, timesheets need to be completed by 12:00 p.m. on Friday, June 30.

Thanks for your cooperation
