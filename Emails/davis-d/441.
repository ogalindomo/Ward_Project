Yes, close will take priority.  That is a free time job.  Thanks for the 
update.

Subject: Question

Is it OK that I let entries take priority over those documents that you 
wanted me to hole punch and place in binders for you?  I thought I could do 
it for sure today and I still might be able too but I want to make sure that 
I don't fall behind on the entries.  Is that OK?  Oh yeah, Brad and Lisa Kang 
had me working on projects for them Friday and Monday.
