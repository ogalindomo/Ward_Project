The baby shower for Pam will be held Friday, November 03 in EB3270 from 2:00 
to 3:00.  We will be serving cake and punch.  If you will be attending please 
R.S.V.P. to me by Tuesday, October 31, so that we can order an accurate 
amount of chairs for this event.

For those of you wanting to donate, see me at least a day before the shower, 
or sooner.    If you would like to buy your own gift she is registered at 
Babies R Us and Target.

If you have any questions, please call me at 57816.
