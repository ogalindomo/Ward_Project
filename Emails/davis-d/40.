Subject: Holiday Goodies!!!


 The holidays are fast approaching and rather than the customary floor pot 
luck, someone came up with the idea of consecutive days of baked goods  (i.e. 
cookies, cakes, candy, etc.) strategically placed all over the floor.  

 The goodie days will be December 12, 13 and 14th!

 If you would like to participate, please send your admin an e-mail that 
includes what you would like to bring!!!   We can go back to our diets in 
January!!!
