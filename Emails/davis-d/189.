Hello all,

I just wanted to let all of you know that my last day at Enron is October 31, 
2000.  I have decided to take a position with Deloitte and Touche.  It's an 
excellent opportunity and I'm looking forward to getting started.  I hope all 
of you will keep in touch.  My home number is 713-799-2774 and my home e-mail 
address is ashaunte@aol.com.  Feel free to call any time.

I'll be in touch once I get settled in at Deloitte and Touche.  

Have a great weekend!

Alysia
