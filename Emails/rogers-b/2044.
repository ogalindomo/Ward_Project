After an incredible holiday of travelling and partying, I needed some time
to rest and dry out.  I looked into those fancy resort spas and they were
way to expensive.  And then I thought, what better way to do it then be
stranded on a ship for six months.  I will lose some weight, get in shape,
grow my liver back, and come out a lean, mean fighting machine.  It is day 3
of the six month "cruise" and I don't seem to feel much different?  I hope
they didn't lie to me...

This is my new address as my old PwC address will only be read when I am in
a port.  I hope everyone had blast over the holidays and here is a picture
on New Years of me before I got really out of control.
