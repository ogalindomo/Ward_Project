Attached please find the weekly cost report.  The only material change is a 
reduction in Gleason Start-up Fuel/Power.  A credit for the sale of power was 
not booked against the project until after closing.  I am working with Ben 
Jacoby, Fred Mitro, and Chris Booth to review Estimate to Complete and Total 
Projects.   We are focusing in on a couple of areas, one being the 
Westinghouse Turbines.  We have withheld money for Liquidated Damage claims 
for both Wheatland and Gleason.

Additionally, we have scheduled the final Nepco audit for August 28th - 
30th.  We will be reviewing actuals, estimate to complete and ultimately the 
final forecast.  


Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks Amy 3-7805
