Gents,

I made the following changes to this model:
I adjusted all the NPV functions to be as of 12/31/2000.
I incorporated the seasonal availabilities and capacities into revenue 
calculations.  Previous to this revision, all monthly merchant revenue was 
calculated using the Winter availability and Summer capacity.  All monthly 
PPA revenues were calculated using annual average availability and Summer 
capacity.
I cleaned up the update macro and added a nifty status bar progress indicator 
while the thing's running.

Let me know if you have any other revisions or corrections.

Jon
