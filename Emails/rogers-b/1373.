At Don Millers request, attached is the PPA Term sheet, the associated  Memo 
and PDA Term sheet for your review and consideration.  Thank you in advance 
for your time and effort.  Also, please be advised that notwithstanding the 
language contained in the PPA Term sheet we plan upon seeking cost of cover 
damages and therefore no damage multipliers will be necessary.
