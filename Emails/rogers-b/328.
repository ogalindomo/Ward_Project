Here's our local counsel's response on the Duke question relating any 
contractual obligations (in Indiana) to retain a certain minimum number of 
employees.  His answer relates specifically to the tax abatement that we 
received.  In his memo, he suggests that we speak with John Gregg (which as 
you both know I have already done).  He mentioned that going below nine 
employees would likely ruffle some political feathers.  If I am not mistaken, 
however, I believe that we have more than nine people and therefore there 
might be some economies that are achievable by a potential buyer.
