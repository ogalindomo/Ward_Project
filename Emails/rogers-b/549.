Don, to be more specific....
1) Are the units started in parallel or sequence? (Could you please provide
a diagram of the ramp-up sequence to include timing)
2) How much start up power is required?
3) Is start up power purchased from Cinergy &/or IPL?  At what tariff rate?
4) How many Mwh are produced during start up? (May include as part of #1)
5) How much fuel is burned (MMBTU's) during start up?(May include as part of
#1)

Thanks for your help Don.
John

Can all four units at Wheatland be started simultaneously?
