Dear Ben:

I enjoyed meeting with you.  I sent a letter recommending you to our Dean
in charge of the MBA program.  Let me know if you hear anything from the
people in the admissions office.

I hope things work out and I have the opportunity to have you participate
in our energy finance program.

By the way, I like the idea of bringing in various industry leaders.  I
currently do this in my class, but it might make sense to consider ways to
get first year students involved in this activity.

regards,

Sheridan
