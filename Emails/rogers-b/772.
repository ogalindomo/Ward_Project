Team,

As everyone knows, we will use DealBench (a secure on-line platform) as a 
virtual due diligence room and for more. We are in the process of uploading 
electronic copy of due diligence documents, plant pictures, due diligence 
list, management presentation with voices of developers and more on 
DealBench. 

Attached is the first draft of DealBench instruction I prepared. You will 
receive invitation email(s) to DealBench. Please read attached instruction 
and  log onto DealBench. Please give us any comments on using DealBench based 
on your experience. We will improve this instruction and send out to Phase II 
bidders next week. 

Regards,

Jinsung Myung
