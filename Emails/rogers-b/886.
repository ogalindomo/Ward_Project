Dave Delainey has requested feedback on all the interested parties by this 
Friday.  If you have recently made contact with your respective company(s), 
please drop me a line and let me know the latest.  If no contact has been 
made recently, please call and see how things are going.  All of these 
companies should have had books for a week plus.  As you all are aware, bids 
are due a week from Friday.  I am unsure who ultimately made the contact with 
some of these companies, so I have bunched them together.  If there are some 
companies that I haven't included, but that you have feedback on, please let 
me know what it is.  Thanks for all your help, and it looks like the real fun 
is just around the corner.
