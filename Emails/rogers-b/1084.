Elizabeth and I would like to thank everyone who came to our wedding and
shower.  It wouldn't have been the same without all of your participation.
We have returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii and are now moved into our new
apartment here in NYC.  We are now trying to move all of our wedding and
shower gifts into our little one bedroom apartment.  It's a good problem to
have, though.  If you are ever in town, please give us a call.  Thanks again
and we look forward to seeing you in the near future.

New Address:
1315 3rd Ave., #2FS
New York, NY  10021
