I changed Heat rates for Caledonia and Gleason, and Start Charge for Gleason. 
Heat rates has no impact on numbers. Only increased start charge reduced IRR 
from 13.966% to 13.947% with same debt and equity scenario. I think we can 
stay with previous numbers (debt and equity) with new heat rates and start 
charge. Jin
