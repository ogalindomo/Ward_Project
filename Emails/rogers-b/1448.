This sure sounds like a deal Len Gunderson was looking at early this year and 
a large chemical facility. The capacity for the project did not match what 
equipment it was based on - any more details so I can see if we have any data 
from that earlier look?

We are still looking for capital costs for a 730 MW plant in Texas, which 
comprises of 4 FA's and 2 STG's.  We are currently using $450 MM for a total 
project cost number, which comes out to be $616/Kw.
Thanks
