Subject: Making a List & Checking it Twice!

Hey Team!  Here we are, 6 weeks away from the MS150, at 139 and growing.  
Please check the list and if your name is not here and you think it should 
be, please let me know ASAP.  

We have a VERY IMPORTANT DEADLINE on MARCH 15.  That's the day the MS Society 
determines team size, and that's when we qualify for our SUPER START.  The 
largest team, as of March 15, starts first.  If you rode with us last year, 
you'll recall going out the gate first, which is the only way to travel!  I 
can't count you as registered unless you let me know you've registered with 
the MS Society, or we have registered you through Enron.  If you have any 
friends thinking about joining the team, it's really important to get that 
done by March 15.

Of course, you can still register after that date, but the fee raises to $35, 
and we ask your support in getting all our riders listed as soon as possible.

THANK YOU FOR RIDING WITH ENRON!
