I would like to schedule a conf. call on Tuesday morning the 16th, at 11:00 
am (Houston time) to update everyone on GENCO and answer any questions that 
you all may have and also to see where we stand on PPAs, models, PDAs, 
curves, etc.  I am sitting down with Delainey and Donahue on Wednesday to 
talk about all the above and I need to be in a position to send out 
preliminary info late Wednesday or early Thursday to interested parties.  

I will schedule a call-in number.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,

Don
