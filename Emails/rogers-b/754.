Ben,

I hope I passed the test........The retreat went very well.  I've been
thinking about your role at Cinergy and have concluded that involvement in
the DG area is the best place for you to grow and develop as an executive.
The assignment will be tough because you will be front running the market.
But, the opportunity to develop an expertise in marketing in this area will
be invaluable if the industry develops as I believe it will.  Let's talk.

Dad

This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a
call sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite
busy.  Give me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!
Ben
