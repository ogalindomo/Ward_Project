TOTALLY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT WE WILL HAVE THE OFFICIAL UNVEILING OF OUR 
2000 ENRON JERSEY AT THE BIKE CLUB MEETING ON TUESDAY, MARCH 14 - 11:30, 
EB49C1.  GOOD TIME TO PICK YOURS UP.  YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST IN THE 
CITY TO SEE IT, AND IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THIS YEAR!

THANKS TO JOHN NORDEN FOR PAINSTAKINGLY WORKING THROUGH THE DESIGN AND ORDER 
PROCESS FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS.  HE DID A GREAT JOB, AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN IT 
IS UNVEILED.  

BECKY PHAM, UNIFORM OFFICER FOR THE BIKE CLUB, WILL BE ON HAND TO DISTRIBUTE 
THEM, AND STEPHANIE STRONG, OUR TREASURER, IS LENDING A HAND ON THIS 
PROJECT.  THE TWO OF THEM HAVE OFFERED TO HANDLE ALL THE DETAILS OF 
DISTRIBUTION, AND IT IS A HUGE JOB, SO THANKS IN ADVANCE TO THEM, AND THEY 
KNOW YOU APPRECIATE IT, BUT TELL THEM ANYWAY !!!!!

SEE YOU TUESDAY !
