John,

I have scheduled a meeting with you Monday at 1:00pm to discuss our TECO 
deal.  It seems as if we're getting traction around a structure and the 
efforts are focusing on how to maximize our leverage during distress 
periods...your expertise.  The attached materials will help frame the 
discussion.  Meeting attendees will be you, me, Lou Stoler (legal) and Billy 
Lemmons (CTG).

The rest of you are getting the same materials for your reference.

regards,

Don Black
