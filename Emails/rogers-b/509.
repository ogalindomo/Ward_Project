Subject: Plant Load Questions


Based on the plant design (not measured values), the Full Load Parasitic
would be about 4,600 kW, the "Stand-By" Parasitic load would be about 385 kW
(power backfed through GSU Transformers). If the plant is held in "Stand-By"
without the GSU's energized, then the parasitic drops to about 85 kW.

Mike Connelly is expected back in Bothell tomorrow. He should be checking
his e-mail so you might want to sent him a message (if you haven't done so
already).
