Folks,

Attached is a listing of retail shorts accrued to date.  The idea is to use 
our LM6000's, 6B's or Italian turbines to cover these positions.  Maybe we 
could sell the combination of shorts and machines to an IPP such as Calpine 
or AES who should be looking for earnings.  I would like to meet Friday at 
10:30 to plot out strategy and discuss the required analysis.  In the 
interim, please familiarise yourself with the data.

regards,

Don Black
