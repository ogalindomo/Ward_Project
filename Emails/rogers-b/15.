I used the following login information we set up during our presentation, 
however, I got the following error message:

user name:  cwatts
password:  cwatts

Unknown user name or password.  ORA 01017 invalid username/password; logon 
denied Alias Power.

Thanks immensely for the EnPower presentation and all the helpful 
information.  We will be in touch.
