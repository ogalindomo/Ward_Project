This is the finalized DRAFT agreement with Cinergy for the maintenance of the 
Wheatland switchyard.  I recommend including it and the e-mail below in the 
due diligence.  I'll hold off on signing until we know something more on the 
sale.

Subject: Revised Wheatland Proposal


Larry, Attached is the revised proposal that you and I spoke about. We have
incorporated the adjustments for meter testing and have slightly adjusted
the proposal price. Please review the modifications and if acceptable I will
mail out the signed hard copies upon receipt of your approval. Thanks for
your patience and cooperation during this development period. Hopefully in
the future if the occasion arises for us to pursue these same services, we
will have the foundation for a quick agreement,
Thanks again,
Dale
