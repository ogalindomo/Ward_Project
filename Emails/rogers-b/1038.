Attached is a redlined draft of the IM.  If we're not done, we're very 
close.  

If you want to do away with the redlines, while in Word, go to Tools/Track 
Changes.  You can either accept all changes or, if you simply want to print, 
go Highlight Changes and uncheck the third box - Highlight Changes in Printed 
Document.
