Hey Ben,

How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC?
He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring
out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off.
This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of
the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the
envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every
school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would
probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my
achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this
ship.

I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long.
There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a
goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The
summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit
people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?

I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since
the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get
killed.  See you in the summer.

CHOB
