Dear Ben:

I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to meet you during 
the Super Saturday.

I am waiting with anxiety for the final results and I am very confident that 
the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing 
with the demands of the firm in the present.

Thank you once again for your time and your contribution to the Event.

Sincerely,

Teseo Bergoglio
