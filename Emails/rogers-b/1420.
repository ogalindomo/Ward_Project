Subject: Texas Tolling Exploratory Pricing: Corrected

The intrinsic valuation in the Corpus quote was incorrect, it is corrected in 
this file!

Berney asked me to run these scenarios for you: Wolf Hollow, Corpus Christi.
  Please see attached file.  Pricing is not for transaction purposes.



Thank you, (call with any questions)
