Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a
weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming
weekend.  I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out
with, but will take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to
everyone informing them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to
rent out for Saturday night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a
bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a
list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks
for the help and lets talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
