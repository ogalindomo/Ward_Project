Margaret,

My name David Martin.  I graduated from the MBA/MPA program at UT in May 1998 
and I am currently a Manager at Enron North America in the Restructuring 
Group.  I am writing to you in reference to a Fall 2000 MBA candidate named 
Benjamin Rogers.  He is an Associate here at Enron and in my opinion an 
excellent candidate for the UT MBA program.  He has already submitted his 
application and is anxiously awaiting a response.  Ben came to Enron as an 
Analyst and was recently promoted to an Associate, something not many 
Analysts are able to do.  He has worked in several groups throughout Enron 
and is very serious about the possibility of attending UT.  Please take my 
highest of recommendations into consideration when you assess his entrance 
into the program.  Thank you.

Regards,
David Martin
