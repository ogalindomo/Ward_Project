Linda, Tom,

Today's call at 3:00 CDT should be brief.  I'll try to originate by calling 
both your numbers.  I propose the agenda include the following:

Review of rating agency meetings
Response from Moodys and Enron's response back
Insurance issues ref. Enron's product
Update on development status of project
Deliverables and timing

regards,

Don Black
