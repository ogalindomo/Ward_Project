Ben,

I think we need to clean the Calpine model. We will get the firmer pricing 
from Structuring tomorrow. As soon as we have that, we need to come back to 
Scott with the pricing and the model. Here is some comments.

- Install switch to see unlevered IRR
- Clean up IDC

Scott wants to see what would be the capacity pricing to get unlevered IRR of 
9%. Let's talk in the morning.
