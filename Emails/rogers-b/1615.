Subject: Re: LM6000 Proforma O&M Questionaire  

Bob, here's the blank forms for info. Also, there is a questionnaire written 
for SC LM6000 plants. Answer what you can and ignore if n/a or redundant. 


The DePere info sheet is in hardcopy since we did it over in your 
workstation. I'll have a copy faxed. Please provide you fax #.

thanks
