Ben,
There are two different classes starting Nov. 18...
Please give me a call at 713/688-5500... Or really anyone in
the office can help you if I am on the phone, to sign up.
But do call as soon as possible as seating is limited.
Thanks!
Amy

Amy:
If I could take the class beginning on November 18th, that would be great.
I think it would really help me get some problems I've been having worked
out.  Thanks again for taking the time to get back with me, I greatly
appreciate it.
Regards,
Ben
