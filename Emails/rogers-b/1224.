Today is my last day with the company and with all sincerity, I want to thank 
everyone for making my last 2.5 years so much fun.  It really has been a 
blast and I hope we keep in touch.  As you know, I'll be at Northwestern next 
year so if you're in Chicago, please look me up.  Take care, I wish you guys 
all the best.  Here is my forwarding info, but first...

No Iaia email is complete without a cheesy, Italian quote:
And so I leave you with the immortal words of Francis Albert Sinatra:

"And now, the end is near;
and so I face the final curtin.
I ate it up and spit it out.  
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way."  

God bless that guy, anyway, here it is:

It's been fun. Y'all take care now, y'hear?
