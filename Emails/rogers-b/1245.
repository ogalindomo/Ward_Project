Jenny, Teresa, Amy:

I am leaving Enron at the end of next week. When you distribute your 
respective weekly/monthly reports (O&M, Capex, P&L), could you please forward 
them to Jinsung Myung and Ben Rogers, so that they can generate the weekly 
report that I have been generating while I am gone.

For the time being, please continue forwarding the reports to me. Thanks.
