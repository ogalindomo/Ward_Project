Look at this great idea that Kelly Strader and Charla Reese "cooked up."    
Charla made the arrangements for us, and she says that reservations are not 
required.  I hope you can all make it, and if you do, what will Jimmy do with 
all of us?  That's his problem - he invited us!  I'll send a reminder next 
week.
