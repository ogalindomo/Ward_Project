Attached is a redlined draft of the CA which includes the comments that I 
received from both Lance Schuler and Mark Metts.

Lance raised a very good point about the value of the standstill to Enron if 
ENA is a signatory to the agreement.  I will call Mark directly to discuss 
this issue but have attempted to highlight it for you in the revised draft.

Please feel free to call with any questions.
