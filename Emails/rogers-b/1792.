Edith,

- Substation location: Sayerville
- Gas: Transco Zone 6 (no additional cost for LDC)
- Unit contingent call
- 97% availability: It should be OK since we can assume 97% during summer 
time and 90~93% during non-summer time, for example.

Could you get the pricing for following scenario based on above assumption?

Flat and annual capacity payment for 3 and 5 year
With 16 hour block and 4 hour block

Please call me, if it doesn't make sense.
