Hi Ben!

Version 2 includes alot of data that wasn't used but you might find 
interesting.  It was gathered from a number of parties.  Version 3B is the 
last version I have, if Corp made changes, I don't have them.  

As you know the generation slide (slide 13) contains sensitive information, 
so please don't forward the file, or if you do, simple delete it from the 
presentation.

Thanks again for your help!
Tammy

I wanted to see if I could get a couple of the board presentation that you 
were working on, with regards to the generation information.  I wanted to see 
how it turned out.  Thanks!
