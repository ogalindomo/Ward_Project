Ben,

Thanks for the briefing.  We have your file here and I will add this
information so we have a complete "story".  Good luck with the GMAT and
keep in contact.

Jennifer:
     Thank you for the response and the update.  The news that Dr,
Harris
had left was news to me, since I had not received an auto-reply message.
Just to let you know, Dr Harris and I had talked quite a bit last year
about my application status.  I had also talked to many of the Finance
Professors, particularly Professor Sheridan Titman about the program and
my
application status.  Both Professor Titman and Dr Harris suggested that
I
take a finance class as well as retake the GMAT.  Due to my documented
learning disability, I am trying to receive a "special testing status"
from
GMAC and then re-take the GMAT.
     I hope this brief "download" of my previous conversations with Dr.
Harris and others at the Business School has helped.   I hope all is
going
well with the new school year and I look forward to hearing from you in
the
near future.

Regards,

Ben Rogers
