Ben -

 Here are my comments to the CA.  The only substantive comment has to
do with the procedure to follow in the event of a legal proceeding that
requires disclosure.  The procedure you proposed is a pretty tough standard
for us to follow, and I would prefer a procedure more along the lines I have
proposed.  Please let me know.  Thanks.
