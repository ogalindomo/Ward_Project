It has been said, =01&Friends are the thermometer by which we may judge the=

n, I=20
count myself among the most fortunate.  My sincere thanks to you who have=

given me so much over the past three years and touched my life in so many=
=20
ways.  I have found Enron to be a special place, full of remarkable=20
individuals, and will always have fond memories of my time here.

On Monday, I am going to Austin to join the George W. Bush campaign.  Durin=
