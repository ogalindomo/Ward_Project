Oscar-the 545 does not include an SCR.  I will need to check on the financial
interest and length of time.

Rich,

In working through our analysis for the revised proposal to Lincoln, I had the
following questions:

1.  In Lincoln's cost estimate of $545/kw, did this include SCR's?

2. Under taxable financing, what interest rate and repayment period would
Lincoln normally find acceptable?


Any input you could provide would be appreciated.


Thanks


Oscar
