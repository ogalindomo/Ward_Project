Here is some information I put together when I was working on the coal 
presentation.  The preliminary ecomonics tab looks at the dispatch spread 
between coal and natural gas and the difference in variable O&M for coal and 
natural gas plants.  

If you need a model for a coal plant, I would suggest talking to the 
Generation Investments group.  They are working on a deal where they are 
buying some coal plants (the Allstrom Deal) and have created models for coal 
plant ecomomics.  I believe Chuck Ward and Bill Keeney are spear-heading that 
effort.   

Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've sent you or if I 
can help you with anything else.



Thanks,
Rebecca
