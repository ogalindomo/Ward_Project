Could you please send us your latest operating model for Pastoria and LV 
Cogen? We are in the process of updating a spreadsheet to value the 
development projects. For now, we are concerned primarily with Net Income, 
Aftertax Cashflow, Capitalization, Capex and Debt Assumptions.

Also, since Winston is leaving for B-school soon, who should Ben and Jinsung 
contact for future modeling questionsconcerning Pastoria?


Thanks.
