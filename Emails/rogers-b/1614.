Mike:
My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a
certain gate # or the "will call window".  I will call your Dad next week
and set things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's
home number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a
great time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.
