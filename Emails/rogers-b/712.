Hey Ben! It's your Ma!? We just got back from  a nice dinner in Boston. It 
was good to get out. We're going over to the  Vineyard for the weekend, if 
you're looking for us. Do you have Monday  off?? Kara is home now. You might 
want to give her a call. I think she's  glad to be home but she has a lot to 
go through before she's in good  shape.? Have a good weekend! Love ya, Mom
