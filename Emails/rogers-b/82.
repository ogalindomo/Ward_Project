Don - the e-mail I just sent you which contain the termination letter of the 
Brownsville's stormwater construction permit provides the latest update on 
the NOV issue. As far as the noise issue - I am not sure what follow up they 
asked for.

I was expecting some further information on the stormwater NOVs (i.e.,
confirmation that corrective actions were completed), and a follow up on the
noise study.  Can you check on these items or correct my recollection.

Thanks
