It was really nice meeting you.  I'm glad that you enjoyed your visit.  I
apologize that you didn't get a chance to talk with Dr. Harris, but it
sounds like you have addressed that issue in your essays.  Best of luck

Regards
Meg

     Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also,
thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my
application and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of
the faculty and staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the
School, my desire to attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a
perfect fit for the career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a
institution where I would be able to contribute to and learn from the
energy-finance program due to my experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have
tested poorly on tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the rest of my
application is quite strong and that I have proven that I can successfully
compete in a competitive environment (ie. Enron).  I excel in environments
(team-oriented) such as described by the many people I talked with at the
Texas B-School.
     Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application
and it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now
living in Texas, such as myself.

Regards,

Ben Rogers
