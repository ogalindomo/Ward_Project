Yvan,

According to Dave Botchlett, we should be able to use the Low Sulfur HO curve 
that is in the file I've given you in the past with the 3 cent transport cost 
over the NYH mean.  

He did a question:   Can we ship the oil into the plant on barges or on cargo 
ships as opposed to trucking?

Attached is the updated file
