Who ever has Cliff and Deirdre should get the kind of VCR that marks the
commercials and when you play back the recorded TV show, it SKIPS the
commercials.  Yes, technology is a wonderful thing.  Everyone witnessed it
here when we watched a taped episode of the West Wing.  It's a little extra,
but well worth it.
