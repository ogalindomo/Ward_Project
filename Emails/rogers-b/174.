Ben and Jinsung,

Below are my calculations for run-hours and annual MWs.  The starts/year is 
an estimate and fuel use/start are estimates only.  I would say that these 
estimates are conservative and are used to make sure that emissions are kept 
below limits.

 Heat Rate Basis:
 Unit 1 & 2 - 11,200
 Unit  3 & 4 - 11,800

 Output Basis:
 Unit 1 & 2 - 115 MW
 Unit 3 & 4 - 125 MW

 Emissions Limits:
 NOx - 249 tons/yr
 CO - 225 tons/yr
 Fuel - 7,127,857 MMBtu/yr
