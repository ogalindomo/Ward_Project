For those of you who might be working on LM6000 transactions, there is a 
rough cut of a standardized Financial Model and a old Capital Cost 
Configuration Model that you can use for current/future LM6000 projects. Both 
of them are saved as read-only at o:/naes/from_ko_LM6000/control. If you do 
not have access, please compose a Security Request via Lotus Notes.

Please note that there are still work to be done on both models. If you are 
assigned with any LM6000 models, please keep me in the loop, and I can fill 
you in on the model progress and process. 

Thanks.
