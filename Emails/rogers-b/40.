Ben and Ross:
I briefly spoke with Don Miller this morning and he mentioned that the 
Transition Team meeting with Allegheny may take place this Thursday. Please 
let me know if there's anything you need me to do to help coordinate this 
effort. 

Thanks,
Jennifer

Everyone:
Attached is the list of the preliminary Allegheny/Enron transition team 
members for the 2000 Peaker assets.  If you think you should not be on it or 
that someone else is better suited for the task then please let me know.  
Please check over the information to make sure everything is correct.  We are 
trying to plan for a kick-off meeting with Allegheny within the next couple 
of weeks.  Thanks for your assistance with this very important project.
