Thanks for the message.  I am surprised to have run into you and brandon at
otto's - we never see each other there.  That was a joke.

Great luck with that marathon.  That will be awesome I am sure.  I am signed
up for austin in feb, so I am pretty excited about that one.

Let me know how it goes!  Talk to you later...

DC

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to
send you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great
eveything is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my
weekends are mostly about running, but after that I would like to get
together for some golf.  Talk to you soon.
Ben
