Junell,

Thanks for the pictures.  You are the man.  I'll be waiting for the rest of
them.  Make sure to add Ben Rogers to your email distribution.  I cc'ed him
on this so you'd have his address.  I look forward to seeing you at the
wedding shower and the wedding if you can make it.  Thanks again, buddy.

- Bryan
