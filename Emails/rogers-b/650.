Here are the contents of the damaged floppy disk.  It
looks like there are multiple indices for some of the
projects.  I have included all the files, so we can sort
through to see which are the correct ones to use.  I'm
assuming that these files are not corrupted.  My machine
is too old to be able to open them.  And yet it was
sophisticated enough to recover the files.

I can only attach 5 files to an e-mail, so I'll have to
send them in multiple batches.
