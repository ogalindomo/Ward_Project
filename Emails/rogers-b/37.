Benjamin,

Hopefully, you will get credit or at least some recognition for the
important role you played. But you shouldn't be terribly disappointed if you
don't.  I have found in business that you don't always get credit for the
things that you truly achieved and yet sometimes you get more credit for
things than you believe that you deserved.  The relationship between
contribution and credit is often difficult to predict and sometimes defies
logic.

I believe you stepped in and made a meaningful difference in this deal.

Dad

Dad:
Thanks for talking to Cyrus for me.  I hope that will be enough to get Dave
and Don to promote me to manager, since I clearly deserve it with this
transaction. I don't think there as been a manager, much less an Associate
(my level)  has done a deal like this and that is exactly what I am going
to tell Don Miller and Dave Delainey.  Our PRC meetings our going on right
now and I trying to get this done right away.  Thanks again for taking the
time to talk to Michael.
