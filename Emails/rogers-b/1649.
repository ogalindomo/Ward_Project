Greetings, Mr. Rogers

I wish to inform you that your fall 2000 application for admission to the
TEXASMBA in The Graduate School of Business at The University of Texas at
Austin has now completed its formal review.  I regret your application has
not been successful, and that you are not being extended an offer of
admission.

The competitiveness of this year's applicant pool has made it an extremely
challenging quest for each of our 3,000 applicants.  Unfortunately, there
are only 420 seats available for the new class to fill.

I do wish to thank you for your interest in the TEXASMBA, and I wish you the
very best in both your personal and professional aspirations for the future.
