i should be here most of this week unless i get called up to NY city. If i
make it down to houston will call you. I had an old GE Capital friend over
for dinner this week with his family. Tom Kalb works at Enron now and lives
around the corner from me. Not sure what group he is, he seemed to suggest
he just got transferred and is now in some finance group. take care. charlie
