Edith,

I talked to Tom Swank today on the Synthetic Combined Cycle. Tom wants to 
have the capacity payment numbers based off of mid and bid curve as well as 
offer curve for indicative proposal to Aquila. Carl told me that you already 
ran the model one month ago. Is it relevant idea? Let me know your thought. 
Thank you.
