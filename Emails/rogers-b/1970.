Hey Clement & Ben, got your calls -- sorry haven't returned them yet, but I'm 
swamped this week --> LM6000 marathon-o-rama. How's tomorrow afternoon 
sometime 3-5pm? If there are no rooms available in EB, I can probably get one 
over here in 3AC fairly easily. We can review both estimates if you like. Let 
me know if this works for you all.

Scot:

I would like to further discuss the analysis and format you have provided us 
for Lincoln and Santee Cooper. Besides me, I might include George McCormick, 
Ben Rogers, and Doug Sewell in the meeting. 

Please let me know your availability and I would set up a meeting room. 
Thanks.
