The time has finally arrived for me to leave the working world - tomorrow 
(7/28) is my last day at Bank United - and I will soon be leaving for 
Evanston, so I thought I'd pass along some info if you need to reach me.

I'll be in Houston until around August 23rd or so.  My home # is (713) 
665-5792.  I can also be reached at the parents' house at (281) 920-3113.  No 
more cell phone for now - drat!  My email address (until I get up to school) 
is: cbmcwherter@yahoo.com .

My contact info in Evanston is:

1600 Hinman, Apt. 1M
Evanston, Illinois 60201

(847) 869-7988


I'll forward my Kellogg e-mail address when I get it in September.  If you 
ever want to come up and check out Chicago, catch a game at Wrigley, or 
donate money to the McWherter Scholarship Fund, please let me know.  I'll be 
more than happy to take a break from the world of academia and do whatever.

I'm sure I'll see most of you before I leave, but if not, take care and I 
wish you the best.

Blake
