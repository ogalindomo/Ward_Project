Benjamin:

>My name is Ben Rogers and I am currently applying to
The Texas Business School.
I am coming to visit the
school on Friday, Feb. 18th and was wondering if you had time to talk to
me about the Energy/Corporate Finance Program.

I would be pleased to meet with you in the morning hours of Fri.
