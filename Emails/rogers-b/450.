The outage schedule is in your hand for the DPL questions.  The outage report 
for this outage can't be complete until the outage is over.  The outage 
should be over around Nov. 5.  If the current outage schedule is what you're 
looking for then you have it.  I can send it electronic if you have microsoft 
project..
