Hey friends:

As most of you already know, I had left Enron recently to embark on my MBA
program this coming fall. Sorry I don't have the time to visit with all of
you individually to bid farewell, and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank each and everyone of you for all your help and support over the
past 3 years I had been at Enron.

I am currently visiting my family and friends in Singapore, before heading
back to Houston to drive up to Boston. You can reach me at this permanent
email address, or alternatively, the following after 8/23/00:

636 HBS Student Mail Center
Boston, MA 02163-7807
(617) 493-1816
klau@mba.hbs2002.edu

Hope everything is well with all of you. Please keep in touch and take great
care of yourselves!

Best regards.

-Clement


p.s. Look for me if you are going to be in Boston area!
