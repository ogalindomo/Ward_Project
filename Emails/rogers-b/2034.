Attached are the Final 1999 Weekly Cost Summary and Draw Schedule for the 99 
Peakers.  Going forward, I will only be issuing these reports once a month 
since the Peakers are 99.6% complete and we are only waiting on a few 
straggling costs ($1.6MM).  Please call me if you have any questions.


Thanks,
