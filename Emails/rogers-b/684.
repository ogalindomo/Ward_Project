Southern Energy has decided NOT to pursue the assets in the Mid-West

CSFB of this decision.  Thanks!

Barbara:
If you could send me a list of people and their cell phone numbers who are
going to the sites as well as exact times that you will be there, I would
appreciate it.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.
Thanks!
