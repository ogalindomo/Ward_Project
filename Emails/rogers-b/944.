I've finished with Wilton Center.  Here's my highlighted index.  Once again, 
I've probably included too many documents (land, rough cost estimates, etc).

Tomorrow I'll get started on the '99s.  Hopefully we can get a fairly quick 
turnaround on these to get scanned in again.  If we can get these documents 
skimmed through in two days (tomorrow and Wednesday), we should be in good 
shape to get everything scanned in and done by Friday.  Keep your fingers 
crossed.
