Don:

Again, thanks for dropping by. A little "face time" can go along way!

Enjoy your night and weekend. I will be in D.C. most of next week, but
leave me
a message here at the office if you need to reach me.

I continue to feel strongly that we can work out an arrangement that is a
win-win for both
parties. But in keeping with our strategy ( and your recommendation), we
will proceed with CSFB
as planned until we have something else with which to work and "sink our
teeth" into.

Thanks againl. I appreciate your persistence and diligence.

Tom
