Don,

Currently, our model assumes total project cost of $558/kW (EPC: $509/kW with 
turbine cost of $303/kW, Soft cost: $45/kW, Financing cost: $5/kW) . I think 
$558/kW may be too conservative (compare to what I have been hearing), so I 
ran some sensitivities on project cost as follows. The result is not 
negligible. See you tomorrow.

Regards,

Jinsung
