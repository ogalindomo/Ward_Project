Subject: Re: Calpine Indicative Pricing  


1.  How much would this pricing change if power could be called ion 4 hour 
blocks and the availability percentages were 97%?

2.  What pricing does the 20 year project model show that we need?

3.  What additional information do you need from me to complete your analysis?
