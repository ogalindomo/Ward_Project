Attached are some water info.  Mike Wisdom (EE&CC) probably has the original 
documentation, but I can't reach him.  Ben, you may want to keep trying.

Subject: Water analysis for Gleason and Wheatland

Mitch,

The attached files contain the info.  

For Gleason:  All I have is the water specs that Mike Wisdom placed in the 
RFQ that went to Ecolochem and US Filter; I do not have copies of the 
original source documentation.

Let me know if you need more.

Norris
