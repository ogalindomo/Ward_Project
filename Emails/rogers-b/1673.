Greetings, Mr. Rogers

My thanks for your prompt and thoughtful reply.

As I interpret your note, it is not your desire to accept our offer to
retake the GMAT at this time.  Accordingly, I will be adding this latest
addition to your application packet.

Apart from what you have already submitted, is there any other new
material(s) you wish to be considered in the applications final review?

Carl
