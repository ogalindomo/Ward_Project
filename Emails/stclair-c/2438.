Directions to Sienna Plantation
1-10 to the Sam Houston tollway south, go south.  Stay on the Sam Houston
tollway past Hwy 59 and exit South Main (Hwy 90) and turn right to Murphy
Road.  Turn left onto Murphy Road and stay on Murphy Road until you get to
Hwy 6 and then turn left.  Take Hwy 6 to Sienna Parkway and turn right onto
Sienna Parkway.  Go approximately three miles and after you go over the
railroad tracks turn right onto Sienna Trace.  You will see the courts after
you turn onto Sienna Trace. The early lines start at 7:30 and it will take at
least 1 hour to get there so anyone interested in leaving from the club
should meet at 6:15, please.  Beth is the only person playing at 8:15 but I
am staying until she is finished so anyone wishing to stay can catch a ride
home.
