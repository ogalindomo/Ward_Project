Great for the home or office - this space-saving AM/FM CD system is picture 
frame thin, so it can be mounted on a wall or displayed on its raised stand.

This unique fork has a built-in thermometer that reads the cooking 
temperature of the meat to tell you when it's cooked to your desired taste, 
from rare to well done.

best organized, most complete set you'll find.
