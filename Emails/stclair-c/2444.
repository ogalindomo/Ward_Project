Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

My assistant will be calling you to set up a time next week when Ken Curry
and I can discuss your comments with you and your credit person.  Her name
is Suzanne Adams.
