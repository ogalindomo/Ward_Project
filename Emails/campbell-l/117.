Subject: Ground Water Contamination

George,  The Eunice Team has been activitly involved in the well testing for 
ground water contamination for quite    sometime now and know of some of the 
controversy regarding the Eunice Compressor Station.

  Recently Dynegy has undertaking a project to remove a 10" low pressure sour 
gas pipeline in the     Southwest area of our station outside of our fence 
line.  There are two monitoring wells in this location and    the presence 
of  contamination seems to be increasing in this area.  We took some 
pictures  of this area 
  while Dynegy was in the process of removing their pipe.  There appears to 
be quite abit of contamination    and seemed be generated by the condition of 
the pipe as you will see in the pictures.

  If you have any questions please give us a call.

  Thanks
  Ray Noseff
