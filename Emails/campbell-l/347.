Here are the individual plot plans for 1 and 2.



M3-1A.dwg & .tif are the station 1 plot plans. M3-1B.dwg & .tif are the 
station 2 plot plans. The files need to be placed in the same directory. You 
would open the .dwg file in Autocad and it will bring in the related .tif to 
complete the drawing.

Thanks
Mike
