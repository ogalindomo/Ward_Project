Larry,
Just thought that I would write to tell you that we  really enjoyed your 
visit. also, we just found out that my Dad passed away this  afternoon (Wed) 
at about 1:30 PM. I would have called but what is there to say.  At least he 
will not be in? pain any more. Apparantly they had just  finished lunch at 
their new house in Silver City when he just fell over in his  chair. Anyway 
we will be leaving in the morning as mother wants to have the  funeral on Sat 
in Hillsboro. I know you are busy so do not  even?consider?coming to the 
funeral.Anyway tell the kids? that  while we enjoyed seeing you, we ?really 
missed seeing them. Hope all is  well. If you need something we will have 
Jans cell (801) 362-1108. Give Teddy  and everyone our love.
Rick
