Gentlemen:
?
We look forward to getting your Nov. 10 hourly  deals. If you would, please 
set up an email list with:
?
bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com
ellen.clardy@ipgdirect.com??  Phone # is 713/647-6603
suzanna.strangmeier.@ipgdirect.com?  Phone # is 713/647-7325
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com?  (The latter is our shared, group email  
address.)
?
Thanks so much for your cooperation and rest  assured, we're endeavoring to 
get the Cin index out by 9:15 a.m. each weekday.  Is that the optimum time, 
getting the index out after options  expire?
?
This will take some time, getting people to  cooperate, but we will prevail.
?
Also, please note we're collecting historicals for  ComEd, TVA and SPP, if 
you want to include those deals (no indicative necessary  at this time).
?
Thanks, guys! As always, call if we can be of  assistance--
Bobette
