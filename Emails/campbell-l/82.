Subject: Matrix W.O. ST9114 - WT1 Control Valve Bypass


Gentlemen,

Please obtain proper ROW & environmental permits for the attached project.  
It consists of approx 25 ft of 12" pipe and block valve inside the WT1 
Station yard.  There will be a hydrotest.  And there will be minor excavation 
for the supports.

Butch, do I need to send in a USGS map for this?

Thanks Jim
