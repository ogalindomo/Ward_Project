Subject:  Cancellation of May 1, 2001 BS&P call on credit policy

We previously agreed to hold a conference call meeting May 1 in
anticipation of having sufficient progress from the Credit Policy Working
Group (CPWG) to review.  After speaking with Andy Ragogna this afternoon, I
do not believe the CPWG is close enough to a detailed proposal to have a
productive conference, after all.  Consequently, I am canceling the May 1 
call.

Additionally, it appears unlikely at this point we will have a proposal
ready for the May 10 Management Committee  meeting. My report will simply
be a progress report on the Credit Policy issue, and a report on our plans
to develop this year's budget and goals recommendations.

Chair BS&P
