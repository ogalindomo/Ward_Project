Here are some suggestions:

1.  Exclude the remediation system equipment: 350 bbl AST and equipment 
building with air compressor.
2.  We will need unrestricted access 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week to monitor and 
service the remediation system and monitor wells.
3.  The electric power drop for the remediation equipment is separate from 
the facility so this shouldn't be a problem.
4.  The remediation system does not utilize compressed air or natural gas 
from the facility so this shouldn't be a problem.
5.  Reserve the right to deed record the location of contaminated soil and 
groundwater.
6.  Reserve the right to construct additional wells and/or facilities to 
faciliate remediation efforts.
7.  Reserve the right to irrigate recovered groundwater on-site.
