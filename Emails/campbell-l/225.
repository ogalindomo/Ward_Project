Subject: 2001 Domestic Audit Calendar

Attached for your information and planning is the projected ETS audit 
calendar for 2001.  As you can see there are a few changes in the calendar 
for next year. This year we welcome Don Bruce to the audit program.  Don 
joins Enron Quality Management from the EOTT organization as an additional 
Audit Director.  As can be seen, we have blended the EOTT assets into the ETS 
calendar.  Next year ETS will be going to a four year rotation for auditing 
team assets therefore, we have scheduled and will be conducting forty-two 
domestic audits.  

Major changes are also happening within our program design for 2001. First, 
five unannounced audits will be conducted giving management a picture of how 
well the assets are being operated on a day to day basis.   Also, new to the 
program this year, the  audits conducted by our audit teams will be scored .  
In January we are introducing a new electronic format to the audit process.  
This new computerized program should greatly enhance the audit process by 
giving EQM the capability of:

Producing enhanced audit reports
Generating site specific verification points (formally questions)
Producing statistical graphs and data
Scoring by category or total audit 
Increasing objectivity
Generating historical data for review

Enron Quality Management is enthuastically looking forward to 2001and the 
progressive program that we have outlined to help ensure "quality management" 
of our gas and liquid facilities.  During this holiday season we would like 
to take this opportunity to extend to each of you and your families the 
happiest of holidays and a progressive and prosperous new year.
