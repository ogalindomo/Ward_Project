We have acquired right of way with the following land owners:
Area Energy
Kern Water Bank Authority
West Kern Water District
Buena Vista Water Storage District
Kern County Water Authority
Southern California Edison
State of California for Interstate-5 and State Highway-43 crossings.

The only property owned by the State are the highway crossings. The Kern
River by-pass channel is in the middle of  West Kern property, right of way
for crossing it is with West Kern. There are permits Larry is working on
with the Army Corp of Engineers for stream bed alteration but I do not
think the state owns the property. I will do some checking and clear this
up.

Rick can you check on the land that the Ro Gas pipeline will be going
through and see if this is State land or who owns it? This will drive  what
permits or agencies we will need to deal with. Copy Larry on all
information.
Thanks
Rich
