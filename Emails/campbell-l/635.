Good news.  The original manufacture date of the turbine installed at 
Keystone is 2/18/69.  Solar will be sending me a letter to this effect.

Ms. Jensen,

The turbine power section serial #0921-97-P was installed at Keystone.  It
appears to be a 1997 model but can you confirm this through your Solar
contact.
