Subject: Performance Review Process

As you know, the performance review process is currently underway.  If you 
have not already done so, please go into the performance review system and 
select individuals to give feed back on your performance during this review 
period.  Generally, it is recommended to select 6-8 reviewers.  The system 
closes for feedback on November 17th.  Attached, please find the Performance 
Management Guide to assist with the process.  Should you have questions, 
please do not hesitate to contact me at x57273.
