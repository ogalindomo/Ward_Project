Subject: NERC Training schedule

Mitch attached you will find the schedule for the NERC training . I will need 
room 3109 next to the control room for the weeks listed as classroom 
training. Kayne and Lloyd please share this schedule with all interested 
parties in your group. I will rely on you to have your people attend the 
training as listed or advise me of any problems.
Thanks,
Keith
