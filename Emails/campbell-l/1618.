Not that many of you care.? But since I am  moving to Tulsa, my computer will 
be down for awhile and my email is going to be  shut off this Friday.? 
Therefore, I am going to have to move over to my  hotmail account.? The 
address is scotlilly@hotmail.com? However,  because of the limited space on 
hotmail, I will have to ask you not to send  (large) forwards for awhile.? I 
will write everybody when I get a new ISP  and tell you guys the new 
address.?
