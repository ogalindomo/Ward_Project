Can someone shed any light on how much generation was on May 1 out of
merit?  I thought all such requests, whether by the Transmission
Provider or the ISO, were to be posted on the Dispatcher Notices.  There
were no notices posted between 04:03:58 and 21:50:53.  In that time
period I had gas turbines requested on by the ISO out of merit for 7
hours.  Was this done on a larger scale or was this an isolated
incident?
