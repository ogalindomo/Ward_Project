Christi,
?
Here is the paper  you wanted.
?
All,
?
This excellent and  easy to read paper makes a good argument as to why 
continuously clearing markets  are more efficient than single price 
(ISO/PX-like) regimes.? I've already  sent a few of you hardcopy, but Christi 
and I thought it would be good for all  to read.
