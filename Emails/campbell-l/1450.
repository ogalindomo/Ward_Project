Clarification of the Filing requirements :

Section 6-106 of the Energy Law of New York State

Each year certain loading-serving entities and generation providers are
required to file certain operating data with the New York State
Energy Planning Board under Section 6-106 of the Energy Law of
New York State.  The year 2001 filing deadline for this information
is July 1, 2001.  The NYISO will continue to function as reporting
agent for Market Participants.



ESCO's that neither generate nor distribute electricity are not required to
provide the Section 6-106 information.  It is assumed that the ESCO has a
process in place to convey their forecast inputs to the Transmission Owner(s).

For those New York Market Participants desiring to report this
operating information through the NYISO, please review the
attached document that describes the process for submitting data
to the NYISO.
