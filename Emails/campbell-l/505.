We have received written approval from both the OCD and the NMED for the soil 
characterization plan that was submitted for sampling soil in the former 
surface impoundment area located at the northeast corner of the facility. A 
work plan for excavation and disposal of affected soil will be prepared 
subsequent to completion of the soil characterization plan. A tentative 
schedule is as follows:
? Meet with the Team and the contractor (Gandy) at the site on August 29th
? Collect soil samples for characterization on September 5th and 6th. Bill 
Olson with the OCD has indicated that he would like to be present for these 
activities.
? Receive lab results by September 21st
? Submit excavation work plan by October 5th

Whether or not we can complete the excavation work this year will be largely 
dependent upon obtaining a quick approval of an excavation work plan. The 
timing will be tight but it can be done.
