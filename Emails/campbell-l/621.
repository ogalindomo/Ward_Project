Theiler, thought I would drop you a line and let you know how the hunt went.  
When Ryan and I got to the ranch, the guide gave us both a bull tag instead 
of a cow tag and said we had the run of the ranch and we could shoot anything 
we wanted, bulls or cows.  I took your word and didnt shoot your gun, which 
was a duel mistake, trusting your word and trusting your gun.  I saw several 
big bulls during our 4 day stay on the ranch and am reporting to you that due 
to my trust in you, and that jap junk rifle,  I never hit anything. Have you 
had anything in your life that would compare to the emptiness and frustration 
of shooting at monster bulls for four days and not hitting anything but dirt 
and trees?  Not only that, but on the way home, I wreaked my truck and died 
on the way to the hospital.  Im in heaven now, and spending my time putting 
the mojo hex on all your future hunts.  However, now I know why you always 
wanted to hunt with me, cause everyone else that you know and likes to hunt,  
you have given the same line of garbage about how good of a hunter you are 
and that  your gun shots true.....

Now for the true story.  I didnt shoot a cow, but Ryan did.  I never saw the 
30 inch mule deer, but we saw lots and lots of deer and elk.  I can 
understand why people pay to hunt on private land.  This ranch was a mixture 
of the Vi Vidal and the Baca location.  Lots of big open meadows and
