Mr. Campbell,

49 CFR 195 addresses regulations for the transportation of hazardous liquids
by pipelines.  Attached are some of the regs that specify applicability,
defnitions, and tank inspection requirements.  I don't see any exemptions
from the inspection requirements for breakout tanks.  Let me know if you
need more in-depth analysis of the DOT regs.
