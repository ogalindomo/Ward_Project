Dear Market Participant,

The NYISO publishes and maintains a library of Technical Bulletins that 
explain
changes in and provide instruction relating to NYISO processes and procedures.
These Technical Bulletins are meant to supplement the NYISO Manuals and are
incorporated into the manuals as the manuals are periodically updated.  Market
Participants are invited to comment on NYISO Technical Bulletins at any time
during the life cycle of the Technical Bulletin.  Technical Bulletins are
located on the NYISO web site at
http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html.

Comments pertaining to new and/or existing Technical Bulletins should be
forwarded via email to:
