The product recovery system was shut down on September 8th due to excessive 
production of water. This system was shut down pending the installation new 
recovery pumps which would minimize production of water. The new pumps have 
been purchased and are on-site, however, in the time period since September 
8th, PSH has accumulated in only one of the three on-site recovery wells. In 
light of this, installation of the new recovery pumps will be postponed until 
additional recovery wells have been installed.
