The Texas Railroad Commission has posted new versions of two spill cleanup 
guidelines: 

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident, and

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-Sensitive 
Areas

on its web site at 
http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/divisions/og/notices-pubs-swr/notices/ogpn70.html. 
 Copies of the two quidelines in html formal are also attached to this notice.

The introductory page on the web site states: "To ensure consistent 
interpretation of Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91, as they pertain to crude oil 
and condensate spills, the RRC has issued two field sampling guidance 
documents....Both of the field guides describe reporting, sampling and 
analysis requirements as well as provide the default cleanup concentrations.  
In all cases an apppropriate risk assessment may be used in lieu of the 
defaullt cleanup concentrations".

The guidelines are effective November 1, 2000.  The condensate guideline is 
temporary until the RBCA guidelines become available.  The Texas Railroad 
Commission plans to issue the RBCA guidelines by the end of this year.
