With all that has been going through about the price change for the
16th, I have one question that I would like to have clarified for
future reference.  Suppose that I had bid to export power from NYISO to
PJM and put in a sink price cap of -900.00.  Suppose that then I got
accepted as the price cleared at less than -900.00.  The power was then
scheduled with NYISO and subsequently scheduled with PJM, creating
financial obligations on both ends.  What would happen to the economics
of this schedule in this case?
