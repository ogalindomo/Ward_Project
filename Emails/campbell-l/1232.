I've emailed my friend my review for Finding Forrester, starring Sean
Connery, Anna Paquin and newcomer Rob Brown.  You can wait until he posts
the review on his website or just email me for the review.  I think he's
pretty busy since he hasn't posted my review for Unbreakable yet.

In any case, the url for the movie review site is:
http://users.ev1.net/~solt/movie_menu.html

book mark it and check back for reviews of future movies.
