Dear Larry,

I am mailing the Part 71 application for La Plata A to you today.  I am
attaching the cover letter to the EPA for you to print out onto your
letterhead.  Please note that carbon monoxide emissions are included in
threshold applicability, however, they are not included for fee purposes,
therefore your fees for La Plata are based on NOx, SO2, VOC, and PM10.
 Also as a reminder, the letter from the EPA requested the application by
October 11, 1999.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Mary
