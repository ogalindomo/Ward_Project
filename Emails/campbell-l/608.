The Environmental Affairs Department is developing a list of ETS natural gas 
pipeline facilities where the  condensate throughput exceeds 30,000 
gallons/year.  In the coming weeks, the Division Environmental Specialists 
will be asking your operating teams for annual condensate throughput at all 
facilities.  Please impress upon the teams the importance of collecting and 
providing this information as we have committed to a first quarter 2002 
deadline to compile the list.  This request is especially critical in areas 
prior to processing as the likelihood of the annual condensate throughput to 
exceed 30,000 gallons/year increases in those areas.

Please  call me at (402) 398-7716 or email me if you have any questions about 
this request.  Thank you for your help!
