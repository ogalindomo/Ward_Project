Subject: Engines and GF Status

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.

Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields
