Subject: NYISO  publishes hourly charges


All,
?
At long last,  NYISO has begun publishing hourly charges per MWh (and the 
costs/revenues used  to develop the charges) for ancillary services etc., 
which can be found  at:
?
http://mis.nyiso.com/public/S-3list.htm
?
We have been  requesting?for well over a year that this information be 
posted.?  For now, the charges only go back to November 1, 2000.
