Well, Boys-

Turn out the lights, the party's over...  

I just thought I'd drop you guys an "official" note telling you that I am 
leaving Enron to take another position at a "Tier II" shop.  Hopefully, I 
will be able to help turn it around and make it a "Tier I" shop like Enron 
(Dreamers can dream, can't they?).  Anyways, I wanted you guys to know that I 
really enjoyed working with ya'll over the past year or so and really wish 
things could have worked out with the contract, salary, etc...  I really hate 
to have to move on because ya'll are such a great group and I have enjoyed 
working here with you so much however, I must pay the bills, keep the wife 
happy and keep me fed so, Off I go...

Well, Good Luck to you Guys and I look forward to talking to you Guys soon.  

BTW, Keep in touch for Happy Hours, etc (I am still willing to drink with you 
guys even though I am not a member of the Lazy E employment troop...) and 
please forward this to anyone I missed.

Late.
