Dear Market Participants,

Please note the NYISO online systems will become unavailable tonight
between 7:00 pm (19:00) and 7:15 pm (19:15) for a hardware/software
upgrade to the Internet security systems.

A fallback plan is in place in the event any problems are encountered
so your access to services will resume on schedule.

Regards,
Customer Relations
