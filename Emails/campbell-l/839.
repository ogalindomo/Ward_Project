Subject: VaR Model

Attached below is the Excel-based VaR Calculator that allows VaR calculations 
for up to 5 different curves and/or products. The results may be different 
that those generated in the "official" VaR model, because it does not reflect 
all the intricacies. We have developed an Ad-hoc VaR model that allows quick 
calculations of VaR for a potential transaction, as well as the incremental 
VaR on a given portfolio (using the "official" VaR model). We will make this 
tool available to you via http://rac.enron.com/ in the near future (pending 
IT implementation).



TJ,

I do not have a list of names of all the traders on the desk (individuals who 
attended the VaR presentation). Could you please forward this e-mail to them.

Feel free to call me with any questions. Vlady.
