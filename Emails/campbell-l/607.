Here's a listing of the permits expiring over the next year or so:

 GW-90  Portales C.S.  Expires 2/27/02
 GW-89  Corona C.S.  Exprers 3/9/02
 GW-95  Laguna C.S.  Expires 3/9/02
 GW-109 Carlsbad C.S.  Expires 5/18/02
 GW-110 Mountainair C.S. Expires 5/18/02
 GW-113 Eunice C.S.  Expires 6/19/02
 GW-283 Jal C.S.   Expires 6/24/02
 GW-285 Bisti C.S.  Expires 9/24/02

As you know, if you get your renewal applications in 120 prior to the
expiration date, the permit will not expire on the dates above, but will
extend until all paperwork is done on my end.

We need to go out and look at all of these at some point in time, but I will
get back with you to set up a schedule.

Take care and have a good Thanksgiving.
