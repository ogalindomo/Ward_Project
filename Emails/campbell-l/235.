We have found the form in Gary's office. We are in the process of completing 
the form and will have in the mail today. Do you want me to call Mike?

 I certainly don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I am concerned that 
this may be yet another item that just dropped from the radar screen once 
Gary left.  (Because Gary did not prepare the transition memo that I asked 
for, we may only find out about certain tasks we have not completed through 
notices like this from agenies.  It goes without saying that this is less 
than desirable.)  Do you know anything about this specific filing for DOG?  
(It must pertain to our injection wells, as they are the only wells I know 
about that we own.)  Please let me know as soon as you can so I can call 
Glinzak and work something out re our past due filings.

  As for EH&S generally, I guess all I can suggest is to try to have Scott, 
you and me prepare a list of things we know will have to be dealt with on a 
recurring basis (such as these reports, source testing, etc.,) and be 
prepared to discuss them next week in Long Beach -- along with the issue of 
who exactly at ETS is/are going to be responsible for performing these 
specific tasks and the EH&S function generally.  Thanks.

Ed - I took a call from Mike Glinzak of the O&G Division (tele# 
661-322-4031).  He was looking for EOTT 3Q and 4Q 2000 quarterly well 
production filings (Form 110).  I believe these forms had previously been 
filed by Gary Fuller for the wells at North Coles Levee.  He said it was a 
"courtesy" call, but also noted that interest and late filing penalties would 
soon be issued on the 3Q report which apparently is past due.  Can you figure 
out where we stand with this and get back to him (or put him in touch with 
proper individual)?  Let me know if I can be of assistance. Thanks, JZ
