Hi Larry,

Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check 
back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
