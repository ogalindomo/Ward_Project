Dear Market Participants,

On Saturday May 12, 2001, the NYISO experienced higher than
normal LBMP's in real-time operation for those zones east of the
Central-East interface.
A scheduled maintenance outage of the Edic-New Scotland 345kV
transmission facility, in addition to unanticipated generating
resource outages, resulted in higher than normal congestion
associated with the Central-East interface.
