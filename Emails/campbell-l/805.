Please log on today or tomorrow to set up those that will be providing me 
feedback on your performance.  A few notes:

1.  Make sure you include Kayne.
2.  Make sure you include the Cash/Term trader with whom you have had the 
most contact within the last 6 months.
3.  Include several other hourly guys.
4.  Include others from other groups (for example: scheduling, settlements, 
origination, etc), but only if you have had professional contact within the 
last 6 months.
