KeySpan Energy Delivery of New York and Long Island will be conducting a
meeting in our Metrotech Brooklyn offices on Wednesday, May 16th to
discuss our proposed winter capacity program. I have attached a brief
overview of the proposed program for your review. It is important for
you as an active gas Marketer in KeySpan's service territory to have the
appropriate representative of your company attend this important
meeting. This will be your opportunity to present your views as well as
have any operational questions answered. The meeting will begin at 10:00
am and a light continental breakfast will be served. To confirm your
attendance and obtain directions to our offices, please contact Pat
Rubertone at (718) 403-3136.
