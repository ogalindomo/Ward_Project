Discussion List:

Consistent with our discussion yesterday, the Generation Issues Focus Group
Meeting on 12/13 is cancelled.  At our last meeting we made significant
progress on the issues.  While there is more work to be done, the next
meeting of the focus group should be after the S&P working group meeting on
12/18.
