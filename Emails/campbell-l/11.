There are two different sizes of filters at Topock

1.  At PG&E there is one 54 inch ID X 17'-6" Horizontal filter separator.  
This separator has 74 elements to it.  They are 4 1/2" OD by 72" long.

2.  At the Selexol plant there are two 48" IDX17"-6" Horizontal filter 
separators.  These separators have 52 elements to each.  They are the same 
size filter as above.

I will be sending a copy of the purchase orders these have all the 
dimensions.  One of these sheet show that the filter elements are 76" long 
this is incorrect.  They are 72" long.

We will talk to you later.  We will be on our way to Kingman in the morning.
