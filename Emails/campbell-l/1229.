Dear Market Participants,

It has been brought to our attention that a mistake was made on the Bid Form 
for
ICAP Auctions.  A corrected version of the Bid Form will be posted to the 
NYISO
Website as soon as possible.  The description for entering the dollars per
kilowatt hour incorrectly states per 6 months on the Monthly Auction sheets.
Please enter dollars per kilowatt per 1 month.
