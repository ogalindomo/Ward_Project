As a follow up to my October 23rd e-mail to you concerning the EDI
Collaborative's filing, I am attaching the NYS Public Service
Commissions Notice Soliciting Comments The notice includes the web
location of the filing and explains how you can file comments. Once
again, this will be your only chance to let the Commission know if you
disagree with any of the proposals. If approved by the Commission, the
rules for enrollments and drops will be adopted for statewide use early
in 2001.
