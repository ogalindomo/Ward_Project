We will have our mandatory monthly meeting on Tuesday November 28th,2000.  
Please bring any innovations or suggestions.  Don't forget that we do more 
before 6 a.m. than most do all day.  There will be a happy hour afterwards so 
lets try to have 100% participation for once.  Except for the night guys 
ofcourse.

Thanks
BIG DADDY
