Subject: Logon Changed Effective Immediately


Hi Larry,

      We had to change your logon this morning. With the new release of
our software, the "&" does not translate well on your logon.

      Effective 8/30/00 your new logon is:

      PGEES-TE

      The password has been changed to match.

thanks
