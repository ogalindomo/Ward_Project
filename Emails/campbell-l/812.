Okay....

The plan is to meet at Palace Lanes (on Bellaire) from 3:00 to 5:30 PM
tomorrow..... I realize that this is a little early for some of you.....
but... deal with it... what..... you can't start beveraging a little earlier
??????

Then... the group, I think, will be moving to Little Woodrows.... also on
Bellaire....... until who knows when.  If you would like to attend......
assume your happy ass is invited........:-)

Attendees currently includes DETM..... TEMI..... Enron....... hopefully some
of the EPMC people... and whomever else we can get involved..... call the guys
from KOCH......... invite everyone......... ask questions if you got em.......
talk to you soon..... Richard

P.S.  Just a little side note...... for some reason... probably old age... I
will be going under the scope.... for my knee.... this Thursday..... sucks for
me...... but I'm hopeful that this will allow me to walk more like a normal
person again......... so the jogging starts again sometime next week..... that
is all.... LATE
