All,

Following up on my memo of last week, here is the ISO's latest description
of the circuit breaker concept, written by David Patton.  This will be
discussed tomorrow at the task force meeting, which I will attend.

Subject: Circuit breaker memo



CB Working Group,

Attached is the memo that was requested during last week's conference call.
As an aside, we still need to come up with a new and more accurate name for
this.
Please contact me if you have any questions, otherwise I will speak with you
all on Tuesday.

Regards,

David
