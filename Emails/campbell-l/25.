The oil and gas production (O&G) and transmission and storage (T&S) MACT 
rules have been signed by EPA and should appear in the Federal Register very 
soon (late May or early June). You will have three years to comply for 
existing sources, but new sources must comply with these regulations as soon 
as the rules appear in the Federal Register. New sources, as defined in the 
regulations, are any dehys that were installed on or after February 6, 1998. 
I will be putting out an Environmental Notice about these rules, but if you 
have a dehy that was installed on or after February 6, 1998, contact me and 
we can discuss how to get that unit into compliance immediately. In addition 
to control requirements, you will have 120 days to notify EPA about any new 
sources.
