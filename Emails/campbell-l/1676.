As part of the 2002 Business Planning process for the NYISO, the Budget,
Standards, and Performance Subcommittee (BS&P) has prepared the attached draft
corporate goals for 2002 using the 2001 goals as a starting point.

As noted in the attached draft, some of the metrics on certain goals for 2002
have been modified and certain goals have been added or deleted.  The BS&P is
requesting input on this draft from all Market Participants.  You can e-mail
your comments to me at amatim@nimo.com.  We need your comments by May 15 in
order to finalize this draft as input to the internal NYISO Business Planning
process which starts June 1.

If you have questions or comments you wish to discuss, you can call me on
315-460-2550.
