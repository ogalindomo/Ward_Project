Hi all, Merry Christmas.? I've had several  requests for the SHS email list.? 
I'm not really very good at this computer  stuff.? The only way I could 
figure out how to send?the addresses to  all that have requested them is to 
send this little message?with?the  addresses attached.? I'm sure there is a 
more "techie" and acceptable way  but...I am blonde now you know.? Once 
again, Merry Christmas, Happy New  Year and most of all, God bless you richly 
with wonderful friends, family and  His peace.? Love to you all...Diane
