Subject: "Megafill"

I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. Terraso.

The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being 
abandoned in place.  He will send me some promotional information.  

Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at  
http://www.roartech.com/megafill/ claiming that:

Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day.

 The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity
 (in most cases 100%).

Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA).

Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines.

No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines.

Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water
created by the rinsing method of abandonment.

No waiting for test results.

No cost for analytical.

GPS equipped trucks.

He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42" diameter.
