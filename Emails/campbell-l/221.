Bill, as one of your last acts of kindness towards me before I receive your 
extremely generous Christmas gift in the mail, would you please approve of 
the attached expense report.

If I dont see or talk to you this month, may you and your  family be richly 
blessed at the celebration of the birth of  our Savour.
