Sorry about that.

Those who know me, know that the missing zero in my previous email was
probably a Freudian "wishful thinking" slip. FERC of course approved the
continuation of the existing $1000 (not $100) bid cap.

A question for the ISO and Penalty/Disclosure proponents: given the
close linkage between the AMP and the Penalties proposal now being
appealed to the Board, is the MC going to have to revisit the Penalties
motion as well? If so, will the two proposals stay separate or go up to
the MC and Board as a package?
