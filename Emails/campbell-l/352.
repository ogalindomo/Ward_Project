Rich, I agree with  your concern.  The entire Arizona mainline is a potential 
concern for carrying PCB's into California.  We have verification of this 
from the last cleaning we did on the San Juan lateral where liquids got past 
the Gallup C/S scrubbers and PG&E and SoCal both reported elevated liquids in 
their systems. Analytical results of these liquids in California showed PCB's 
at regulated levels (ie greater than 50 ppm).

Gary we won't be able to do any of this cleaning until we get sufficient 
scrubbers at these locations. One thing we can't afford to do this time is 
take a chance of moving any PCB'S further West. There are new scrubbers 
planned for the West locations in the future.
Thanks

Subject: DR/Pipe Cleaning on TW Mainline

Ben, 

Ken and I have looked over my tuned TW West mainline model and feel the next 
area we should target for aggressive cleaning and/or drag reducer is between 
stations 2 & 3.  This section is sufficiently far away from California that 
PCB issues should be mitigated.  It has the highest relative roughness 
(excluding Gallup to Station 4, which appears to be mostly SCADA calibration 
errors).  Station 3 has more HP than the other stations and therefore more 
likely to achieve MAOP.  The higher HP and reduced pipeline losses will 
translate to a significantly higher pressure at the discharge of station 2.

By my estimation, we will gain 5 MMBTU/D in total system capacity if we 
reduce the effective roughness of this one section from 0.00077 to 0.00058.
