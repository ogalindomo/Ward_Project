Dear Market Participants:

There will be a short disruption to the telephones at the NYISO
due to the conversion to a new telephone system tonight.  The
Customer Relations Helpdesk and critical Operations lines will
be the last ones disconnected and the first ones reconnected.
We anticipate the outage for these lines will be short.

If you cannot get through, please try again in 10 - 15 minutes
or you can send an email to market_relations@nyiso and we will
use one of our back-up cell phones to contact you.

Our apologies for the inconvenience but it is unavoidable as
we switch to the improved telephone system.


Regards,

Customer Relations, NYISO
