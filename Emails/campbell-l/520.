I just received a copy of this letter from Southwest Gas to Lee Stewart, 
President of SoCalGas' transmission business unit.? They are asking for PECO 
750H coalescing filters to be installed at to taps, and for SoCal to maintain 
them.

Are these the same filters that were used by PG&E?? Do you know what they 
cost?? Does Transwestern wish to become involved, or would you prefer to stay 
in the background?
