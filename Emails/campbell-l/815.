Please be advised that the KeySpan Energy Delivery Companies' deadline
for December drops is Wednesday, November 15, 2000 at 1:30PM (NY time)
and the deadline for enrollments is Monday, November 20, 2000 at 1:30PM
(NY time).

The enrollment deadline applies to the INTERRUPTIBLE as well as the FIRM
accounts for Long Island.  This change is necessary to be able to
populate the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) with the correct data.

We strongly recommend that you process your transactions as well in
advance of these deadlines as possible. Key Span will not accept any
transaction beyond these dates and times. Transactions that are rejected
and resubmitted subsequent to the deadline dates and times will not be
accepted.

Your cooperation in compiling with this request is greatly appreciated

Thank You,


KeySpan Energy Delivery
