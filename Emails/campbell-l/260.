     Here is the crane team list, I have found an EOTT tank and pressure
vessel Inservice Inspection reports, The bottom of report has EOTT-23, and
a 195-432 number on it. I have also found a folder with Texas title V air
permits on it and it has the tank information that shows tanks grand
fathered. This says General operating permit application for the Equilon
pipeline company LLC Crane station TNRCC ACCOUNT NO. CY-0016-N Crane county
texas, dated October 1998. If you need these sent to you i can make copies
of all the pages and mail them to you. There is about 40 pages in file.
Let me know if i can be of any other help.  Duane Konen.
