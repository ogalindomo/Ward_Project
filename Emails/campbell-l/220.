Attached is the approved invoice management procedure for REMEDIATION 
projects associated with EPSC operations (EOTT assets).  The procedure was 
developed to streamline the insurance recovery process.  If you have any 
questions please give me a call.  Also, please forward this to any 
individuals that may need access to the procedure.



Thanks, Bill
