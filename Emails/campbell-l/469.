Shudeish,
Per your request, Argent has prepared revised netting calculations for the
Transwestern Pipeline Company Kingman and Flagstaff Compressor Stations. The
revised calculations are based on the year 1999 and 2000 data submitted to
the ADEQ on the emissions inventories. Attached are the calculations. If you
have any further questions, please call me at the number below.
