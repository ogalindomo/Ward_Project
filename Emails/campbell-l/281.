We have received the water well survey for the N. Crawar site. The Crane 
County Water District owns 11 water wells within a one mile radius of the 
site. The nearest well is located about 1000 feet east of the site. It 
appears that all of the wells are completed into the uppermost aquifer and, 
in general, are screened from 50' bgs to total depth at about 140' bgs. The 
shallow water table at the site and in the nearby wells is at about 50' bgs. 
The groundwater flow direction at the site has consistently been toward due 
south. There are no water supply wells within one mile due south of the site. 
There are two monitor wells at the east side of the site which have always 
produced clean samples. The remediation system for this site should be 
operational by April 1, 2001. We will also have more current groundwater 
sampling information for the site within the next few weeks.
