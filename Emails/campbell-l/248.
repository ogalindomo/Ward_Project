Attached are the EHS objectives submitted to Phil Lowry and Mike Terraso.  
Please make every effort to support the objectives identified in this 
document.  Implementation of these items will allow for the continued  growth 
of ETS's commitment to the EHS function.

Due to recent developments, I will not be traveling  this week or next.

Thanks, Bill
