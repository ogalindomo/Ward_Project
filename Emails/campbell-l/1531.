Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on May, 01, 2001.
:

*  The software required to implement the Automated Mitigation
Process (AMP) will be deployed to the MIS and SPIDER systems. The
Automated Mitigation Process is the automation of existing market
mitigation procedures for the proactive mitigation of energy
suppliers who are about to exercise market power with a subsequent
price impact.  Activation of the software is pending.

*  A new version of the Moving Range Chart web application will be
deployed (Originally scheduled April 24th , 2001).

*  The process to generate all the files posted for real-time LBMP
data to the NYISO web site (OASIS) will be changed to use XML
technology in order create the files faster, neater and more
reliably. The files Market Participants use in the OASIS will not
change.  Previously a product called InfoReports was used to
generate those web postings.

Changes #: KKIR-4VQSTF; RMUY-4VPRUZ; VLEE-4VQPHQ; MDSO-4VPSM6

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate
with us about these changes.

Thank you,
