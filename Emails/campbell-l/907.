Hi Larry,

Since it's been a month since we emailed you our list of recommendations, we 
wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help 
you with your diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an 
informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, 
since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants 
who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

P.S.
If you have already purchased, please let us know in a reply to this message 
so we will know not to send any more follow up messages.
