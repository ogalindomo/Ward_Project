Larry:

Ruth indicated you are having problems with EPA Region 6. Attached is a file 
with two EPA letters 
that include the statements:

     "granted a waiver
     from the fuel nitrogen monitoring requirement as natural
     gas fuel has been determined to contain no fuel bound
     nitrogen and having free nitrogen which does not contribute
     appreciably to the formation of NOx emissions"

and


 "EPA has already determined that nitrogen monitoring
     can be waived for pipeline-quality natural gas since there
     is no fuel bound nitrogen and the free nitrogen does not
     contribute appreciably to NOx emissions."


I also have an EPA contact in Research Triangle Park that is quite familiar 
with turbine NSPS regs.

Give me a call if you need more help.

Marc
