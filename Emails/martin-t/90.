Eric,
Tom asked me to send you this schedule.  It is something I put together based 
on information from EOL
based on average number of trades per day by month.  I did it to arrive at an 
approximate number of EOL
trades for the year for the EAST and WEST regions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Edie
