I am working on a Ski trip proposal for HPLC & ENA and would like for 
everyone to think 
about possible customers.    If the trip is approved, the trip will probably 
occur on 
  1.   Wednesday, Feb 28 - Saturday March 3rd
   or
  2.  Wednesday March 7th - Saturday, March 11th

Please let me know the number of customers each of you feel confident will 
attend.  I am expecting to
be able to accommodate up to a total of 18-20 people (2 houses), including 
Enron folks. I can commit to at least  5 and
up to 10 customers, if we happen to need that many. 

Possible Enron Reps   
 1.  Tom Martin
 2.   Lee Papayoti
 3.  Gary Lamphier
 4.  Greg Brazaitis
 5.  Brian Redmond
 6. Laurie Allen
 7. Janet Wallis
 8. James Mc Kay
 9. Have I missed anyone?  

Let me know what your thinking ASAP, I would like to submit this for approval 
on Friday the 15th.

Janet
