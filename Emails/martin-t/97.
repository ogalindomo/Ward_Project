Hi, Julie.  I really appreciate you getting this information for me.  The 
company/cost centers that I need the information for are as follows:

0012/106012
0012/105978
0413/105633
0012/105982
0413/105984
0012/105977

The reason we need this information is because there are some people who are 
Houston Pipe Line employees, and we want to ensure that they have or do not 
have the applications they are required or not required to have.  Tom Martin 
is over the Texas Desk, and he is the person who would like this 
information.  

Thanks again!
