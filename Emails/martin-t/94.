Subject: Electronic Customer Data Provided to AEP

Dave Baumbach is comfortable with the type of customer data that Tommy will 
provide to AEP on Tuesday, February 27th.  We should make sure that Enron has 
no liability for the accuracy of our electronic data (ie. if we have errors 
in our electronic data, it is still their responsibility to know the 
contracts and we are not representing this data to be factual reproductions 
of the actual customer contracts).  Are we taking on any actual or implied 
liability with providing this data?

Tom
