Subject: ECI Accepts Enron's Offer


     Gary,

     I am pleased to accept the offer Mr. Stephen Schneider extended to us
     yesterday during our meeting in Baytown.

     We calculate the damages you offered to reimburse us for to be $27,749

     As we discussed, this is for repairing the actual damage done to the
     plant, and does not include any off spec or lost production issues.

     Please give me a call and we can discuss how you would like to handle
     the conclusion of this matter.

     Thank you for helping solve this issue.

     Best Regards,

     Bobby Combs
