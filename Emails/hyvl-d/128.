Dan, Could you please review the attached proposal to Jacksonville Electric 
Authority.  Enron is buying (for $0) the right to put a long term gas supply 
deal to JEA.  JEA has verbally agreed to the concept.  If they are fine with 
these commercial terms the next step will be to turn in into an executable 
contract.

Thanks for your assistance, - Mike
