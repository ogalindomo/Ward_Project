What a wonderful legal team--thanks to all of you for helping us pull 
together the divergent pieces of this complex structured financing.  John and 
Bob (Thompson & Knight), we appreciate how important your willing 
responsiveness and VPP financing expertise have been in this process.

Happy New Year!
