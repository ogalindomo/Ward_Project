Dan,

Here are Sithe's changes to the documents.  Since the plant was down for 
maintenance until last week, the November agreements will not be executed.  
Please refer to the clean documents.  Also, we need to prepare a separate 
group of documents for first quarter of 2001.  Then we can incorporate your 
language for the end of the quarter true-up payment.

Subject: Draft Transaction Agreements for December




Attached are the 2 draft agreements, each in black-lined as well as clean 
versions.? Most of the changes were for the sake of consistency.? I have also 
cleaned up the true-up for December peak, making a reference into the 
December off-peak document.? Please make sure that you think it works.

Regards, 

Jason
