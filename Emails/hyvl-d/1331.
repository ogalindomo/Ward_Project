Subject: Henry Ford and God




Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford and
tells him, "Well, you've been such a good guy, and your
invention...the assembly line for the automobile...changed the world. As a
reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want."

Ford thinks about it, and says, - "I want to hang out with God Himself."

So the befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him
to God. Ford then asks God, - "When you invented Woman, what were you
thinking?"

God asks, "What do you mean?"
"Well," says Ford, "You have some major design flaws in your invention:
1. There's too much front end protrusion.
2. It chatters way too much at high speeds.
3. Maintenance is extremely high.
4. It constantly needs repainting and refinishing.
5. Every 28 days it leaks fluid and is rendered out of service.
6. The rear end wobbles too much.
7. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust.
8. The headlights are usually too small.
9. Fuel consumption is outrageous.

"Hummmm," replies God, "hold on a minute." God goes over to the
Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the
results. In no time the computer prints out a report, and God reads it.
God then turns to Ford, and says, "It may be that my invention is
flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding my
invention than yours.
