Below I have attached the "Enfolio Master Sale/Purchase Agreement".  Please 
note that Exhibit C (ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT-GUARANTY 
AGREEMENT) is no longer a required document to complete the transaction; 
therefore, please discard.

Please print and execute two copies of the Enfolio Agreement along with the 
two Transaction Agreements which should arrive via Federal Express later 
today.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Chris
