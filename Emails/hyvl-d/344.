Here are revised draft transaction agreements for September and October.  I 
believe
that we have revised all the small volume changes that are indicated on the

that I just sent out.

Also, attached is a revised set of GSA procedures that incorporate Marty's 
quick comments
on Bullet Point #5 under the GSA Daily Nomination section.
