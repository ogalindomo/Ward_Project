Dan--

Please check the attachments; I believe you may have inadvertently attached 
Petrogulf redlines instead of Yates...Thanks!

Subject: Yates agreements attached

Dan,
 Please review the attached and call me if you feel that we should 
incorporate some of the other items which Yates requested in the next draft.  
I have enclosed a red-lined version showing changes and a clean copy of each 
agreement.
