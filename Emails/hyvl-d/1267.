ALL I NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED FROM THE EASTER BUNNY

...Don't put all your eggs in one basket
...Walk softly and carry a big carrot
...Everyone needs a friend who is all ears
...There's no such thing as too much candy
...All work and no play can make you a basket case
...A cute little tail attracts a lot of attention
...Everyone is entitled to a bad hare day
...Let happy thoughts multiply like rabbits
...Some body parts should be floppy
...Keep your paws off other people's jelly beans
...Good things come in small sugarcoated packages
...The grass is always greener in someone else's basket
...An Easter bonnet can tame even the wildest hare
...To show your true colors you have to come out of your shell
...The best things in life are still sweet and gooey
