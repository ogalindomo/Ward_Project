Carl - attached below is a red lined version of the Transaction Agreement. 

Please note our treatment of the increased DCQ.  Essentially, we simplified 
the language by placing it under DAILY CONTRACT QUANTITY.   Placing the 
language here makes the volume increase part of the defined term DCQ. 
Therefore any reference to DCQ, including pricing, will apply to the 
increased volumes.   

Let me know if this is acceptable.  I will thereafter forward originals for 
signature.

thanks
