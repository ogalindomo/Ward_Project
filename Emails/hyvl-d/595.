Dan, 

I think this is the last version we were working on.  You might double check.

Subject: Southern Confirmation Letters

Attached please find a red-line redraft of the Confirmation Letters.  I 
understand that Enron will not sign the confirmation letters with Southern 
until Enron North America Corp. has finalized its arrangements with the Elba 
Island Terminal entity having the gas available at the tailgate of the Elba 
Island facility.  Is this correct.  If so, I do not need to make ENA's 
contract with such entity a condition precedent to the Southern Confirmation 
Letters.  Please advise.
