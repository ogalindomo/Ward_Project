Subject: Master Agreements for Canadian Counterparties

In a meeting with legal today, Geoff Storey indicated that the following 
counterparties should be the next counterparties we should focus on getting 
master agreements in place:

1)  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Canada,
2)  TransAlta  Enterprises Corporation,
3)  Blackhills Energy Canada,
4)  Blackhills Energy US,
5)  PanCanadian Petroleum Limited,  and
6)  El Paso Canada.

Bob, please let me know if there are any major counterparties that should be 
added to this list.  Brant, please provide me with credit worksheets on these 
counterparties as soon as possible.    

Thank you for your help.
