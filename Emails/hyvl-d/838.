Susan,
???? I have reviewed the  contract form that you provided in November and
have attempted to make the  changes which would be required for Enron to
utilize the form.? I  believe that the red line document attached? should
address a majority  of the issues which? need to be changed.? Please review
and give  me you comments as to the suggested changes.
