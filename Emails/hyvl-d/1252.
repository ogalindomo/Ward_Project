Subject:  Enron Parking Receipt for January 2000  

Who do I need to contact to get a copy of the parking receipt for January 
2000?  The Aon Consulting statement indicates that I did not do a 
reimbursement request for that month.  Can you direct me to the person who 
could get me a copy of the January 2000 receipt.  Thank you.
