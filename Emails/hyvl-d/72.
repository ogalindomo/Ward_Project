Attached is the bullit sheet for AEC as well as a revised deal diagram.  
Please reference as you prepare the Letter Agreement.   We need to send the 
initial draft to AEC by noon Monday.

Again, I appreciate your hard work on this matter.  Please call David or 
myself on this matter.  If you need me over the weekend, my pager is 
1-800-910-1804.

Thanks

Oscar
