Dan,

Here is the latest Westport contract with a few changes I need you to take a 
look at.
Also, in Section 8, what are payment securities? They would like this to be 
defined.
They also would like Section 9 to be bi-lateral.

One other question Westport has is - If the delivery point (screw compressor 
meter) is off the acreage lease, can all the fees be charged back to the 
royalty owners?
I told them you may not want to give an opinion on this and they are alright 
with that.

Let me know your thoughts on all the above.

Mike
