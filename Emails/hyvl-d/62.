Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle
