The L/C draw was wired in for the full amount of $540,170.00 and will be 
applied to the A/R account of Cage.

At the same time I will have a termination dollar amount from structuring 
tomorrow by 10:30 and will forward it to you at that time.
We can then send Cage a letter for damages owed.

Thanks

Russell
