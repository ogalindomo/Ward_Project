Here is the first shot at a time table for Phase II from MLV 812 to Lomax.
The same time table from Phase I was used.  2 days between the phases was
allowed & 1 day for a pipeline repair.  This time table seems to be early
but we need to notify our customers of the dates of this maintenance as soon
as possible.  They need to find alternate sources of gas or plan maintenance
around these dates.  Please review & notify me of any discrepancies that you
find.
