Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle
