Dan, I was just checking to see if there was an update on Murphy Gas 
Gathering - they have applied for EOL and are still hanging out.  If it 
appears that this is going to be a long-term process, please let me know and 
perhaps we'll close them out for now until we get the acceptable language 
worked out.  

Also, I've responded back to Gibson Petroleum re: their confidentiality 
agreement.  I'll keep you posted as to what they come back with.  Thanks for 
your help.

Walter
