Dan,

Attached is my attempt at rewriting the Kaiser Agency Agreement that I sent 
you last.  Please have a look at it and let me what additional changes are 
needed.
The basic concept of the deal is simple:

Enron sells Kaiser Gas at index price
Enron agrees to provide market and pricing information
Kaiser designates Enron as agent to manage its pipeline capacity
Kaiser can purchase incremental quantities of gas pursuant to the Enfolio 
agreement
Kaiser can sell back unwanted quantities of gas pursuant to the Enfolio 
agreement

Please let me know how quickly we can turn this around, I'd like to get him 
something this week.

Sincerely,

David Fuller
