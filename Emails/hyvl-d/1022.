Gary,

There are three changes:

1)  When you converted the former CONTRACT PRICE #3 to a MinDQ cash out 
clause, the idea of cashing out the DCQ was lost.  I copied the clause from a 
previous version and added a debit or credit sentence.

2)  I put in a point 4 under Contract Price to capture the idea that if 
Westvaco was going to have a Shutdown during the month, we could call you and 
you could get out of you position with the advanced warning, therefore we 
could avoid the cashout.

3)  Finally at the end of the Contract Price section, I put language to 
incorporate the idea that fixed pricing would be included in the DCQ.

Please call and we can discuss.

Thanks,
Michael

Sentence has been changed. Fixing a price added.  Unfortunately MINDQ
stays.
