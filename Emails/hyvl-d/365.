With respect to the Daily Contract Quantity: MaxDQ on the PERC Transaction 
Agreement, should 'scheduled' in "scheduled by Buyer" be capitalized in 
relation to the followin definition in the Master Agreement.  I don't know 
the answer, but thought it may be relevant.  This definition does not seem to 
be the same as what scheduled in the Transaction Agreement is used for.  I am 
wondering if requested might be a better term for this use.

Let me know what you think.

"Scheduling" or "Schedule," when used in reference to Seller, means to make 
Gas available, or cause Gas to be made available, at the Delivery Point(s) 
for delivery to or for the account of Buyer, including making all Pipeline 
nominations, and when used in reference to Buyer, means to cause Buyer's 
Transporter to make available at the Delivery Point(s) transportation 
capacity sufficient to permit Buyer's Transporter to receive on a firm basis 
the quantities Seller has available at such Delivery Point(s), including 
making all Pipeline nominations.  Gas shall be deemed to have been Scheduled 
when confirmed by Transporter.
