Dan--

After meeting with Quantum, I have attached some suggested revisions to the 
documents for your review.  We (me & Quantum) still have a couple commercial 
issues to discuss so this will not be the last turn...but we're close.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Dan




P.S.  Thanks for your quick turnaround on Westport; I was very involved in 
the deal and know that our quick action was important to securing the 
dedication...[and its Mike's first deal up in Denver!
