Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there 
are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to 
nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes 
priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months 
what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any 
further questions let me know.

Thanks,

Tom
