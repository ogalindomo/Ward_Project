Great to hear the tests show Mom's "holding"...as well as Allison's tests...
Now on to the birthday..Dan are you still doing the brisket? What do you'all
want to go with it? Do we want to bake a cake? or buy one? (I vote for a
small baked one..and will do it, if you'all want). Are we doing brisket
sandwiches or sliced brisket with "fixin's"? That will determine what kind
of "fixin's" we need..Let me know..
Love ya,
Bettye
