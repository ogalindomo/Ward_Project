No, it does not amend an existing deal...
For some reason I thought this was a special counterparty!

Jennifer,
 I assisted the trader in documenting a deal that was a retrade of an earlier 
deal.  There is no reason that you can't prepare the confirm for the current 
trade.  Does it modify the existing deal in any manner?  If so, we may need 
to amend the existing deal.  Please advise.

I have a physical forward with the City of Pasedena, traded 09/18/00.  There 
is a master in place, however, I thought you confirmed this counterparty.

Please let me know
Thanks
Jennifer
