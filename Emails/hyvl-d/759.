When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

thanks
