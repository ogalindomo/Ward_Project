I am trying to get a contract together for a wellhead purchase from 
Hydrocarbon Lease Mgmt .  I will be buying the gas (in the name of ENA??) and 
selling into NGPL.  Can we do a form contract, 1 year?  What type do you 
typically use, GISB?  Please let me know when I can visit with you today on 
this.  Thanks,  MJJ
