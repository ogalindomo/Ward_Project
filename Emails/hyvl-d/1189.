Attached is a worksheet for a new Master Firm Purchase/Sale for Modesto 
Irrigation District.  We need to send them a draft ASAP.  Kim Ward has a deal 
pending with them, and we need to get this executed prior to closing the deal.

Please send a draft OVERNIGHT to:

Mr. Scott Van Buren
Modesto Irrigation District

Modesto, CA 95354-0701
Phone (209) 526-7373


Thanks and sorry for the rush.
