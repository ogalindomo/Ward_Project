Good morning. We repeated the MMSE test this week. Mom did  much better this 
time. Still has trouble with short term memory, but she drew  the clock 
correct this time. It looks like the medicine is holding things okay.  The 
doctor talked with her briefly about banking needs and finances, so she  
shouldn't be surprised if we bring up the subject.? She (the doctor) told  
her that her concern was of someone taking advantage of her,(strangers, 
etc.)  since she may not remember that she had already paid for something and 
try to do  it again.
?Still planning to get together Sat. June 2. Mom thinks  she is going out for 
her birthday so I don't expect her to try to cook alot of  stuff. Let me know 
what is needed as far as food.
?Oh, Allison's tests also were better. The urinary reflux  that was seen 6 
months ago appears to have corrected itself. No surgery needed,  however they 
are still concerned about why she has had the frequent urinary  tract 
infections. Anyway she too is doing much better. Let me hear ffrom both of  
you.
