Would know anything about a physical foward between HPL and Hilcorp Energy 
Company, confirmed by Legal in April-2000?

Unfortunately, there are no comments as to who prepared the confirm.

Let me know
thanks
Jennifer

Do you know who in Legal confirmed the first leg?  I did not.  I think that 
you should go back to the original attorney.

Should you prepare?...
There is a new deal with Hilcorp traded on 08/31...comments say "3month 
GISBE" and the 1st leg was confirmed through legal.
I do not have a deal ticket...the deal # is NE0469.2.
Patrick Ryder input the deal.
