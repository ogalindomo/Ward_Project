Attacked are comments received this morning from Reynolds Metals on a 
combined transportation/sale transaction that they have been working relative 
to Reynolds Gregory plant.   Reynold's comments to the Form of Enfolio Master 
that we sent them in early October, 1999 (see hpl.doc file below) are 
extensive and I'm going to need your help sorting out which ones we can work 
with and which ones are non-negotiable.  I'll be able to take care of the 
Transportation comments.  I'll let you know when Greg and Lee are ready to 
meet on this matter.

Steve,
We have just received these from Reynolds and Lee and I need to study them.  
Would you kindly take a look and we can discuss in the near future.

After you have had time to review thgese, lets setup a time to discuss.
Ihave attached our gas specs that HPL needs to meet.
Comments on Enfolio are in hpl.doc and comments of hpl.doc is the comments
on transportation agreement.  Not these are comments, many legal questions
asked, but need to discuss the "business deal more"!
