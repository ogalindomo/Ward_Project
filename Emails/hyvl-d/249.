		 Subject: Cage -Termination Amount

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell
