Dan:  I have sent your modifications to Dave Anderson (Law) for review.

I will need to prepare two separate Enron agreements for final execution,
once we agree on terms. 1) Enron North America and 2) Enron Canada Corp.
Also, I would like to show the effective date October 1, 1999 on both
agreements, if you concur.

thanks,
Charlotte
