Select Energy is ready to execute this netting agreement.  They are just 
wanting to change the governing law to New York--are you okay with that (so 
that we can have this executed ASAP)???

Vernica-

I just called and left a message for you.

Attached is the netting agreement you sent to me via email with Select
Energy's information.  We have one request for the netting agreement.  We
would like to have the choice of law be New York.  I have made that change.

If this is acceptable to you, we will go ahead and execute the netting
agreement and I can fax it to you today.

Please let me know.

Regards-

Valerie Mooney
