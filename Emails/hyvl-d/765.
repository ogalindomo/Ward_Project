Dynergy have accepted that the contract that they have prepared for Natural 
Gas Liquids is in effect an interruptible contract although it is not 
described as such and that this needs to be re-visited.
 
I will be sending further comments today which will attempt to move the 
contract closer towards what we would like to see in our contracts.
 
Kind regards
 
Marcus
