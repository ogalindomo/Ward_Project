Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Pat Sweeney
Austin Energy
