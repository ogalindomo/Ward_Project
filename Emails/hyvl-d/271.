Here is the spreadsheet that I did for Brenda about 1 1/2 months ago.  I hope 
it helps.

Attached is the information that I believe will help with your project.  This 
spreadsheet is a compilation of reports/deals from Sitara, volumes from 
Unify, research & input from employees in other departments (Ami Chokshi, 
Daren Farmer, etc.)

The spreadsheet has 2 tabs.  The first has the "Contractual Volumes", except 
for a new contract that can't be located & one that doesn't reference any 
volumes.  The second tab has the "Actual Volumes" obtained from Sales 
Invoices in Unify.

If you need anything else or any clarification, please let me know.
