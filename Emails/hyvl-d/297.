Wes - I spoke with Barbara Gray in Legal last night.  Unless Entex consents, 
the Entex contract can only be assigned to an Enron affiliate.  However, 
Barbara thinks we can assign this contract (plus any other on-system ENA 
sales contracts) to an Enron affiliate, then sell this affiliate along with 
HPL stock to the buyer.  Barbara or Dan, if there are major impediments to 
this strategy, please let me know.

Patrick
