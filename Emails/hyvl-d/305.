Dan,
I need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with Intercontinental 
Terminals Company.
This company is located at 1943 Battleground Road, P.O. Box 698, Deer Park 
Texas 77536-0698.
My contact is Lynn Bingham (281) 884-0312. They have showed interest in doing 
a  fixed rate. That 
is why I would like for them to sign a Master contract at this time. That way 
when we agree on a price
we can act on it without having to wait on getting them approved. They passed 
along to me that they
are a sister company of Global Octane. Call me with any questions.
