Good Morning - As you're aware, we will be producing a  souvenir booklet on 
HPL for the anniversary party and I want to include another  entry under 2000 
that indicates the start of a new era since HPL has a data room  open.? I 
would appreciate your thoughts on how to word that.? Thanks,  Elaine
