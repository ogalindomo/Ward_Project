We are going to use our contract for the 3 month deal, so what you have given 
me is fine for that.  For the longer term deal, they want to start with their 
contract.  So, please review it over the next few weeks to be ready for their 
next deal starting Feb 1.


Thanks

Chris

Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price?
