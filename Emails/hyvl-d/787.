Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - "subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements."

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Thanks,

Kim
