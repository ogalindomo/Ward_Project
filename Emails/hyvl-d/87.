Dan,

 The two deals mentioned below are deal #s 97154 & 97077 under contract 
96022216.  Entex has already paid this invoice in full.  Let me know if there 
is anything needed on my end to get these deals corrected, if needed.

Thanks,
Kyle

Kyle,
 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle
