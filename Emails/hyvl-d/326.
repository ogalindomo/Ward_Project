Dan,

Please see V&E's September 1 mark up of the FSA Consent.  The first time I 
sent you this document, you asked me to resend because it was corrupt.  I'm 
concerned that when I resent, I may have sent you an earlier version of it, 
based on some of your comments.  Mark Spivak (V&E) and I will call you this 
afternoon regarding this consent and your comments.

Thanks,
Diana Parker
