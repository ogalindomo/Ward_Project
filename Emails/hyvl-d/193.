Dan--

I reviewed the latest Quantum docs (on my machine) and I had only two 
revisions.

1)  In the purchase agreement, look at my note re: the definition of 
"Gathering Services" (its related to the following revision #2).

2)  In the gathering agreement, I adjusted the allocation between the 
compression portion of the total services rate and the gathering portion of 
the rate per Quantum's request.  I'm sorry the redlining of my revision did 
not happen, but I feel its correct.

Talk with you this afternoon.

Thanks.
