 
can you 3 please call each other and discuss the term or whatever the other 
outstanding issues are, so that we can send this reimbursement letter out.  i 
am literally in meetings all day long, so, i cannot and do not have the time 
to go back and forth between you guys to clear up the outstanding issues.

charlie - jay is still calling asking for the tailgate btu factor.  who can i 
call to get this information.  he needs it in order to pay royalties next 
monday.

thanks
joan
