Here is the latest version of AEC.  Please note the major changes in 
Paragraph 2.  Dan, please make sure the changes I have made are written in an 
acceptable legal format.

Also, I have made Paragraph 4 bi-lateral.

let me know your comments ASAP as I need to get this to AEC early Wednesday 
morning.

Also, we will need to incorporate the appropriate changes into the ECT/Citrus 
Agreement.
