Mr. Hyvl,

How the heck are you ???
Thanks for the quick turnaround on the Westport contracts.
I am hoping Bierbach will sign them this week and I will get one of the 
originals back to you ASAP and get the other original to Westport.


I need a draft copy of the latest gathering agreement and purchase agreement 
so that True Oil Company can start to review them.
We do not have a deal done with them YET but they would like to start 
reviewing the contracts.

Let me know if this is a problem!

Mike
