My supervisor reviewed the agreement and found one error.  In Section 8.8
Confidentiality on page 5, could you add the word "transfer" after the word
"wire"?  Thanks! I promise this is the last change.

"The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any Transaction
and wire TRANSFER instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

Christian,
     I have included the Red-line language in the contract relating to
utilization of small business concerns.  Hopefully, the next thing I see is
2 originals which have been signed by CPS.
