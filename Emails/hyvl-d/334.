The red lettering is what Sithe is suggesting as the formulas for the October 
transaction
agreements.  I believe that you get the same answer as what we had 
suggested.  If you
get the same answer as I did, let's just go with how they have it written.

We will also have to add the other boiler plate language changes that we sent 
to them for
the September transaction agreement.
