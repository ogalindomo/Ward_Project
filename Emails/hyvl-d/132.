Dan,

Westport Oil and Gas Company Inc has agreed to terms for Enron providing 
gathering from the inlet of screw compression to Glenrock.
I am faxing to you a term sheet so that we can get Westport a gathering 
agreement asap. You can use the latest Quantum agreement as a start.
We are NOT purchasing the gas.

Call me with questions,
Mike
