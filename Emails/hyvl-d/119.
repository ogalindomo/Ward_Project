Dan:

Attached is the notice letter we discussed.  I believe it is intended to 
support our position (which is the correct one) that the monies which SECLP 
expects to realize shortly should be paid to cover past due fuel invoices 
rather than replenish the debt reserve account.

I shall appreciate your providing me with your comments, modifications.

 By copy of this e-mail, I'm asking Margaret Doucette, my assistant,  to 
clean up the formatting and complete the addresses, etc. 
 
Thanks for your help.

Carlos
