Based on the 11/6/2000 Enron North America Corp. Deal Listing for all deals 
with flow dates between 4/1/2000 and 11/30/2000 for the three (3) HPLC Desks 
(ENA - IM Texas, HPLC - IM HPLC and HPLC - IM Wellhead), we have determined 
that there are 80 contracts which are currently held by Enron North America 
Corp. which should be reviewed for inclusion in the proposed Triple Lutz 
transaction.  Those contracts are listed on the attachment.
