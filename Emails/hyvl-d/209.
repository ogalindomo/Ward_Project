Attached please find the presentations made by Bryan Begley and Shelley 
Corman during the 2000 Enron Law Conference last week in San Antonio.  Also, 
just a reminder to complete the evaluation forms found in your Law Conference 
notebooks and send them to me in EB4804C.  (If anyone needs a notebook, I 
have extras).  If you have any questions regarding CLE credit or forgot to 
fill in the CLE sign-up sheets at the conference, please contact Brenda 
McAfee.
