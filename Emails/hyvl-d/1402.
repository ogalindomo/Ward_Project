Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we 
discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and 
removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more 
than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you 
need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of 
showing changes.
