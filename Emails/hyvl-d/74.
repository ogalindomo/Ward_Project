Dan -- It sounds okay, but I would expect them to question the need for this 
provision.  Of course, the first reason is that the deal needs to get done.  
The second is the reg-out that FP&L wants.  Is it a fair representation that 
our language is the same as FP&L's?  I know the language is not identical, 
but I want to say our language is a very short version of what FP&L has 
drafted.  Is this okay?

Also, the traders want to be sure that the $0.50/MMBtu LD's are also 
incorporated.  You may have heard this request already, so disregard mine if 
duplicate?

Thanks -- David
