Please see the attached which (I think) describes the improvements in Section 
16 of the Quantum deal.

In my (non-legal) opinion, if we include this document with the scematic of 
the collection facilities in Exhibit B or C of the Purchase/Gath documents, 
then will this suffice for Exhibit B of the Mortgage Agreement?

Thanks.

Dan
