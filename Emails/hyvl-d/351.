Dan, I don't want to be a pest, but as I hope you have been made aware, this 
deal is suppose to be completed by quarter end, which means Friday.  I 
understand fire drills and putting out the hottest flames, but I am thinking 
this one is getting pretty warm because we need to start reviewing any 
documents in order to have them finalized for signature and booking no later 
than Friday afternoon.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to 
help facilitate at least a first draft by this morning.

Thanks,

Steve
