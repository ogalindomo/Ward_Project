Amendment








Charlotte,
     Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article
12.7 was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I
am attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added
the Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index
was not specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me
have your comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and
forward 2 to me for signature by ENA.
