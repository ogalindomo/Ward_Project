Dan,

Need to prepare a contract for Rhodia.  

Term: September 01, 2000 for three years
Price: IF-HSC +.08
Address: Rhodia Inc.
  259 Prospect Plains Road
  CN 7500
  Cranberry, NJ  08512-7500

Attention: John Rhodes  (609) 860-3284
     (609) 860-8562 fax
     john.rhodes@us.rhodia.com

Agent: Summit Energy
 Susan Spalding (502) 429-3800
 sspalding@summitenergy.com

Flexible pricing, change force majeure to longer than 60 days, define firm 
gas, no minimum volume on triggering; were there concerns.
I want to e-mail one to Susan, get it approved and then prepare written 
documentation.

Thanks,

Gary
