Dan,

Delete the other e-mail I sent and use this one.

This is the latest and greatest. I changed Gatherer to Provider and Gathering 
Service to Field Services.

I deleted the last sentence in Section 5 - Pressures.  Let me know if this is 
a problem. This line was added to other agreements at the request of those 
parties.




Hope you had a GREAT weekend.

Mike
