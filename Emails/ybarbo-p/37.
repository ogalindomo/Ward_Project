Capt. Kvammen,

Thank you for the details on the bunkering.
Please note that Todd Peterson has resigned from Enron.  Mr Paul Y'Barbo has 
assumed Todd's responsibilities.  Paul's e-mail address is in the list of 
recipients of this message (above).
Please also copy Mr. Jim Fernie on messages to Enron relating to the Hoegh 
Galleon.  Jim's address is listed above.

Further to our phone conversation of earlier this morning, I will await your 
e-mail updates on the progress of the "Hoegh Galleon"
before finalizing my travel arrangements to Muscat.  My current plans are to 
arrive on Muscat the evening of March 19th, and hope to travel to Sur during 
daylight on the 20th to be in place for when the vessel arrives on the 21st.  
If the schedule changes I will adjust my travel plans to suit.

Best regards,

Tony Galt

Subject: LNG/C "HOEGH GALLEON"  - BUNKERING


Dear Todd,

LNG/C "HOEGH GALLEON"  - BUNKERING

Please be adviced that we bunkered in Singapore F.O. 3500 mt and G.O.
80 mt.  Due to the time press we did not bunkered to capasity.
Based on the above the ROB will be on delivery abt.:
F.O.  3800 mt and G.O. 150 mt.

According to my calculation this should be sufficeint to reach for
bunkering at Suez on ballast leg.

But, our plan is to topping up  with F.O. ,abt 1900 mt, before
loading at Qalhat March 21st, if time permit.

Kindly advice.

Best regards


Capt Kjell Kvammen
