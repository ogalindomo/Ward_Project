Do we need to include in the orders that the arrival cargo saturation 
pressure not to exceed  1100mb ? ( whatever is TLNG's max. ). I believe the 
heel decision should wait until a few days before unloading to ensure before 
heel out we are sure we have a load window that will allow the extra time to 
cooldown again and we figure in the full cost to Enron of the cooldown LNG 
that would have to be purchased from OLNG.
