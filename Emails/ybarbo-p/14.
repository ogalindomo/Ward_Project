Item 5 under Significant Plant Modifications Proposed says you are  examining 
design changes required to install a mooring line tension meter and  ship 
approach velocity meter on the dock(???).
?
What is the rationale for why you feel these two items are needed and can  
you tell me how they work and what happens if they measure beyond some set  
point.? What are the set points you want to measure and why??  Thanks.
