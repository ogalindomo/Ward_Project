Dan/Paul:  In regards to the cargo into the Eco terminal on 26 April we have
chartered the LNGC Golar Freeze  Lloyds Number 7361922, for this delivery.  
The
Golar Freeze is 125,000 M3 Moss Rosenberg (Sphercial) design ship built in 
1977,
and operated by Osprey Maritime.  She frequently calls in the U.S. Gulf at 
Lake

I will provide you both with further information in regards to the ESD
