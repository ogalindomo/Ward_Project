Per our conversation today, the invoice for the "Hilli" delivery will be due 
no earlier than May 17,  2001.  If under normal payment terms the invoice 
would be due later than May 17, then the regular due date would prevail.

Thanks for your help,
Dan Masters

Rudy-
I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the 
"Hilli" be extended.  Since the delivery is earlier than Eco needs the 
product,  they would request that the invoice be due on May 17.  Please 
advise if this is agreeable.

Thanks,
Dan Masters
