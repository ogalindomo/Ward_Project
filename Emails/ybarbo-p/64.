Paul,

If your pc is connected to Enron's network, just enter the following address:

http://eitxhou1a12/cms/cms.html

Then click on second item, which is "View the Event Calendar", you will be 
prompt for the id and password. Once id and password are entered, you should 
be able to see the calendar view. You may want to bookmark this, so next time 
you don't have to remember the address.

Hope this will help, and let me know if you still problem.

Thanks!

Jessie,

Jessie,

Please provide me with instructions on how to access these calendars as soon 
as possible. I am currently travelling and will be visiting AD Gas and Oman 
LNG next week. I will be in Dabhol April 1st. I would like to be able to 
access the system by March 24th.

My assistant is Etelvina Guerra in case you need any paperwork.

Thanks,

Paul
