Dear Tony,

You have may already left Houston for Oman.
But, please be adviced that we left Bahrain today, 18th, at 1800lt
for Oman.
We have now tested the steering gear and the result comply with the
SOLAS requirements.

As you may know, we also received the LOC from the USCG yesterday,
17th.

We are expecting to arrive off Qalhat on the 20th abt 2400 and we are
ready to berth any time after that.



See you in Qalhat.

Best regards
