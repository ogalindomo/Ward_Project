Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt of 
invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day or 
two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way the 
contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can net it 
against our next fuel management payment?

Dan:

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after 
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th, 
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment is 
not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.
