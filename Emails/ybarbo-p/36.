Dan:  Please find the lastest 90 day schedule from Atlantic as of March 2, 
2001.
Please ignore the scheduling of the "P" deliveries for now.  This was ALNG's
work and we have not agreed to this designation.

Jane-
Per our phone conversation on Friday, we will plan on receiveing the
"Methane Arctic" with approximately 68,500 M(superscript: 3) about April 2.
This should hold us until the last part of April or first part of May.  We
will put out the official nomination as usual on March 12.

Thanks and regards,

Dan Masters
