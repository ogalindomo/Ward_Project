Todd,

I will remind Hiro to resend the draft COU for our review. He emailed the 
draft in December but we were unable to open the document. With respect to 
the cool down cargo I intend to wait until we have an agreed plan for DPC 
supply before discussing the cargo with OLNG. Our intent is to make sure the 
cool down cargo is a pre-lift of DPC's fixed quantity obligation regardless 
of the contract start date.

Clay,

Any news on the COU and the redacted Kogas implementation procedures? 

Also, what are you telling them about the first cool down cargo that EE&CC  
are requesting for the 1st of Nov 01.
