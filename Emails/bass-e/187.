Hi Folks,

Keeping with the "you know what I know" philosophy here.

Still checking on confirmations but wanted to pass this along to you from
one of our subscribers, Greg Divers.

Greg just sent me this email:

"WSCR 1160AM in Chicago just reported that Bears' WR Marcus Robinson is done
for the year because of a bulging disk in his back."

Thanks Greg.  While this is bad news for those hoping for a Robinson
comeback, at least it gives you a jump in the week for planning how to fill
the void.  More tonight as I hear it.

Joe
