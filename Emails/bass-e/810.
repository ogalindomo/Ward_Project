Matt,

Thanks for the info.  Do you happen to have the data split out between 
physical and financial trades?   

Thanks,

Subject: Texas Region

Eric,

The following is a the breakout for the Texas region (Transactions and 
Notional Volume). The breakout is based on deal location and/or Pub code. You 
should also note that the database from which this information is derived is 
based on a "Snapshot" methodology. Each day it queries relevant databases for 
EOL and Non-EOL deals for the prior day and stores them. It does not requery 
the databases for previous days, it therefore will not reflect killed, 
restructured, renegotiated, or originated trades which are booked on a 
post-dated basis.



If you have any further requests please contact Torrey Moorer or myself.
