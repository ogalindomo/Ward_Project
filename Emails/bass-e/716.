I am trying to organize everybody's turret so that we have all of the Texas 
Desk people on one page.  This will be especially beneficial for when we have 
people out.  The phone guys are going to completely wipe out what you 
curretnly have on Page 6, so if there is anything other than Texas Desk 
employees, let me know so that they don't get deleted.  

I would also like to reserve some space on Page7 for the rollover lines, so 
ditto with Page 7 as with Page 6.

Let's put a deadline of December 1st for this .... that should be enough time 
for you busy people to let me know if there's a problem.  I'd like to have 
this done on December 4th.

Thanks,
Laura
