I have the jersey's at my desk.  Please come by and pick one up from me by  
4:30 pm today (we're moving).     I'm at   2918 B.   From the glass door, go 
left and I'm toward  the end of the horseshoe.

Also, please continue to raise money.     There's a ton of UT alum and you 
can hit up the people you work with.

All the Enron team captains have confirmed that we will be playing come hell 
or high water... so I'll see you there at 9 AM  (bring all the money you've 
collected).
