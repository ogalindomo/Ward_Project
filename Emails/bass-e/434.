As you can probably tell,   Saturday will mostly likely be cold and raining. 

Dress accordingly to stay warm and dry.       I would recommend that you buy 
a cheap plastic poncho, preferrably see-through (at walmart for $2 or less).
Be prepared for whatever the weather has to offer..

Bring your cleats  (no metal cleats) for traction.   If you need cleats,  
Oshman's has good Riddell football shoes for $20 to $35.

Finally, today is the last day to get donations...   so  get  'em..
