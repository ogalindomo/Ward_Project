The world is treating me ok.  It's just that I can't stop losing money.  It 
hasn't been a very good start to my trading life.  What is going on in your 
world?  I hope to make it out to the house sometime soon.

Love, Eric

Hi son: how is the world treating you? Saw that gas prices were down 
significantly yesterday. Hope you maintained your short position. Say hello 
to Shana. Let me hear from you. Love-Dad
