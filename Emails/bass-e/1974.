Hey Mom,

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to Happy 
Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit Toni 
tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than that, 
just trying to get back into the work groove after all of that vacation.  

How are things on the homefront?

L,
E
