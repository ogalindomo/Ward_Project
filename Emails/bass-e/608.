In case you haven't heard, New Orleans Saints RB  Ricky Williams suffered a 
broken ankle today and is expected to miss 6-8 weeks  which for most Fantasy 
GMs means he's done for the year.
?
Chat Morton is the rookie from USC who filled in  for Williams. But he's 
short (5' 8" and light 187#)? and I don't think this  is a situation like 
Denver where the backup RB will step in and perform almost  as well as the 
starter.? 
?
Just wanted to give you a headsup as I know many  leagues have a first come 
first serve policy for distributing free  agents.

More Monday.
