This is Funny!

A man was doing a study of children's senses in a
first-grade class using Lifesaver candies .  He would ask them to
identify the color and then the flavor as they tasted the Lifesaver.
The children began to say,

"Red...cherry"
"Yellow...lemon"
"Green...lime"
"Orange...orange"

Finally, he gave them all honey flavored Lifesavers. The
children sucked on them for a while, but they couldn't decipher the
taste. "Well" he said, "I'll give you a clue.  It's what your
mother would call your father!" One little girl looked up in horror.  She
quickly spit the  Lifesaver out and shouted, "Everybody, spit it out.
They're assholes!"
