And what exactly did we mean by "English major finally coming into use"??

Anyways, it sucks that most all of the UT games out here are on friggin Pay
Per View.  But I think I will have the distinct pleasure of getting to watch
the UT-A&M game in a house full of A&M officers so I hope we do well.

If my leave gets approved and I can find a ticket in, I should/may be in
town from the 23DEC to 1JAN.  I'll know by tue or wed and let ya know.

What's been up with you, how's Enron treatin ya?

Brett
