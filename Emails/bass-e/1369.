Hi guys. We have access to 4 Aeros tickets Friday night. It is a sky box,
food and booze. Ken Hebert's son is putting the deal together. Your Mother
and I are going(Kathy, Kenny said Cheryl was going, You might want to
verify) and will pick up your cost if you are interested. I thought
originally that you could bring your dates, but there are only 4 tickets
available to us. I must let Kenny know today, so let me know ASAP.-Dad
