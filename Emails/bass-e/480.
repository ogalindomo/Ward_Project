I've adopted two children for the Enron Kids Program ..

Cortesia Taylor, Kindergarden
Jameka McCoy, PreK

The total cost for both children combined is guesstimated to be $350.  If all 
of us contribute, that will be only $15 per person.  I'll be taking 
collections this week and next if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Laura
