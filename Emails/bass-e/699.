Hi everyone,

I just wanted to say thanks again for donating to JDF.  The walk was Sunday, 
and the turnout was great!  Last I heard, Enron employees (including 
matching) contributed a total of $468,000!!  I really appreciate your 
generosity--hopefully it will help find a cure for diabetes!

Thanks!!
Allison
