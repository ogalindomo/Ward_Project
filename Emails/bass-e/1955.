We would like to come, but Shanna is not sure whether or not she will be off 
work by then.  If you have someone else you would like to invite go ahead.  
If not, we will try to make it.  

Thanks for the invite and let me know.

-Eric

I think Michael and his girlfriend are going to come as well and we were
thinking about going out somewhere afterwards.  So,  can ya'll come to the
Pappasitos on Kirby and Richmond?
