Eric,

Is the weekly pot divided or is it winner take all?

I would consider a deal for Taylor, but I won't give up George.  He, in my
estimation, will be starting very soon.

Eric,

I will tell you that it will have to be an offer that I can't refuse.  You
are actually going to maybe take the short end of the stick.  I have done
without him for 4 weeks and he is back this coming week and I am looking
forward to having him in the lineup.
