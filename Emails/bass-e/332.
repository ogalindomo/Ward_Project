Hi Eric,
?
Sorry I had to cut our conversation short.? I  have not had a good morning.? 
I started the day off by taking a hard fall  on the driveway and then our 
flight from Phoenix to Houston was cancelled and I  was trying to work that 
out.? 
?
I'm glad you got back safely.? Did you have a  good time?? Did Shanna have a 
nice holiday?? Speaking of Shanna, will  you call me about her Christmas 
present?? I wanted to run something by  you.? 
?
Have a good day.?  LU-M
