Hi Folks,

Once again, we tap Mike McVay, our Meteorologist / Fantasy Football Fanatic
for some insights.  I know many of you have lineup deadlines today.  We'll
try to get one last update from Mike on Saturday.

Thanks Mike!

Joe




SEATTLE @ DENVER:  The latest on the potential for a snow storm in Denver
this weekend does look a little more promising for McCaffrey, Smith and
Frerotte owners.  The cold air and snow may hold off until after gametime.
Winds will be a concern and this forecast could go either way still, but the
trend is toward a Sunday night snow storm (as of Friday morning).  Frerotte
is likely the only "bubble" player listed above, but if you cannot wait
until late Saturday for the last update, I wouldn't be afraid to use him at
this point if he's your best option.

DETROIT @ GREEN BAY:  This one still looks ugly.  Cold, windy and snow is
likely in Green Bay this weekend.  This is not a major snow storm and the
Packers (especially Favre) seem to thrive when it's nasty out.  Packer
players should be "ok", but if you have "bubble" players with Detroit, you
might want to consider another option.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS CITY:  A cold rain is still in store for the
Chiefs/Panthers game at Arrowhead Stadium.  The Chiefs lack of a running
game could translate to turnovers favoring the Panthers.
