alright, no more memos about bw3 sucking w/o suggesting an alternative. 
matt, you won't be there, so your input is worthless
bryan, two rows isn't conducive to big groups, so pick some place else.

From what I hear, you can't get rid of the first pick either.  I guess you 
will be taking Terrell Davis or Brian Griese...How about the Denver Defense 
as a number 1 pick?
