The type of power is key.  There is a huge difference between your basic
Aiwa amplifier in comparison to Harmon Kardon.  If you tell me what kind of
speakers he wants, that would help.  ALso, is he using an Amp or a receiver?

A guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really
likes a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered
amp.
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Thanks
