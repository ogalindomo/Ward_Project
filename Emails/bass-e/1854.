That is fine.  Mom had said that you wanted me to go through Bob Dunn for my 
mortgage.  Can you give more info?

Good morning Son.I have a favor to ask. Next time  you are @ your bank, 
please get $1000 cash, mostly 100's. I will give you a  check for same. Same 
old problem. No local bank account. If this is a problem  let me know. 
Thanks-Dad
