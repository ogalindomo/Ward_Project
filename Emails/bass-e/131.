May I have your attention, please!!

<ahem>

Just wanted everyone to know that Texas was voted #1 by Playboy magazine for
"Colleges with the Best Looking Girls".  As if we needed affirmation of this
fact...

But, now, we have full-fledged proof to show the world where it's at.

I've never been prouder to say, "Hook 'em Horns!!"

This comes from playboy.com

The List:

1.  The University of Texas
2.  Arizona State
3.  UCLA
4.  University of Florida
5.  University of Arizona
6.  Florida State
7.  University of Alabama
8.  University of Colorado
9.  East Carolina
10. University of Georgia
