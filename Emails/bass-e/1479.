  Sorry about the headache.  I hear that slamming your head
against the wall
  is good for getting rid of migraines.  Oh wait that's what I
do at work to
  help me think about something other than losing lots of
money - never mind.

  Thurs is probably best then - if not then maybe next week.

  My weekend was ok.  Sorry if I stopped by at a bad time on
Thursday!  I've
  had a migraine for the last two days, and it still hasn't
gone away, so I'm
  not feeling 100% today.  I won't be able to get together
until after
  Wednesday or so, if that is all right, I have so much going
on in  school
  this week.  Keep in touch and let me know what day is good
for you!
