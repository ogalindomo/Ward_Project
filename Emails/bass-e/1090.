Hi Boys,
?
Your father and I have decided to tell you what  your Christmas present is 
early.? We will provide to each of you roundtrip  airfare, lodging, groceries 
at the condo, car and lift tickets for our ski  trip.? We are not certain 
where we will go but have selected the  dates.? We will leave Houston on 
Sat., 12/09 and return Thursday  12/14.? Now, what we need to know as soon as 
possible, i.e., today, so that  we can book the air.? If you will accept our 
Christmas present, accompany  us at this time and whether we should book 
airfare for 4, 5 or 6.? (I need  to know the ages of the girls.)? The airfare 
costs will be $300-$500.?  If I book it for 4 or 5, the tickets need to be 
paid for within 30  days.
?
Merry Christmas.? Let us hear from  you.
?
Love, Mom and Dad
