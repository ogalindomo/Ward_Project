As you all are probably already aware, I am not the "math-genius" of the 
Texas Desk.  I meant to say that the combined total for both of the kids is 
$250, not $350.  The cost for each of us will, of course, stay the same.

Ooops.

Subject: Enron Kids

I've adopted two children for the Enron Kids Program ..

Cortesia Taylor, Kindergarden
Jameka McCoy, PreK

The total cost for both children combined is guesstimated to be $350.  If all 
of us contribute, that will be only $15 per person.  I'll be taking 
collections this week and next if anyone is interested.

Thanks,
Laura
