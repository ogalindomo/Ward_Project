Hey Dad.  I am looking forward to Vegas.  Hopefully I won't lose too much $.  
I am glad that I was able to add a little more happiness to her life.  Tell 
Aunt Twila and Uncle Gene hi for me and have a good time this weekend.

Love, Eric

Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let 
those tables become too attractive to you. The more  time you spend @ the 
tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk 
from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is 
enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's 
Day. Call us when you get home. Love-Dad
