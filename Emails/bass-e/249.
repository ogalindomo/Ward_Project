Organizing drinks n margaritas on Friday... 
Over at "El Patio"  at 9:00 - the place is renown for killer margaritas 
(after the second or third people have been known to start table dancing and 
other silly things that I know none of you jokes haver ever done).

Please let me know if there are any issues, concerns, second thoughts, 
cancelations, etc 

Take care and hope to see you there!
Gerardo

PS - feel free to bring other friends over
