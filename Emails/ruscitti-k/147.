Hi Everyone,

I know that there is a whole bunch of you on the receiving end of this EMail
and we haven't seen or spoken to some in quite awhile but know this -- we are
thinking of you and your families!!  Our little (big?) Luke turned 4 months
today so I thought I would share some photos with all of you.  Although we 
have
been guilty of not staying in touch, I hope that the attached photos will 
allow
us to somewhat catch up with you.  It is certainly all about Luke on this end
of the line.  He is happy, healthy and so is Mom and Dad.  Here is hoping that
all is well on your end.  We hope to see everyone soon again some day but 
until
then we wish everyone all the best!

Love,

Todd, Rena, and Luke
