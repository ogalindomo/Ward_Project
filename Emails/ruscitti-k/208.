In what appears to be a rather unoriginal move these days, I've resigned from 
Mother Enron in favor of an early stage .com opportunity.  My last day will 
be this Friday, March 31st.

I'm not a fan of long goodbyes, so let me just say 'thank you' to each of 
you, for the part you played in making my two and a half years at Enron both 
memorable and rewarding.  My new employer (HomeWrite.com) is Houston-based, 
so with the glaring exception of Iaia, I hope to see each of you in the not 
so distant future. 

All my best,

Scott
