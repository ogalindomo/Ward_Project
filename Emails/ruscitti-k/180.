Attached please find the nipsco changes for the 20th.  Please note that there 
is a change on the ANR leg from 200 @ ANR/Ft Wayne to 141 @ ANR/Ft Wayne and 
59 @ ANR/Michigan City.   This will balance your Pool B and make you take the 
withdrawal on Pool A.   Otherwise you would be injecting on Pool B and 
withdrawing on Pool A.  


Total Demand:    Nominated  Difference

Pool A  936   859   (77)     
Pool  B  141   141       0

Total  1,077   1,000   (77)

Also, please note that all changes for 4/21 thru 4/24 are due to be nominated 
on 4/20/00 since Nipsco is closed for the holiday on Friday so if you are 
increasing or decreasing volumes over the weekend I need to have those 
numbers no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning.


Thanks,


Cora
