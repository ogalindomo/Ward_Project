Kevin,

How's things?  Been a while since we talked.  Hope your jobs are going well
and your wedding plans are proceeding smoothly.

Did you get my e-mail about running into Mary Eyre in the gym in San Mateo?
Spooky.  I've seen her a couple more times but I haven't spoken to her; I
get in the "properly pumped" zone.  Turns out there are a lot of classmates
on the peninsula - David Park, Frank Knifsend, Mary, and James Regan come to
mind immediately.

No real news here.  We haven't broken anything in the house in a while, so
either we're getting luckier or we're due.  Both jobs are very busy right
now so the weekends are for recuperating.  This weekend, of course, will be
for watching basketball.

Hi to Lisa - let us know how you're doing.

Regards,
