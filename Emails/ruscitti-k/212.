Chris--The attached file contains the daily changes for 3/27 and 3/28 in the
volumes of gas that we need by market area.  The daily changes are relative to
what we requested on a First-of-the month basis, which values appear in Col.
DD.   You can just open this file and print it out to see the magnitude of the
changes by market area or zone.  We'll be calling regarding pricing.
