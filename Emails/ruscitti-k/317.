Hi all,

I am on the move again.  In case anyone has travel plans to the NE or TX,
I'll will be in either NJ or DC from the 4th-24th of March and in Corpus
Christi from the 24th of March through early May.  I'll settle in at Pax
River (SE MD) sometime in late May.  This email account should remain active
throughout or you can reach me at conway77@hotmail.com or on my cell at
850.939.8989.

Hope all is well,

Frank
