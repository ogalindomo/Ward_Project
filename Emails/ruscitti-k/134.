Dude,
Didn't really have a chance to tell you how great it was to see you again. It 
was way too long and we should not wait another three years to get together 
again. I can promise you that Mr. Moller will not be drinking piss the next 
time we are out. I don't have your work number, so why don't you send it to 
me or call me in the office at 973 367-7150. Tell Lisa I send my best and let 
me know the next time you are back in Jersey with some time to kill.
