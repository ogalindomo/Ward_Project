All:

I just wanted to take a minute to bid you farewell.  This will be my last 
week at Enron as I have accepted a job with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and 
will be starting there next Monday.  I enjoyed working with each of you 
during my time at Enron and hope to keep in touch. I am not sure what my 
email will be at Kinder Morgan but you can always reach me at 
Dax_Sanders@yahoo.com.

Take care and stay in touch,

Dax
