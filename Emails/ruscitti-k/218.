Chris and Kevin--The attached file contains our latest daily volume
requirements for 3/20 and the rest of March.   One caveat:  I have included
here the additional 150 dth/day into Piedmont off Transco for 3/21-3/31.
However, we are still waiting on a price quote from Chris for that volume.  If
we end up getting that gas elsewhere, I will send you a revised spreadsheet 
w/o
the additional 150dth/day into Piedmont.
