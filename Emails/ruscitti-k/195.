The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  today and
tomorrow  .    There are three worksheets:  The one labelled with today's date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the citygate delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be
ignored until further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is
archived on P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to
save a duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily citygate volume relative to a prior value.  For the 
current
gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the 
previous
day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 
3/28,
then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

The sheet labelled storage is for tracking our TCO storage injections (paper
injections).
