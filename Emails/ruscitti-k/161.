David,

Could you take a few minutes to review the attached new location EPNG 
NonBondad.  Tori Kuykendall from the west desk has told us she wants the same 
language that SoCal Topock has due to the fact that the EPNG NonBondad 
section of the pipeline has a history of breaking down and being interrupted 
all the time.  

Thank you,

Melba

Existing:
EPNG SoCal Topock
The transaction is for delivery at the Southern California Gas Company -  
Topock interconnect with El Paso Natural Gas.  The volumes scheduled to be 
delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on 
both El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Gas Company pipelines based 
upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these 
constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to 
receive or deliver firm gas.

New:
EPNG Blanco NonBondad
The transaction is for delivery at El Paso San Juan Blanco non-Bondad.  The 
volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal 
operational constraints on El Paso Natural Gas Pipelines based upon 
historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused by these constraints 
are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or
