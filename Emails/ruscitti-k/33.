We are meeting with John Lavorato at 9:30 this morning to talk about hedging
the power side of this transaction.  Besides the gas bid we talked about 
yesterday,
please come up with a back-up plan to price the gas on a fixed price basis 
just
in case it takes us another day to address any other concerns that John may 
have.

Thanks,
Ruth
