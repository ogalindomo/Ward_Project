Kevin,

Siobhan let me know that she reached you last week.  Thanks for taking the
time to forward my credentials within Enron to their Wind operation.  I have
a resume and a general cover letter zipped to this email.

Just to let you know in case you speak with someone at Enron Wind, I sent a
"cold" resume about two weeks back for an opening in project sales/marketing
(Job codes 111363/111364).  They have many interesting projects on the table
and I am eager to talk with their recruiter about global openings.

Let me know if there is anything I must do to follow up or provide additional
information.  Thanks again for your help.

David
