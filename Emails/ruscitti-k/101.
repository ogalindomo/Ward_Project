It's time to say farewell. Next Thursday will be my last day at Enron, as I 
will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Over the years, I appreciated 
the opportunity to work with, to learn from and get to know all of you and 
hope we can stay in touch (my email address is finanseer@hotmail.com). I hope 
those in Houston can join me at Solero's after work on Thursday, Sept. 7 
(Deffner's buying!!).

Take care,
Matt
