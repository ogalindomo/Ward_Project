Kevin,
We're doing very well in Seoul.  It's been nearly a year since I first 
arrived, time flies.  We've had a frigid winter and it's just starting to 
thaw out now.  Work has been good, very challenging.  I'll be in Houston 
during the week of Feb 20th on business.  Why don't we plan to get together 
then.  I'll follow up.
