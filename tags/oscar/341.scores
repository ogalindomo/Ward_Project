Regarding the 5x265 update to 5x270 messages:  This is due to our runningdifferent Client(5x265)  and Server(5x270) versions at Enron at this time.; 0;
I have already submitted a fix for this and it will be taken care of as soonas the Enron Servers are restarted - which will be done tonight I hope.; 0;
