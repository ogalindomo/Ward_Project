"Unfortunately we have been unable to reach closure on the third party conditions, namely the ISRA and Bayonne consents, to our Transaction Agreement with El Paso."; 1;
We have therefore negotiated an extension of the deadline.; 1;
The terms of the extension include a non-refundable deposit to be paid to us by El Paso under certain circumstances and an extension to 22-Feb.  Hopefully the extension will allow sufficient time for these two remaining conditions to be satisfied.; 1;
This extensio is expected to be finalized tomorrow.; 1;
