A couple of the transaction documents are coming together a little more slowly than anticipated yesterday.; 1;
After an all day drafting session today there remain only a few manageable issues left to resolve.; 1;
Accordingly we have tentatively scheduled signing the definitive agreements on Monday 4-Dec.; 1;
Currently both parties have a termination right for internal approvals - El Paso approvals may be complete by Monday and I would like to have ours completed as well so that this termination right could be eliminated.; 0;
Please let me know what other information/documentation you will need so that we may complete our approval processes and sign these agreements on Monday without this clause.; 0;
Thanks again for your timely assistance with this transaction.; 0;
