Michelle, I reviewed the Project Canary Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement andoffer the following observations:In an asset transaction, where the buyer did not want to acquire or assumethe employee benefit plans of the seller, I have always recommended toinclude such plans and liabilities in the statement of excluded assets."; 1;
"Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of theAgreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans arenot excluded."; 1;
"Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an assettransaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding,compliance and administration of the plans."; 1;
These kinds of representationsare not in the Agreement.; 1;
"The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel andactuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respectto these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can beinserted into the financial model for determining the offering price."; 1;
You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel andactuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.; 1;
